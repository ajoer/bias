[CLS] On 9 January 2018, at approximately 8:51 p.m. [SEP] [CLS] local time (02:51 10 January UTC), a magnitude 7.5 earthquake struck in the Yucat√°n Basin of the Caribbean Sea, 44 kilometres (27 mi) east of Great Swan Island off the coast of Honduras. [SEP] [CLS] The earthquake was felt across Central America, and rattled windows in Tegucigalpa. [SEP] [CLS] The earthquake was also felt in the Cayman Islands. [SEP] [CLS] Tsunami advisories were issued for certain areas by the U.S. [SEP] [CLS] Tsunami Warning Center. [SEP] [CLS] They were later cancelled after further monitoring. [SEP] [CLS] No tsunami was generated since the earthquake was an almost pure strike-slip on a near vertical plane, producing little upward movement of the sea floor that would cause a large displacement of water.
