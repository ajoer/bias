[CLS] Tropical Cyclone Gretelle was a deadly storm that struck southeastern Madagascar in January 1997. [SEP] [CLS] The seventh named storm of the 1996–97 South-West Indian Ocean cyclone season, Gretelle developed within the intertropical convergence zone on January 19, and gradually intensified while moving southwestward. [SEP] [CLS] On January 22, the storm intensified to tropical cyclone status while passing northwest of Réunion; there, Gretelle produced strong wind gusts and heavy rainfall in mountainous regions. [SEP] [CLS] Subsequently, the cyclone strengthened to reach peak 10-minute sustained winds of 140 km/h (85 mph). [SEP] [CLS] On January 24, Gretelle made landfall near Farafangana, the first in the region in 41 years. [SEP] [CLS] The cyclone weakened while crossing Madagascar, but restrengthened slightly in the Mozambique Channel. [SEP] [CLS] Gretelle meandered off the coast of Mozambique, bringing gusty winds that downed trees, but caused little damage. [SEP] [CLS] An approaching trough turned the cyclone to the southeast, and Gretelle dissipated on January 31 to the south-southwest of Madagascar. [SEP] [CLS] Damage from Cyclone Gretelle was heaviest near where it made landfall in Madagascar. [SEP] [CLS] In several villages, over 90% of the buildings were destroyed, leaving about 80,000 people homeless. [SEP] [CLS] Wind gusts at Farafangan reached 220 km/h (140 mph), which knocked trees onto roads and wrecked about 138,000 tons of crops. [SEP] [CLS] Heavy rainfall and high waves flooded coastal regions, in some areas up to 16 m (52 ft) deep. [SEP] [CLS] Overall damage was estimated at around $50 million, and there were 152 deaths.
