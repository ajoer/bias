[CLS] Hurricane Paula was a small hurricane that struck Honduras and Cuba in October 2010. [SEP] [CLS] The eighteenth tropical cyclone, sixteenth named storm, and ninth hurricane of the season, Paula developed from a low pressure area over the southwestern Caribbean Sea on October 11. [SEP] [CLS] Moving northwestward, it slowly organized and was upgraded to a tropical storm shortly thereafter. [SEP] [CLS] Around midday on October 11, Paula made landfall near Cabo Gracias a Dios at the border of Honduras and Nicaragua. [SEP] [CLS] In northeastern Honduras, strong winds destroyed several homes, while rainfall destroyed a few roads and dozens of buildings, include a school and a police station. [SEP] [CLS] Favorable conditions such as low wind shear and warm sea surface temperatures allowed Paula to reach hurricane status early on October 12. [SEP] [CLS] Further intensification occurred, and the storm peaked with winds of 105 mph (165 km/h) while curving northward on October 13. [SEP] [CLS] Due to Paula's small size, impact in Mexico was minor, mainly limited to light rainfall and winds. [SEP] [CLS] However, an American tourist drowned offshore Cozumel. [SEP] [CLS] After Paula attained its peak intensity on October 13, wind shear began to increase, causing the storm to weaken. [SEP] [CLS] The storm turned north-northeastward and fell to tropical storm intensity on October 14. [SEP] [CLS] Shortly thereafter, Paula made landfall in the Cuban province of Pinar del Río. [SEP] [CLS] Early on October 15, Paula weakened to a tropical depression while moving eastward over Cuba, before degenerating into a remnant low pressure area about six hours later. [SEP] [CLS] In Cuba, rainfall was mostly beneficial. [SEP] [CLS] Strong winds, with gusts reaching 68 mph (109 km/h), left power outages in Pinar del Río and Artemisa provinces. [SEP] [CLS] In the Havana area, a few homes were deroofed, while falling trees blocked many roads. [SEP] [CLS] Impact in the Florida Keys was minimal, limited to light rainfall and increased tides.
