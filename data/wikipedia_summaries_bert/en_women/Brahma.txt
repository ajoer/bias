Brahma (Sanskrit: ब्रह्मा, IAST: Brahmā) is the creator god in Hinduism. [CLS] [SEP] He is also known as Svayambhu (self-born), Vāgīśa (Lord of Speech), and the creator of the four Vedas, one from each of his mouths. [CLS] [SEP] Brahma is consort of Saraswati and he is the father of Four Kumaras, Narada, Daksha, Marichi and many more. [CLS] [SEP] Brahma is synonymous with the Vedic god Prajapati, he is also known as Vedanatha (god of Vedas), Gyaneshwara (god of Knowledge), Chaturmukha (having Four Faces) Svayambhu (self born), etc, as well as linked to Kama and Hiranyagarbha (the cosmic egg). [CLS] [SEP] He is more prominently mentioned in the post-Vedic Hindu epics and the mythologies in the Puranas. [CLS] [SEP] In the epics, he is conflated with Purusha. [CLS] [SEP] Although Brahma is part of the Brahma-Vishnu-Shiva Trimurti, ancient Hindu scriptures mention multiple other trinities of gods or goddesses which do not include Brahma.The Brahma Purana describes that there was nothing, but an eternal ocean. [CLS] [SEP] From which, a golden egg, called Hiranyagarbha, emerged. [CLS] [SEP] The egg broke open and Brahma, who had created himself within it, came into existence (gaining the name Swayambhu). [CLS] [SEP] Then, he created the universe, the earth and other things. [CLS] [SEP] He also created people to populate and live on his creation.Several other Puranas describe him as emerging from a lotus, connected to the navel of Lord Vishnu. [CLS] [SEP] Other Puranas suggest that he is born from Shiva or his aspects, or he is a supreme god in diverse versions of Hindu mythology. [CLS] [SEP] Brahma, along with other deities, is sometimes viewed as a form (saguna) of the otherwise formless (nirguna) Brahman, the ultimate metaphysical reality in Vedantic Hinduism. [CLS] [SEP] In an alternate version, some Puranas state him to be the father of Prajapatis.According to some, Brahma does not enjoy popular worship in present-age Hinduism and has lesser importance than the other members of the Trimurti, Vishnu and Shiva. [CLS] [SEP] Brahma is revered in ancient texts, yet rarely worshiped as a primary deity in India. [CLS] [SEP] Very few temples dedicated to him exist in India; the most famous being the Brahma Temple, Pushkar in Rajasthan. [CLS] [SEP] Brahma temples are found outside India, such as at the Erawan Shrine in Bangkok. [CLS] [SEP]
