[CLS] Edwin Mattison McMillan (September 18, 1907 â€“ September 7, 1991) was an American physicist and Nobel laureate credited with being the first-ever to produce a transuranium element, neptunium. [SEP] [CLS] For this, he shared the Nobel Prize in Chemistry with Glenn Seaborg in 1951. [SEP] [CLS] A graduate of California Institute of Technology, he earned his doctorate from Princeton University in 1933, and joined the Berkeley Radiation Laboratory, where he discovered oxygen-15 and beryllium-10. [SEP] [CLS] During World War II, he worked on microwave radar at the MIT Radiation Laboratory, and on sonar at the Navy Radio and Sound Laboratory. [SEP] [CLS] In 1942 he joined the Manhattan Project, the wartime effort to create atomic bombs, and helped establish the project's Los Alamos Laboratory where the bombs were designed. [SEP] [CLS] He led teams working on the gun-type nuclear weapon design, and also participated in the development of the implosion-type nuclear weapon. [SEP] [CLS] McMillan co-invented the synchrotron with Vladimir Veksler. [SEP] [CLS] He returned to the Berkeley Radiation Laboratory after the war, and built them. [SEP] [CLS] In 1954 he was appointed associate director of the Radiation Laboratory, being promoted to deputy director in 1958. [SEP] [CLS] On the death of lab founder Ernest Lawrence that year, he became director, and he stayed in that position until his retirement in 1973. [SEP] [CLS]
