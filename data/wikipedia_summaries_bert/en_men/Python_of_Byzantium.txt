[CLS] Python of Byzantium (Greek: Πύθων ὁ Βυζάντιος) was an ancient Greek statesman and former student of Isocrates. [SEP] [CLS] In 346 BC, he appears to have participated in negotiations at Pella that resulted in the Peace of Philocrates. [SEP] [CLS] In 343 BC, Python represented Philip II of Macedon in Athens with an offer to alter the overall treaty. [SEP] [CLS] Hegesippus remarked that Python oratorically adhered to the instructions of his teachers in Athens (implying that Isocrates was a supporter of Macedon since he retained some influence over Python). [SEP] [CLS] Based on Demosthenes's Against Aristocrates, Python of Byzantium was identified with Python of Aenus the latter of which killed King Cotys I of the Odrysian Kingdom. [SEP] [CLS] However, it is highly unlikely that both names are attributed to one individual. [SEP] [CLS]
