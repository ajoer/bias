Tropical Cyclone Raquel was the first tropical cyclone to exist within the South Pacific Ocean during the month of July on record. [CLS] [SEP] The system was first noted during June 28, 2015, while it was located to the northeast of Honiara in the Solomon Islands within the South Pacific basin. [CLS] [SEP] Over the next few days the system moved south-westwards towards the Solomon Islands, under the influence of a ridge of high pressure and gradually developed further. [CLS] [SEP] The system was subsequently named Raquel during June 30, as it moved into the Australian region and developed into a Category 1 tropical cyclone on the Australian tropical cyclone intensity scale. [CLS] [SEP] Strong vertical wind shear subsequently limited further development of the system, with atmospheric convection surrounding the system displaced to the west and south of the system. [CLS] [SEP] The system subsequently weakened into a tropical depression during July 2, after it had recurved and move eastwards into the South Pacific basin. [CLS] [SEP] During that day atmospheric convection surrounding the system improved, as it started to move towards the south-southwest and the Australian region. [CLS] [SEP] Raquel subsequently passed near or over several of the Solomon Islands between July 3â€“5, before it was last noted to the south-west of Guadalcanal during July 5, as it rapidly lost its tropical characteristics. [CLS] [SEP] Raquel brought major flooding to the Solomon Islands where significant damage took place; including a large amount of agricultural damage and structural damage to hundreds of homes.
