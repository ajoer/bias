[CLS] The 1893 Brisbane flood, occasionally referred to as the Great Flood of 1893 or the Black February flood, occurred in 1893 in Brisbane, Queensland, Australia. [SEP] [CLS] The Brisbane River burst its banks on three occasions in February 1893. [SEP] [CLS] It was the occurrence of three major floods in the same month that saw the period named "Black February". [SEP] [CLS] There was also a fourth flood event later in the same year in June. [SEP] [CLS] The river runs through the centre of Brisbane with much of the population living in areas beside the river. [SEP] [CLS] It was flooded in the first flood on 6 February due to a deluge associated with a tropical cyclone, called "Buninyong".The second cyclone struck on 11 February, causing relatively minor flooding compared to the first flood. [SEP] [CLS] When the third cyclone came on 19 February, it was almost as devastating as the first, and it left up to one third of Brisbane's residents homeless. [SEP] [CLS] This time however the flood in the Brisbane River was largely from waters from the upper reaches of Brisbane River, rather than the Stanley River. [SEP] [CLS] The 1893 floods caused 35 deaths. [SEP] [CLS] For the first flood, Crohamhurst recorded an all-time Australian record of 907 millimetres (35.7 in) of rain in a 24-hour period. [SEP] [CLS] The water surge was recorded on the Port Office gauge (now the City gauge) as being 8.35 metres (27 feet, 5 inches) above the low tide level. [SEP] [CLS] The February 1893 floods were the second and third highest water levels ever recorded at the City gauge, the highest being the January 1841 flood at 8.43 metres (27 feet, 8 inches). [SEP] [CLS] There was however some oral aboriginal history suggesting a flood level of nearly 12 m prior to the first European settlement. [SEP] [CLS] The 1893 events was preceded by two notable yet less severe floods in 1887 and 1890. [SEP] [CLS] Both were caused by high levels of summer rainfall; however the rainfall around this period (with the exception of the two summers) was described as "very low". [SEP] [CLS]
