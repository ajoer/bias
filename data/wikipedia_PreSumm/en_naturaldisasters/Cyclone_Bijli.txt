[CLS] Cyclone Bijli (JTWC designation: 01B, also known as Cyclonic Storm Bijli), was the first tropical cyclone to form during the 2009 North Indian Ocean cyclone season. [SEP] [CLS] Bijli formed from an area of Low Pressure on April 14. [SEP] [CLS] Later that evening, RSMC New Delhi upgraded the low pressure area to a Depression and designated it as BOB 01. [SEP] [CLS] The Joint Typhoon Warning Center (JTWC) then issued a Tropical Cyclone Formation Alert for the system and soon after designated it as Tropical Depression 01B. [SEP] [CLS] On the evening of April 15, both RSMC New Delhi and the JTWC reported that the system had intensified into a tropical storm, with the former naming it Bilji. [SEP] [CLS] Soon after, Bilji reached its peak intensity as it approached the coast of Bangladesh. [SEP] [CLS] However, on the morning of April 17, Bijli weakened to a deep depression due to land interaction, before making landfall just south of Chittagong. [SEP] [CLS] The remnants of Bilji continued to weaken as they tracked across northern Myanmar, before RSMC New Delhi issued their last advisory on April 18.
