[CLS] Severe Cyclonic Storm Onil (India Meteorological Department designation: ARB 03; Joint Typhoon Warning Center designation: 03A) was the first tropical cyclone to be named in the northern Indian Ocean. [SEP] [CLS] Forming out of an area of convection several hundred kilometres southwest of India on October 1, Cyclone Onil quickly attained its peak intensity on October 2 with winds of 100 km/h (65 mph) and a barometric pressure of 990 mbar (hPa; 29.23 inHg). [SEP] [CLS] However, dry air quickly entered the system, causing it to rapidly weaken to a depression just off the coast of Gujarat, India. [SEP] [CLS] Over the following several days, the system took a slow, erratic track towards the south-southeast. [SEP] [CLS] After turning northeastward, the system made landfall near Porbandar on October 10 and dissipated shortly thereafter. [SEP] [CLS] Throughout southeastern Pakistan and northwestern India, thousands of residents were evacuated prior to the cyclone's arrival. [SEP] [CLS] In these areas, the storm produced moderate to heavy rainfall, peaking at 145 mm (5.7 in) in Thatta, Sindh, Pakistan. [SEP] [CLS] These rains led to flash flooding in several areas. [SEP] [CLS] Nine people died in several incidents related to the storm in Karachi. [SEP] [CLS] The drainage system of Hyderabad sustained significant damage, leading to several protests and demonstrations by city residents. [SEP] [CLS] Offshore, 300 fishermen are believed to have gone missing during the storm; no reports have confirmed their whereabouts since they disappeared. [SEP] [CLS]
