[CLS] Hurricane Hattie was one of the strongest and deadliest tropical cyclones of the 1961 Atlantic hurricane season, reaching a peak intensity as a Category 5 hurricane. [SEP] [CLS] The ninth tropical storm and seventh hurricane and major hurricane of the season, Hattie originated from an area of low pressure that strengthened into a tropical storm over the southwestern Caribbean Sea on October 27. [SEP] [CLS] Moving generally northward, the storm quickly became a hurricane and later major hurricane the following day. [SEP] [CLS] Hattie then turned westward west of Jamaica and strengthened into a Category 5 hurricane, with maximum sustained winds of 165 mph (270 km/h). [SEP] [CLS] It weakened to Category 4 before making landfall south of Belize City on October 31. [SEP] [CLS] The storm turned southwestward and weakened rapidly over the mountainous terrain of Central America, dissipating on November 1. [SEP] [CLS] Hattie first affected the southwestern Caribbean, where it produced hurricane-force winds and caused one death on San Andres Island. [SEP] [CLS] It was initially forecast to continue north and strike Cuba, prompting evacuations on the island. [SEP] [CLS] While turning west, Hattie dropped heavy rainfall of up to 11.5 in (290 mm) on Grand Cayman. [SEP] [CLS] The country of Belize, at the time known as British Honduras, sustained the worst damage from the hurricane. [SEP] [CLS] The former capital, Belize City, was buffeted by strong winds and flooded by a powerful storm surge. [SEP] [CLS] The territory governor estimated that 70% of the buildings in the city had been damaged, leaving more than 10,000 people homeless. [SEP] [CLS] The destruction was so severe that it prompted the government to relocate inland to a new city, Belmopan. [SEP] [CLS] Overall, Hattie caused about $60 million in losses and 307 deaths in the territory. [SEP] [CLS] Although damage was heavier in Hattie than a hurricane in 1931 that killed 2,000 people, the death toll from Hattie was less due to warnings. [SEP] [CLS] Elsewhere in Central America, Hattie killed 11 people. [SEP] [CLS]
