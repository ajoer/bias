Typhoon Krovanh, known in the Philippines as Typhoon Niña, was a moderate tropical cyclone that caused a swath of damage stretching from the Philippines to Vietnam in August 2003. [CLS] [SEP] The fifteenth named storm and sixth typhoon in the western Pacific that year, Krovanh originated from a tropical disturbance within the monsoon trough on August 13. [CLS] [SEP] Despite rather favorable conditions, the initial tropical depression did not intensify significantly and degenerated into a remnant low on August 18. [CLS] [SEP] However, these remnants were able to reorganize and the system was reclassified as a tropical cyclone a day later. [CLS] [SEP] Intensification was rather rapid upon the storm's reformation – the depression reached tropical storm status on August 20 and then typhoon intensity two days later. [CLS] [SEP] Shortly after, Krovanh made landfall on Luzon at peak intensity with winds of 120 km/h (75 mph). [CLS] [SEP] The typhoon emerged into the South China Sea as a much weaker tropical storm, though it was able to restrengthen over warm waters. [CLS] [SEP] Once again at typhoon intensity, Krovanh clipped Haiyan before moving over the Leizhou Peninsula on its way to a final landfall near Cẩm Phả, Vietnam on August 25. [CLS] [SEP] Quick weakening due to land interaction occurred as Krovanh moved across northern Vietnam, where the storm met its demise the following day. [CLS] [SEP] Krovanh first struck the Philippines, resulting in heavy rainfall and displacing approximately 1,000 families. [CLS] [SEP] The flooding caused severe damage and killed one person. [CLS] [SEP] Krovanh's effects were much more severe in China. [CLS] [SEP] In Hong Kong, eleven people were injured and isolated flooding occurred as a result of the typhoon's outer rainbands. [CLS] [SEP] However, Guangdong Province, Hainan Province, and Guangxi were the Chinese regions most extensively impacted. [CLS] [SEP] The typhoon brought record wind gusts into Guangxi. [CLS] [SEP] In those three regions combined, 13,000 homes were estimated to have collapsed and a large swath of farmland was damaged. [CLS] [SEP] Two people were killed in China and economic losses approximated at ¥2.1 billion (US$253 million). [CLS] [SEP] Due to its positioning and track, of all areas in Vietnam only the country's more northern regions were impacted by Krovanh. [CLS] [SEP] Flash flooding occurred in those regions, and 1,000 homes were flattened. [CLS] [SEP] One person was killed and five others were injured in Vietnam. [CLS] [SEP] Overall, the typhoon was responsible for the deaths of four persons. [CLS] [SEP]
