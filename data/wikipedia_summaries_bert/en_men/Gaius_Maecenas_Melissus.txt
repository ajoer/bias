[CLS] Gaius Maecenas Melissus (; fl. [SEP] [CLS] 1st century AD) was one of the freedmen of Gaius Maecenas, the noted Roman Augustan patron of the arts. [SEP] [CLS] His primary importance for Latin literature is that he invented his own form of comedy known as the "fabula trabeata" (tales of the knights). [SEP] [CLS] The genre did not prove particularly popular outside of his own work, but Melissus also put together compilations of jokes. [SEP] [CLS] Suetonius suggests that there were one hundred and fifty such compilations. [SEP] [CLS] Contemporary scholarship also suggests that he may have been quoted in Pliny the Elder's Natural History and may have been a grammarian as well, although none of his original works have survived.
