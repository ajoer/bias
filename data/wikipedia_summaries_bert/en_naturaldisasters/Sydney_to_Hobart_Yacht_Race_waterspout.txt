[CLS] The south coast tornado was a tornadic waterspout spawned by a supercell thunderstorm off the south coast of New South Wales on 26 December 2001, during the Sydney to Hobart Yacht Race. [SEP] [CLS] The tornado passed very close to the yacht Nicorette II, which was severely damaged but able to complete the race with a spare mainsail. [SEP] [CLS] Nicorette recorded wind speeds of close to 100 knots (120 mph; 190 km/h; 51 m/s) (making the tornado at least F2 on the Fujita scale) and was struck by hail the size of golf balls. [SEP] [CLS] According to the boat's meteorologist, the tornado began with a diameter of around 50 meters (160 feet), but grew in size until it was 500 meters (1,600 feet) across. [SEP] [CLS] The waterspout proceeded to strike several other boats with weaker winds. [SEP] [CLS] The tornado should not be confused with the severe storm that wrought havoc on the race in 1998.
