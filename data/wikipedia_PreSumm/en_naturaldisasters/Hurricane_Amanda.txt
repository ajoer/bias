[CLS] Hurricane Amanda was the strongest Eastern Pacific tropical cyclone ever recorded in the month of May. [SEP] [CLS] The first named storm, hurricane and major hurricane of the 2014 Pacific hurricane season, Amanda originated from a tropical wave that had entered the Eastern Pacific on May 16. [SEP] [CLS] Slow development occurred as it tracked westward, and development into a tropical depression occurred on May 22. [SEP] [CLS] The depression later strengthened into a tropical storm on May 23. [SEP] [CLS] Amid very favorable conditions, Amanda then rapidly intensified late on May 23, eventually reaching its peak intensity on May 25 as a high-end Category 4 hurricane. [SEP] [CLS] Afterwards, steady weakening occurred due to upwelling beneath the storm, and Amanda fell below major hurricane intensity on May 26. [SEP] [CLS] Rapid weakening occurred and the cyclone eventually dissipated on May 29. [SEP] [CLS] The tropical cyclone did not directly impact landmasses, however it had indirect impacts along the coast of Mexico.
