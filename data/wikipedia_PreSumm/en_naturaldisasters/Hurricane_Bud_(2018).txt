[CLS] Hurricane Bud was the first of six tropical cyclones to make a landfall in Mexico during the 2018 Pacific hurricane season. [SEP] [CLS] Bud was a powerful tropical cyclone that produced heavy rainfall and flash flooding across Northwestern Mexico and the Southwestern United States. [SEP] [CLS] However, the storm resulted in only minor damage. [SEP] [CLS] The second named storm, hurricane, and major hurricane of the season, Bud originated from a tropical wave that departed from Africa on May 29. [SEP] [CLS] It then traveled across the Atlantic Ocean before crossing over South America and entering the Northeast Pacific Ocean late on June 6. [SEP] [CLS] The system then moved northwest and steadily organized, becoming a tropical depression late on June 9 and Tropical Storm Bud early the next day. [SEP] [CLS] Favorable upper-level winds and ample moisture allowed the storm to rapidly intensify to a hurricane late on June 10 and further to a major hurricane on June 11. [SEP] [CLS] Bud ultimately peaked the next morning with maximum sustained winds of 140 mph (220 km/h) and a minimum barometric pressure of 943 mbar (hPa; 27.85 inHg). [SEP] [CLS] It curved north while rapidly succumbing to the effects of ocean upwelling, making landfall on Baja California Sur as a minimal tropical storm early on June 15. [SEP] [CLS] On the next day, land interaction and increasing wind shear caused Bud to degenerate to a remnant low, and Bud dissipated completely on June 16. [SEP] [CLS] Bud prompted the issuance of multiple watches and warnings for Baja California Sur and Western Mexico. [SEP] [CLS] Additionally, Bud caused one death in Mexico City. [SEP] [CLS] Damages from the storm were reported to be minimal. [SEP] [CLS] Rains from Bud brought relief to drought-stricken areas and slowed the growth of wildfires in the Southwestern United States. [SEP] [CLS]
