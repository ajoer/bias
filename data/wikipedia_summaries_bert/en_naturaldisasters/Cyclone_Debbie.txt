Severe Tropical Cyclone Debbie in 2017 was the strongest tropical cyclone to strike Queensland since Nathan in 2015, and was the costliest tropical cyclone in Australia since Yasi in 2011. [CLS] [SEP] Forming as a tropical low on 23 March, the low gradually intensified to a named tropical cyclone on 26 March. [CLS] [SEP] After steadily strengthening offshore to a Category 4 system, Debbie eventually made landfall near Airlie Beach, at 12:40 AEST on 28 March. [CLS] [SEP] Afterwards, Debbie rapidly weakened into a tropical low by late 28 March, but continued to travel south, causing significant damage and flooding in the populous areas of South East Queensland and Northern Rivers. [CLS] [SEP] In total, the storm caused A$3.5 billion (US$2.67 billion) in damage and fourteen deaths across Australia, primarily as a result of extreme flooding.
