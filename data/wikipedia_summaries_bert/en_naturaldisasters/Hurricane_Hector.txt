Hurricane Hector was a powerful and long-lived tropical cyclone that traversed all three North Pacific basins. [CLS] [SEP] The eighth named storm, fourth hurricane, and third major hurricane of the 2018 Pacific hurricane season, Hector originated from a disturbance that was located north of South America on July 22. [CLS] [SEP] The disturbance tracked westward and entered the eastern Pacific around July 25. [CLS] [SEP] It gradually organized over the next several days, becoming a tropical depression at 12:00 UTC on July 31. [CLS] [SEP] The system was upgraded into a tropical storm about 12 hours later and received the name Hector. [CLS] [SEP] Throughout most of its existence, the cyclone traveled due west or slightly north of west. [CLS] [SEP] A favorable environment allowed the fledgling tropical storm to rapidly intensify to its initial peak as a Category 2 hurricane by 18:00 UTC on August 2. [CLS] [SEP] Wind shear caused Hector to weaken for a brief period before the storm began to strengthen again. [CLS] [SEP] Hector reached Category 3 status by 00:00 UTC on August 4 and went through an eyewall replacement cycle soon after, which caused the intensification to halt. [CLS] [SEP] Upon completion, the cyclone continued to organize, developing a well-defined eye surrounded by cold cloud-tops. [CLS] [SEP] Hector crossed into the central Pacific Ocean early on August 6 as a Category 4 hurricane. [CLS] [SEP] Hector reached its peak intensity as a Category 4 hurricane around 18:00 UTC on the day, with winds of 155 mph (250 km/h) and a pressure of 936 mbar (27.64 inHg). [CLS] [SEP] Hector's intensity fluctuated between Category 3 and Category 4 over the next several days as a result of eyewall replacement cycles and changing environmental conditions. [CLS] [SEP] The hurricane passed south of the Big Island on August 8. [CLS] [SEP] Strong wind shear caused Hector to weaken rapidly and take on a more northwestward track after August 11. [CLS] [SEP] It fell below major hurricane intensity around 18:00 UTC on August 11 after spending a record 186 hours at that intensity. [CLS] [SEP] The structure of the storm rapidly deteriorated as Hector approached the International Date Line; it weakened into a tropical storm by 00:00 UTC on August 13. [CLS] [SEP] Hector crossed into the western Pacific Ocean during the middle of the day. [CLS] [SEP] The tropical storm then moved generally westward while continuing to decay. [CLS] [SEP] It weakened into a tropical depression by midnight UTC on August 15 and dissipated the next day around 18:00 UTC. [CLS] [SEP] While Hector did not make landfall, its close approach warranted the issuance of tropical storm watches and warnings for the Big Island, as well as tropical storm watches for the Northwestern Hawaiian Islands. [CLS] [SEP] Overall, the impact on land from the storm was minimal. [CLS] [SEP] Hector caused high surf as it passed by to the south of the main islands, necessitating the rescue of several dozen people on Oahu. [CLS] [SEP]
