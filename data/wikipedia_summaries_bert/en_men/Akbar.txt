Abu'l-Fath Jalal-ud-din Muhammad Akbar (Persian: ابو الفتح جلال الدين محمد اكبر; October 1542– 27 October 1605), popularly known as Akbar the Great, (Akbar-i-azam اکبر اعظم), and also as Akbar I (IPA: [əkbər]), was the third Mughal emperor, who reigned from 1556 to 1605. [CLS] [SEP] Akbar succeeded his father, Humayun, under a regent, Bairam Khan, who helped the young emperor expand and consolidate Mughal domains in India. [CLS] [SEP] A strong personality and a successful general, Akbar gradually enlarged the Mughal Empire to include much of the Indian subcontinent. [CLS] [SEP] His power and influence, however, extended over the entire subcontinent because of Mughal military, political, cultural, and economic dominance. [CLS] [SEP] To unify the vast Mughal state, Akbar established a centralised system of administration throughout his empire and adopted a policy of conciliating conquered rulers through marriage and diplomacy. [CLS] [SEP] To preserve peace and order in a religiously and culturally diverse empire, he adopted policies that won him the support of his non-Muslim subjects. [CLS] [SEP] Eschewing tribal bonds and Islamic state identity, Akbar strove to unite far-flung lands of his realm through loyalty, expressed through an Indo-Persian culture, to himself as an emperor. [CLS] [SEP] Mughal India developed a strong and stable economy, leading to commercial expansion and greater patronage of culture. [CLS] [SEP] Akbar himself was a patron of art and culture. [CLS] [SEP] He was fond of literature, and created a library of over 24,000 volumes written in Sanskrit, Urdu, Persian, Greek, Latin, Arabic and Kashmiri, staffed by many scholars, translators, artists, calligraphers, scribes, bookbinders and readers. [CLS] [SEP] He did much of the cataloging himself through three main groupings. [CLS] [SEP] Akbar also established the library of Fatehpur Sikri exclusively for women, and he decreed that schools for the education of both Muslims and Hindus should be established throughout the realm. [CLS] [SEP] He also encouraged bookbinding to become a high art. [CLS] [SEP] Holy men of many faiths, poets, architects, and artisans adorned his court from all over the world for study and discussion. [CLS] [SEP] Akbar's courts at Delhi, Agra, and Fatehpur Sikri became centres of the arts, letters, and learning. [CLS] [SEP] Timurid and Perso-Islamic culture began to merge and blend with indigenous Indian elements, and a distinct Indo-Persian culture emerged characterized by Mughal style arts, painting, and architecture. [CLS] [SEP] Disillusioned with orthodox Islam and perhaps hoping to bring about religious unity within his empire, Akbar promulgated Din-i-Ilahi, a syncretic creed derived mainly from Islam and Hinduism as well as some parts of Zoroastrianism and Christianity. [CLS] [SEP] Akbar's reign significantly influenced the course of Indian history. [CLS] [SEP] During his rule, the Mughal Empire tripled in size and wealth. [CLS] [SEP] He created a powerful military system and instituted effective political and social reforms. [CLS] [SEP] By abolishing the sectarian tax on non-Muslims and appointing them to high civil and military posts, he was the first Mughal ruler to win the trust and loyalty of the native subjects. [CLS] [SEP] He had Sanskrit literature translated, participated in native festivals, realising that a stable empire depended on the co-operation and good-will of his subjects. [CLS] [SEP] Thus, the foundations for a multicultural empire under Mughal rule were laid during his reign. [CLS] [SEP] Akbar was succeeded as emperor by his son, Prince Salim, later known as Jahangir. [CLS] [SEP]
