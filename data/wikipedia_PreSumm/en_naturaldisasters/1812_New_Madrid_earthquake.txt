[CLS] The 1811–12 New Madrid earthquakes () were a series of intense intraplate earthquakes beginning with an initial earthquake of moment magnitude 7.2–8.2 on December 16, 1811, followed by a moment magnitude 7.4 aftershock on the same day. [SEP] [CLS] Two additional earthquakes of similar magnitude followed in January and February 1812. [SEP] [CLS] They remain the most powerful earthquakes to hit the contiguous United States east of the Rocky Mountains in recorded history. [SEP] [CLS] The earthquakes, as well as the seismic zone of their occurrence, were named for the Mississippi River town of New Madrid, then part of the Louisiana Territory and now within the U.S. [SEP] [CLS] state of Missouri. [SEP] [CLS] The epicenters of the earthquakes were located in an area that at the time was at the distant western edge of the American frontier, only sparsely settled by European pioneers. [SEP] [CLS] Contemporary accounts have led seismologists to estimate that these stable continental region earthquakes were felt strongly throughout much of the central and eastern United States, across an area of roughly 130,000 square kilometers (50,000 sq mi), and moderately across nearly 3 million km2 (1 million sq mi). [SEP] [CLS] The 1906 San Francisco earthquake, by comparison, was felt moderately over roughly 16,000 km2 (6,200 sq mi). [SEP] [CLS] The New Madrid earthquakes were interpreted variously by American Indian tribes, but one consensus was universally accepted; the powerful earthquake had to have meant something. [SEP] [CLS] For many tribes in Tecumseh's pan-Indian alliance, it meant that Tecumseh and his brother the Prophet must be supported. [SEP] [CLS]
