Georges Charles Brassens (French pronunciation: ​[ʒɔʁʒ(ə) ʃaʁl bʁasɛ̃s]; 22 October 1921 – 29 October 1981) was a French singer-songwriter and poet. [CLS] [SEP] Now an iconic figure in France, he achieved fame through his elegant songs with their harmonically complex music for voice and guitar and articulate, diverse lyrics. [CLS] [SEP] He is considered one of France's most accomplished postwar poets. [CLS] [SEP] He has also set to music poems by both well-known and relatively obscure poets, including Louis Aragon (Il n'y a pas d'amour heureux), Victor Hugo (La Légende de la Nonne, Gastibelza), Paul Verlaine, Jean Richepin, François Villon (La Ballade des Dames du Temps Jadis), and Antoine Pol (Les Passantes). [CLS] [SEP] During World War II, he was forced by the Germans to work in a labor camp at a BMW aircraft engine plant in Basdorf near Berlin in Germany (March 1943). [CLS] [SEP] Here Brassens met some of his future friends, such as Pierre Onténiente, whom he called Gibraltar because he was "steady as a rock." They would later become close friends. [CLS] [SEP] After being given ten days' leave in France, he decided not to return to the labor camp. [CLS] [SEP] Brassens took refuge in a small cul-de-sac called "Impasse Florimont," in the 14th arrondissement of Paris, a popular and working-class district, where he lived for several years with its owner, Jeanne Planche, a friend of his aunt. [CLS] [SEP] Planche lived with her husband Marcel in relative poverty: without gas, running water, or electricity. [CLS] [SEP] Brassens remained hidden there until the end of the war five months later, but ended up staying for 22 years. [CLS] [SEP] Planche was the inspiration for Brassens's song Jeanne. [CLS] [SEP] He wrote and sang, with his guitar, more than a hundred of his poems. [CLS] [SEP] Between 1952 and 1976, he recorded fourteen albums that include several popular French songs such as Les copains d'abord, Chanson pour l'Auvergnat, La mauvaise réputation, and Mourir pour des idées. [CLS] [SEP] Most of his texts are tinged with black humour and are often anarchist-minded. [CLS] [SEP] In 1967, he received the Grand Prix de Poésie of the Académie française. [CLS] [SEP] Apart from Paris and Sète, he lived in Crespières (near Paris) and in Lezardrieux (Brittany). [CLS] [SEP]
