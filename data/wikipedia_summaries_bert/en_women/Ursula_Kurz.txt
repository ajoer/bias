[CLS] [SEP] He acquired his Matura in 2004 at the GRG 12 Erlgasse and subsequently completed mandatory military service in 2005. [CLS] [SEP] Kurz attended the faculty of law at the University of Vienna, and left before graduating to focus on his political career. [CLS] [SEP] He entered politics by joining the Young People's Party (JVP) in 2003. [CLS] [SEP] Five years later he assumed his first political office there as chairman of the JVP for Vienna. [CLS] [SEP] In 2010, Kurz successfully ran for the Viennese State Diet and thereby obtained his first governmental post. [CLS] [SEP] Following a reshuffle of the First Faymann cabinet in 2011, Kurz was nominated and appointed state secretary of the Interior Ministry for social integration. [CLS] [SEP] After the 2013 legislative election, Kurz became foreign minister of Austria and remained the country's top diplomat until December 2017. [CLS] [SEP] Following the resignation of Vice Chancellor Reinhold Mitterlehner as chairman of the People's Party (ÖVP) in May 2017, Kurz was named his successor. [CLS] [SEP] Mitterlehner's withdrawal from politics led to the end of the Kern cabinet and triggered a legislative snap election in 2017; in which Kurz participated as the top candidate of his party. [CLS] [SEP] As leader of the largest party after the election, Kurz was charged with forming his first cabinet and subsequently formed a coalition with the Freedom Party (FPÖ). [CLS] [SEP] During his chancellorship, Kurz passed many changes and reforms but suffered multiple scandals. [CLS] [SEP] Following the Ibiza affair and the end of the ÖVP–FPÖ majority coalition, Kurz was dismissed by the National Council through a motion of no confidence passed by the SPÖ, FPÖ and Jetzt in May 2019. [CLS] [SEP] After the 2019 legislative snap elections, he returned to power, forming another coalition – this time with the environmentalist Green Party. [CLS] [SEP] His youth and political tenor have been credited with revitalizing the traditional conservative movement in Austria, and to a larger extent, in Europe.

[CLS] [SEP] Aged 33, Kurz is the youngest head of government in the world, and first elected to the post aged 31, the youngest chancellor in Austrian history. [CLS] [SEP]
