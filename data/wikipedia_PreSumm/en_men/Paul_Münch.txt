[CLS] The Scream is the popular name given to a composition created by Norwegian Expressionist artist Edvard Munch in 1893. [SEP] [CLS] The original German title given by Munch to his work was Der Schrei der Natur (The Scream of Nature), and the Norwegian title is Skrik (Shriek). [SEP] [CLS] The agonised face in the painting has become one of the most iconic images of art, seen as symbolising the anxiety of the human condition. [SEP] [CLS] Munch recalled that he had been out for a walk at sunset when suddenly the setting sunlight turned the clouds "a blood red". [SEP] [CLS] He sensed an "infinite scream passing through nature". [SEP] [CLS] Scholars have located the spot to a fjord overlooking Oslo (59°54′02.4″N 10°46′12.9″E), and have suggested other explanations for the unnaturally orange sky, ranging from the effects of a volcanic eruption to a psychological reaction by Munch to his sister’s commitment at a nearby lunatic asylum. [SEP] [CLS] Munch created two versions in paint and two in pastels, as well as a lithograph stone from which several prints survive. [SEP] [CLS] Both of the painted versions have been stolen, but since recovered. [SEP] [CLS] One of the pastel versions commanded the fourth highest nominal price paid for a painting at a public auction. [SEP] [CLS]
