Digunai (24 February 1122 – 15 December 1161), also known by his sinicised name Wanyan Liang and his formal title Prince of Hailing (or Hailing Wang), was the fourth emperor of the Jurchen-led Jin dynasty, which ruled northern China between the 12th and 13th centuries. [CLS] [SEP] He was the second son of Wanyan Zonggan (完顏宗幹), the eldest son of Aguda (Emperor Taizu) (the founder of the Jin dynasty). [CLS] [SEP] He came to power in 1150 after overthrowing and murdering his predecessor, Emperor Xizong, in a coup d'état. [CLS] [SEP] During his reign, he moved the Jin capital from Shangjing (present-day Acheng District, Harbin, Heilongjiang Province) to Yanjing (present-day Beijing), and introduced a policy of sinicisation. [CLS] [SEP] In 1161, after the Jin dynasty lost the Battle of Caishi against the Southern Song dynasty, Digunai's subordinates rebelled against him and assassinated him. [CLS] [SEP] After his death, even though he ruled as an emperor during his lifetime, he was posthumously demoted to the status of a prince – "Prince Yang of Hailing" – in 1162 by his successor, Emperor Shizong. [CLS] [SEP] However, in 1181, Emperor Shizong further posthumously demoted him to the status of a commoner, hence he is also known as the "Commoner of Hailing". [CLS] [SEP]
