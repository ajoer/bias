[SEP] [CLS] The following day, the cyclone reached its peak intensity with winds of 250 km/h (155 mph 10-minute sustained) and a barometric pressure of 904 hPa (mbar). [SEP] [CLS] Orson maintained this intensity for nearly two days before making landfall near Dampier. [SEP] [CLS] The cyclone rapidly weakened after landfall as it accelerated to the southeast.
