[CLS] In 1257, a catastrophic eruption occurred at Samalas volcano on the Indonesian island of Lombok. [SEP] [CLS] The event had a probable Volcanic Explosivity Index of 7, making it one of the largest volcanic eruptions during the current Holocene epoch. [SEP] [CLS] It created eruption columns reaching tens of kilometres into the atmosphere and pyroclastic flows that buried much of Lombok and crossed the sea to reach the neighbouring island of Sumbawa. [SEP] [CLS] The flows destroyed human habitations, including the city of Pamatan, which was the capital of a kingdom on Lombok. [SEP] [CLS] Ash from the eruption fell as far as 340 kilometres (210 mi) away in Java; the volcano deposited more than 10 cubic kilometres (2.4 cu mi) of rocks and ash. [SEP] [CLS] The eruption was witnessed by people who recorded it on the Babad Lombok, a document written on palm leaves. [SEP] [CLS] It left behind a large caldera that contains Lake Segara Anak. [SEP] [CLS] Later volcanic activity created more volcanic centres in the caldera, including the Barujari cone, which remains active. [SEP] [CLS] The aerosols injected into the atmosphere reduced the solar radiation reaching the Earth's surface, cooling the atmosphere for several years and leading to famines and crop failures in Europe and elsewhere, although the exact scale of the temperature anomalies and their consequences is still debated. [SEP] [CLS] The eruption may have helped trigger the Little Ice Age, a centuries-long cold period during the last thousand years. [SEP] [CLS] Before the site of the eruption was known, an examination of ice cores around the world had found a large spike in sulfate deposition around 1257, providing strong evidence of a large volcanic eruption having occurred somewhere in the world. [SEP] [CLS] In 2013, scientists linked the historical records about Mount Samalas to these spikes. [SEP] [CLS]
