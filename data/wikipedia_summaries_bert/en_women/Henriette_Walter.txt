The influence of French on the English language pertains mainly to its lexicon, but also to its syntax, grammar, orthography and pronunciation. [CLS] [SEP] The majority of the French vocabulary in English entered the language after the Norman conquest of England in 1066, when Old French, and specifically the Old Norman dialect, became the language of the new Anglo-Norman court, the government, and of the elites for several centuries. [CLS] [SEP] This period lasted until the aftermath of the Hundred Years' War (1337â€“1453). [CLS] [SEP] Even since then, English has continuously been influenced by the French language. [CLS] [SEP] According to Laura K. [CLS] [SEP] Lawless, more than a third of the modern English lexicon is of French origin, while Henriette Walter claims that the total is as high as two thirds. [CLS] [SEP] Anthony Lacoudre has estimated that over 40,000 English words come directly from French and may be understood without orthographical change by French speakers. [CLS] [SEP]
