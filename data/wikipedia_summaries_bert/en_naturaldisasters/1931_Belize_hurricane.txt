[CLS] The 1931 British Honduras hurricane was the deadliest hurricane in the history of British Honduras (known as Belize since 1973), killing an estimated 2,500 people. [SEP] [CLS] The hurricane was first detected as a tropical wave off the west coast of Africa on 29 August. [SEP] [CLS] Moving westward, the disturbance remained relatively weak until 6 September, when it was first classified as a tropical cyclone just west of the Windward Islands. [SEP] [CLS] The depression gradually intensified, reaching tropical storm intensity within the first six hours following tropical cyclogenesis. [SEP] [CLS] The cyclone intensified further to hurricane intensity by 8 September. [SEP] [CLS] Strengthening and organisation remained gradual until the storm reached the Gulf of Honduras, by which time it began to rapidly intensify, reaching Category 4 hurricane intensity on 10 September. [SEP] [CLS] The hurricane subsequently made landfall in Belize City with maximum sustained winds of 135 mph (215 km/h). [SEP] [CLS] Moving across the Yucat√°n Peninsula, the tropical cyclone weakened, and continued to do so when it moved across the Bay of Campeche. [SEP] [CLS] This track brought it to a second landfall north of Tampico, Mexico, as a tropical storm on 13 September. [SEP] [CLS] Once inland, the storm quickly weakened and dissipated later that day. [SEP] [CLS] Possibly due to celebrations of the anniversary of the defeat of Spanish conquerors by the British in 1798, there was little warning of the storm in British Honduras. [SEP] [CLS] At St. [SEP] [CLS] George's Caye, many structures were washed away by abnormally high tides and storm surge. [SEP] [CLS] Belize City was devastated, with the entire city being inundated with at least 5 ft (1.5 m) of water. [SEP] [CLS] Property on six streets was completely swept away, while overall 70% of the city was destroyed. [SEP] [CLS] Among the buildings severely damaged or demolished included many buildings and resident halls at St. [SEP] [CLS] John's College and the U.S. [SEP] [CLS] Embassy building; the Consul suffered fatal injuries during the collapse of the building. [SEP] [CLS] Further inland, severe damage to agriculture occurred. [SEP] [CLS] Overall, the storm left $7.5 million (1931 USD) in damage. [SEP] [CLS]
