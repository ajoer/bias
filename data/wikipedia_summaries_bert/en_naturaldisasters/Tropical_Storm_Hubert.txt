Severe Tropical Storm Hubert was a destructive tropical cyclone that killed 85 people throughout Madagascar early March 2010. [CLS] [SEP] Forming out of a slow-moving area of low pressure on March 9, Hubert quickly developed within a region favoring tropical development. [CLS] [SEP] Situated off the coast of Madagascar, the storm attained peak winds of 100 km/h (65 mph) just hours before making landfall on March 10 near Mananjary in Fianarantsoa Province. [CLS] [SEP] Rapid weakening took place once over land, with the storm losing gale-force winds late on March 11. [CLS] [SEP] The remnants of Hubert persisted for several more days, eventually dissipating off the southern coast of Madagascar on March 15.
