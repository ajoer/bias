Hurricane Stan was a relatively weak but deadly tropical cyclone that affected areas of Central America in early October 2005. [CLS] [SEP] The eighteenth named storm and eleventh hurricane of the 2005 Atlantic hurricane season, Stan formed from a tropical wave on October 1 after it had moved into the western Caribbean Sea. [CLS] [SEP] The depression slowly intensified, and reached tropical storm intensity the following day, before subsequently making its first landfall on the Yucat√°n Peninsula. [CLS] [SEP] Traversing the peninsula, the tropical storm weakened, but was able to re-intensify once it entered the Bay of Campeche. [CLS] [SEP] Under favorable conditions for tropical development, Stan attained hurricane strength on October 4, and later reached peak intensity with winds of 80 mph (130 km/h) and a minimum barometric pressure of 977 mbar (hPa; 28.85 inHg). [CLS] [SEP] The hurricane maintained this intensity until landfall near Punta Roca Partida, Mexico later the same day. [CLS] [SEP] Once over the mountainous terrain of Mexico, however, Stan quickly weakened, and dissipated on October 5. [CLS] [SEP] Due to Stan's position within a large area of convective activity and thunderstorms, the hurricane's effects were far-reaching and widespread across Central America. [CLS] [SEP] Flash floods generated by the hurricane caused severe crop losses, particularly to coffee crops. [CLS] [SEP] Overall, Stan caused at least 1,668 deaths across six countries, with many others unaccounted for. [CLS] [SEP] Most of these fatalities occurred in Guatemala, and were mostly caused by mudslides triggered by torrential rainfall. [CLS] [SEP] The floods in Guatemala destroyed entire towns and disrupted exportation of petroleum. [CLS] [SEP] In Mexico, the heavy rains triggered additional mudslides and caused rivers to overflow, flooding nearby villages. [CLS] [SEP] Despite being relatively far from Stan as opposed to other countries, El Salvador was also severely affected by the hurricane. [CLS] [SEP] The Santa Ana Volcano erupted while Stan was producing heavy rains in the country, which contributed to the damage already wrought by mudslides. [CLS] [SEP] Transportation in the country was disrupted. [CLS] [SEP] Across the region, Stan caused $3.9 billion in damages, primarily due to torrential rainfall. [CLS] [SEP]
