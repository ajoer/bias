[CLS] [SEP] For this, he shared the Nobel Prize in Chemistry with Glenn Seaborg in 1951. [CLS] [SEP] A graduate of California Institute of Technology, he earned his doctorate from Princeton University in 1933, and joined the Berkeley Radiation Laboratory, where he discovered oxygen-15 and beryllium-10. [CLS] [SEP] During World War II, he worked on microwave radar at the MIT Radiation Laboratory, and on sonar at the Navy Radio and Sound Laboratory. [CLS] [SEP] In 1942 he joined the Manhattan Project, the wartime effort to create atomic bombs, and helped establish the project's Los Alamos Laboratory where the bombs were designed. [CLS] [SEP] He led teams working on the gun-type nuclear weapon design, and also participated in the development of the implosion-type nuclear weapon. [CLS] [SEP] McMillan co-invented the synchrotron with Vladimir Veksler. [CLS] [SEP] He returned to the Berkeley Radiation Laboratory after the war, and built them. [CLS] [SEP] In 1954 he was appointed associate director of the Radiation Laboratory, being promoted to deputy director in 1958. [CLS] [SEP] On the death of lab founder Ernest Lawrence that year, he became director, and he stayed in that position until his retirement in 1973. [CLS] [SEP]
