[CLS] The 2010 Indiana earthquake registered 3.8 on the moment magnitude scale and struck near Greentown and Kokomo on December 30, 2010 at 12:55:21 UTC at a depth of 3 mi. [SEP] [CLS] The quake occurred approximately 50 miles north of Indiana's capital, Indianapolis. [SEP] [CLS] It joins only three other earthquakes that have affected the northern Indiana area since 1999. [SEP] [CLS] The “extremely rare and unprecedented” earthquake had the largest magnitude of a northern Indiana earthquake in 175 years. [SEP] [CLS] Despite being considered a rare occurrence, the affected region of northern Indiana lies near many fault lines including the Wabash Valley Seismic Zone and the New Madrid Seismic Zone. [SEP] [CLS] Both zones are hotspots for tectonic activity, with the Wabash Valley Fault Zone reaching earthquake depths up to 18 km (11.4 mi.) deep. [SEP] [CLS] It was incorrectly recorded by nearby stations as a 4.2 magnitude before being downgraded to 3.8. [SEP] [CLS] No significant damage was reported from the incident, but the quake was felt by thousands, spanning across multiple cities and states. [SEP] [CLS] Towns as far away as Kalamazoo, Michigan and states as far as Wisconsin and Kentucky reported the earthquake. [SEP] [CLS]
