Tropical Storm Fernand was a short-lived tropical storm that caused severe flooding in northern Mexico in early September 2019. [CLS] [SEP] The sixth named storm of the 2019 Atlantic hurricane season, Fernand developed from a broad area of low pressure that was first monitored in the southeastern Gulf of Mexico on August 31. [CLS] [SEP] Gradual organization ensued as the low moved westward, and it developed into a tropical depression early on September 3. [CLS] [SEP] The cyclone quickly strengthened into Tropical Storm Fernand six hours after formation, and attained peak winds of 50 mph (85 km/h) early on September 4.

[CLS] [SEP] Fernand quickly weakened to a tropical depression as it moved over the Sierra Madre Oriental, and by 03:00 UTC on September 5, the cyclone had dissipated over the rugged terrain of Mexico.
