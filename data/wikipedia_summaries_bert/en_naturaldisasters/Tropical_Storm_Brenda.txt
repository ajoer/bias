The 1964 Atlantic hurricane season featured the highest number of U.S.-landfalling hurricanes since 1933. [CLS] [SEP] The season officially began on June 15, and lasted until November 30. [CLS] [SEP] These dates conventionally delimit the period of each year when most tropical cyclones form in the Atlantic basin. [CLS] [SEP] The season was above average, with thirteen named storms, seven hurricanes, and five major hurricanes. [CLS] [SEP] The first system, an unnamed tropical storm, developed on June 2, almost two weeks before the official start of the season. [CLS] [SEP] Striking Florida on June 6, the storm brought localized flooding to portions of Cuba and the Southeastern United States, leaving about $1 million in damage. [CLS] [SEP] The next storm, also unnamed, developed near the end of July; it did not impact land. [CLS] [SEP] The effects of Hurricanes Cleo, Dora, and Isbell combined were devastating to Florida. [CLS] [SEP] Cleo also brought destruction to portions of the Caribbean, especially Guadeloupe and Haiti. [CLS] [SEP] After moving inland, Cleo brought flooding to states such as Virginia. [CLS] [SEP] Overall, the storm caused 219 deaths and about $187.5 million in damage. [CLS] [SEP] Dora lashed much of North Florida and southeastern Georgia with hurricane-force winds, leaving five fatalities and around $280 million in damage. [CLS] [SEP] In October, Isbell brought strong winds and several tornadoes to Florida, as well as flooding to Cuba and The Carolinas. [CLS] [SEP] Isbell killed seven people and left approximately $30 million in damage. [CLS] [SEP] The strongest tropical cyclone of the season was Hurricane Cleo, a powerful Category 4 hurricane that severely affected areas in the Caribbean, including the Leeward Islands, Haiti, and Cuba. [CLS] [SEP] Cleo went on to hit the United States, in the eastern Florida peninsula as a minimal Category 2 hurricane, particularly in Miami, Florida, where the storm brought severe damage to the state alone, and bringing heavy rain, and severe flooding to the Carolinas in the United States East Coast as a tropical storm. [CLS] [SEP] The names Cleo, Dora, and Hilda were retired following the season. [CLS] [SEP] Collectively, the tropical cyclones resulted in 270 fatalities and approximately $629.63 million in damage.
