[CLS] The 1909 Grand Isle hurricane was a large and deadly Category 3 hurricane that caused severe damage and killed more than 400 people throughout Cuba and the northern coast of the Gulf of Mexico. [SEP] [CLS] Forming out of a tropical disturbance just south of Hispaniola on September 13, 1909, the initial depression slowly intensified as it moved west-northwest towards Jamaica. [SEP] [CLS] Two days later, the system attained tropical storm intensity and turned northwestward towards Cuba. [SEP] [CLS] On September 16, it attained the equivalent of a modern-day Category 1 hurricane on the Saffir–Simpson Hurricane Scale and further strengthened to attain winds of 100 mph (155 km/h) before making landfall in Pinar del Río Province, Cuba on September 18. [SEP] [CLS] After a briefly weakening over land, the system regained strength over the Gulf of Mexico, with peak winds reaching 120 mph (195 km/h) the following day. [SEP] [CLS] After only slightly weakening, the hurricane increased in forward motion and made landfall near Grand Isle, Louisiana on September 21. [SEP] [CLS] The system quickly lost strength after moving over land, dissipating the following day over Missouri. [SEP] [CLS] In the Caribbean, little impact was known to have been caused by the storm outside of Cuba where rough seas killed 29 people. [SEP] [CLS] In the United States, the hurricane wrought catastrophic damage across Louisiana and Mississippi. [SEP] [CLS] Throughout these states, 371 people are known to have been killed, making it the sixth deadliest hurricane in United States history at the time; however, it has since been surpassed by five other cyclones. [SEP] [CLS] Along the Louisiana coastline, a powerful storm surge penetrated 2 mi (3.2 km) inland, destroying the homes of 5,000 people. [SEP] [CLS] Thousands of other homes throughout the affected region lost their roofs and telegraph communication was crippled. [SEP] [CLS] In terms of monetary losses, the storm wrought $11 million (1909 USD; $265 million 2010 USD) in damage throughout its path. [SEP] [CLS]
