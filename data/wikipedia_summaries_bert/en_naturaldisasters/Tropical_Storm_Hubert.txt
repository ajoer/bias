[CLS] Severe Tropical Storm Hubert was a destructive tropical cyclone that killed 85 people throughout Madagascar early March 2010. [SEP] [CLS] Forming out of a slow-moving area of low pressure on March 9, Hubert quickly developed within a region favoring tropical development. [SEP] [CLS] Situated off the coast of Madagascar, the storm attained peak winds of 100 km/h (65 mph) just hours before making landfall on March 10 near Mananjary in Fianarantsoa Province. [SEP] [CLS] Rapid weakening took place once over land, with the storm losing gale-force winds late on March 11. [SEP] [CLS] The remnants of Hubert persisted for several more days, eventually dissipating off the southern coast of Madagascar on March 15. [SEP] [CLS] Throughout much of central Madagascar, Hubert produced heavy rains, measured up to 137.5 mm (5.41 in) in Mananjary, that caused widespread flooding. [SEP] [CLS] Thousands of structures were destroyed by the ensuing floods and more than 66,000 people were left homeless. [SEP] [CLS]
