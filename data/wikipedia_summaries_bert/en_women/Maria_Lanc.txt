[CLS] Maria Lanc (born Maria Jenewein; 1911 – 15 November 1995) was an Austrian humanitarian. [SEP] [CLS] She lived in Gmünd, Lower Austria with her husband Arthur Lanc, a medical officer, in 1944. [SEP] [CLS] He and his wife owned the house number 35 in Kirchengasse. [SEP] [CLS] In the early summer of 1944 a carriage of 1700 Hungarian Jews which were sheltered in a grain silo, arrived in Gmünd. [SEP] [CLS] Arthur and Maria Lanc decided to help the inmates of the camp by all available means to alleviate their suffering. [SEP] [CLS] They collected clothes, food, medicine and baby linen. [SEP] [CLS] In the late autumn of 1944 an order was issued that in case that the frontline approaches the Jews should be transferred to a concentration camp in order to be killed. [SEP] [CLS] The date for the evacuation of the Jews was assigned for the end of March. [SEP] [CLS] Arthur Lanc hurried to the camp and decided to rescue three Jewish families - the family Fisch with three children aged five, four and one, the Yugoslavian nurse Piroska Blau and Georg Uhely, a lawyer from Ödenburg. [SEP] [CLS] In the night these three families flew through a small backdoor of the grain silo. [SEP] [CLS] At first the fugitives were hidden at the place of forester Christ, afterwards they were housed and hidden in the house of Arthur and Maria Lanc - conscious that an act like this was under threat of death penalty. [SEP] [CLS] On 16 December 1986 Maria Lanc and her husband Arthur Lanc were bestowed the medal of the Righteous among the Nations by Yad Vashem during a festive ceremony in Vienna. [SEP] [CLS]
