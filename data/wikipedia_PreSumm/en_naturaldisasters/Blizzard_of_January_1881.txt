[CLS] The Blizzard of January 1881 (17â€“20 January 1881) was one of the most severe blizzards ever to hit the southern parts of the United Kingdom. [SEP] [CLS] On 17 January 1881, a low pressure system rapidly developed in the English Channel. [SEP] [CLS] The snowfalls began on the 17th in the southwest and as the system deepened as it moved through the Channel, a gale force easterly developed over southern parts with heavy blizzards and drifting snow. [SEP] [CLS] The blizzard paralysed all transport, communication, trade and industries. [SEP] [CLS] Hundreds of miles of rail track were blocked by drifting snow, dozens of feet high in places.
