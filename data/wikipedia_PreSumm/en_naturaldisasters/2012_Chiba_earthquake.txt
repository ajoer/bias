[CLS] The 2012 Chiba earthquake (千葉県東方沖地震, Chiba-ken Toho-oki Jishin, lit. [SEP] [CLS] "Offshore Eastern Chiba Earthquake") occurred along the northeastern coast of Chiba Prefecture, Japan at 21:05 JST (12:05 UTC) on Wednesday, 14 March. [SEP] [CLS] Although its epicentre lay just offshore near Chōshi city, the shallow magnitude 6.1 Mj earthquake produced considerable shaking inland through much of the Bōsō Peninsula and lower Ibaraki Prefecture. [SEP] [CLS] It occurred as a result of normal faulting in a seismically quiet region, possibly in response to the magnitude 9.0 Mw 2011 Tōhoku earthquake. [SEP] [CLS]
