[CLS] The 1998 Kissimmee tornado outbreak of February 22–23, 1998, was a devastating tornado outbreak, the deadliest tornado event in Florida history, that is sometimes known as The Night of the Tornadoes. [SEP] [CLS] Affecting the I-4 corridor of Central Florida, including the Greater Orlando area, the tornadoes—among the strongest ever recorded in Florida—produced F3 (in some cases, near-F4) damage, killed 42 people, and caused 260 injuries. [SEP] [CLS] The previous record for the highest tornado death toll in Florida history was 17 on March 31, 1962. [SEP] [CLS] In all, 12 tornadoes touched down, one of which was long lived and tracked for nearly 30 miles (48 km). [SEP] [CLS] The first major, F3 tornado of the outbreak came at around 11:40 pm in Winter Garden, near Windermere in Orange County, killing three people. [SEP] [CLS] The deadliest and most destructive tornado of the night struck Kissimmee and St. [SEP] [CLS] Cloud, where 25 people were killed, and produced near-F4 damage.
