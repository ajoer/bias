[CLS] Emperor Xiaowu of Jin (simplified Chinese: 晋孝武帝; traditional Chinese: 晉孝武帝; pinyin: Jìn Xiàowǔ Dì; Wade–Giles: Chin Hsiao-wu-ti; 362–396), personal name Sima Yao (司馬曜), courtesy name Changming (昌明), was an emperor of the Eastern Jin Dynasty (265–420) in China. [SEP] [CLS] During his reign, Jin saw his dynasty survive a major attempt by Former Qin to destroy it, but he would nevertheless be the last Jin emperor to actually exercise imperial power, as his sons Emperor An and Emperor Gong would be controlled by regents and warlords. [SEP] [CLS] Emperor Xiaowu died an unusual death—he was killed by his concubine Honoured Lady Zhang after he insulted her. [SEP] [CLS]
