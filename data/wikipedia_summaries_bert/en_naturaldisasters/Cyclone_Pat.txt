Severe Tropical Cyclone Pat was a small but strong tropical cyclone that passed directly over Aitutaki, Cook Islands, in southern Pacific Ocean on February 10, 2010. [CLS] [SEP] Part of a series of storms to impact the group of islands early that year, Pat was first identified as a tropical depression on February 6 well to the northeast of the Samoan Islands. [CLS] [SEP] The storm steadily organized as it moved generally southeast, becoming a tropical cyclone on February 8. [CLS] [SEP] Turning to the south, intensification began in earnest and the system acquired hurricane-force winds within 48 hours of being named. [CLS] [SEP] The 445 km (275 mi) wide system displayed annular characteristics and a 19 km (12 mi) wide eye. [CLS] [SEP] Pat reached its peak strength early on February 10 as a severe tropical cyclone with winds of 140 km/h (85 mph) and a barometric pressure of 960 mbar (hPa; 28.35 inHg). [CLS] [SEP] Hours later it struck Aitutaki, producing gusts in excess of 185 km/h (115 mph) on the island. [CLS] [SEP] Hostile wind shear then prompted rapid weakening of the cyclone. [CLS] [SEP] The system degraded below gale-intensity on February 11, just 24 hours after it peaked, and was last noted early on February 12. [CLS] [SEP] Battering Aitutaki with wind gusts in excess of 185 km/h (115 mph), Cyclone Pat devastated the island. [CLS] [SEP] Approximately 78 percent of homes were damaged, with 72 structures destroyed. [CLS] [SEP] The electrical grid was left completely offline and supply of water was largely lost. [CLS] [SEP] Agriculture also experienced tremendous impact, with most crops completely lost. [CLS] [SEP] Damage on Aitutaki amounted to US$13.7 million; however, casualties were minimal with only eight minor injuries reported. [CLS] [SEP] Recovery efforts began immediately after the storm, with the Red Cross and the Government of New Zealand aiding the local government. [CLS] [SEP] A reconstruction plan was enacted by the Cook Islands within a month and subsequently funded by New Zealand. [CLS] [SEP] Owing to its destructive effects, the name Pat was later retired and replaced with Pili. [CLS] [SEP]
