[CLS] Atlantic Airways Flight 670 was a crash following a runway overrun of a British Aerospace 146-200A at 07:32 on 10 October 2006 at Stord Airport, Sørstokken, Norway. [SEP] [CLS] The aircraft's spoilers failed to deploy, causing inefficient braking. [SEP] [CLS] The Atlantic Airways aircraft fell down the steep cliff at the end of the runway at slow speed and burst into flames, killing four of sixteen people on board. [SEP] [CLS] The flight was chartered by Aker Kværner from Stavanger Airport, Sola via Sørstokken to transport its employees from there and Stord to Molde Airport, Årø. [SEP] [CLS] An investigation was carried out by the Accident Investigation Board Norway (AIBN). [SEP] [CLS] It was not able to find the underlying cause of the spoiler malfunction. [SEP] [CLS] However, it found that, when the captain selected the emergency braking, the anti-lock braking system was disabled. [SEP] [CLS] This selection caused the brakes to completely lock, resulting in reverted rubber hydroplaning, a condition in which the tires became extremely hot due to frictional forces, and the damp runway surface evaporated to steam, effectively causing the tires to float on a cushion of steam over the runway surface, greatly reducing braking action. [SEP] [CLS] This situation was made worse with a minimal runway end safety area and lack of grooves in the runway surface. [SEP] [CLS]
