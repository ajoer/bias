[CLS] Olympic Airways v. [SEP] [CLS] Husain, 540 U.S. [SEP] [CLS] 644 (2004), was a United States Supreme Court case related to Olympic Airways Flight 417. [SEP] [CLS] The case arose from the death on 4 January 1998 of Dr. [SEP] [CLS] Abid Hanson, a passenger on Olympic Airways Flight 417 from Cairo, Egypt, via Athens, Greece, to New York City in the United States. [SEP] [CLS] Hanson died following exposure to secondhand smoke.Dr. [SEP] [CLS] Hanson, who had a "history of recurrent anaphylactic reactions" and sensitivity to secondhand smoke, had requested a non-smoking seat. [SEP] [CLS] When the family boarded the Boeing 747 aircraft in Athens, the family found that the assigned seats were three rows ahead of the economy-class smoking area; there was no partition between the smoking and non-smoking sections. [SEP] [CLS] The family repeatedly requested a seat farther away from the smoking section but the flight attendant, Maria Leptourgou, would not move the passenger to any of the eleven other unoccupied seats on the aircraft. [SEP] [CLS] Hanson felt a reaction to the smoke and died several hours later, despite his doctor's aid. [SEP] [CLS]
