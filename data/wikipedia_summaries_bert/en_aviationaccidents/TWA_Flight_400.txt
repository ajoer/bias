On April 1, 1956, a Martin 4-0-4, registration #N40403, operating as TWA Flight 400, crashed on takeoff from Greater Pittsburgh International Airport (PIT). [CLS] [SEP] Twenty-two of the 36 people aboard the aircraft, including one crewmember, perished in the crash.Flight 400 was to be an IFR flight to Newark International Airport (EWR) in Newark, NJ. [CLS] [SEP] On this particular flight, the first officer was in the left seat, as he was being line-checked by the captain. [CLS] [SEP] As the aircraft became airborne, a sharp yaw was experienced while the first officer reduced power at an altitude of approximately 100 feet (30 m). [CLS] [SEP] Almost immediately, the fire warning light for the number one engine illuminated; however, the fire warning bell never sounded. [CLS] [SEP] At this point, the first officer is thought to have throttled down the number one engine. [CLS] [SEP] The captain had only noted the loss of power shown by the BMEP gauge, but never saw the fire warning light. [CLS] [SEP] He pulled the mixture to idle cutoff. [CLS] [SEP] As the first officer reached for the manual feathering button, the captain stopped him. [CLS] [SEP] The captain indicated that the autofeather device would feather the no. [CLS] [SEP] 1 prop. [CLS] [SEP] This never occurred, due to the throttle lever being retarded to a position aft of the switches that arm the auto-feathering system. [CLS] [SEP] The no. [CLS] [SEP] 1 prop created sufficient drag, causing the aircraft to continue to yaw to the left. [CLS] [SEP] At only 1,690 feet (515 m) past the runway's end, at 7:20 PM, the aircraft crashed. [CLS] [SEP] The fire warning appears to have been caused by an exhaust connector clamp failure. [CLS] [SEP] Hot exhaust gases were blown directly onto an overheat detector. [CLS] [SEP] Probable cause of the crash has been determined as: "Uncoordinated emergency action in the very short time available to the crew, which produced an aircraft configuration with insurmountable drag".
