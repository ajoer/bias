[CLS] Widerøe Flight 839, also known as the Værøy Accident (Norwegian: Værøy-ulykken), was a de Havilland Canada DHC-6-300 Twin Otter that crashed shortly after take-off from Værøy Airport in Norway. [SEP] [CLS] The incident occurred on 12 April 1990 at 14:44, killing all five people on board. [SEP] [CLS] The cause of the accident were strong winds that exceeded the structure's tolerance, causing the tail rudder and tailplane to crack so the plane became uncontrollable. [SEP] [CLS] Impact occurred 63 seconds after take-off and 8 seconds after the crack. [SEP] [CLS] The aircraft crashed into the water, and a search was conducted for several days to find the wreck. [SEP] [CLS] Uneven and strong winds had given the airport low regularity, and prior to take-off, wind speeds of 57 knots (106 km/h) had been recorded. [SEP] [CLS] The accident caused the airport to be permanently closed, and replaced by Værøy Heliport. [SEP] [CLS] The incident was investigated by the Accident Investigation Board Norway, who published their conclusions in 1991. [SEP] [CLS] Three years later, a new investigation was conducted, after an engineer had stated that the cause of the accident could instead have been fatigue. [SEP] [CLS] The second investigation came to the same conclusion as the first and all involved parties have since supported the causes made in the initial report. [SEP] [CLS]
