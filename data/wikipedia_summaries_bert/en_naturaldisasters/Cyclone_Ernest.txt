[CLS] Cyclone Ernest was one of two intense tropical cyclones in the 2004â€“05 South-West Indian Ocean cyclone season. [SEP] [CLS] The eighth tropical disturbance of the season, Ernest formed from a persistent area of thunderstorms in the central Indian Ocean. [SEP] [CLS] It initially moved southwestward, intensifying into Tropical Storm Ernest on January 20 while moving into the Mozambique Channel. [SEP] [CLS] After hitting Mayotte, the storm quickly intensified to reach peak winds of 165 km/h (105 mph 10 minute winds) off the western coast of Madagascar. [SEP] [CLS] Ernest weakened slightly before striking the southwest portion of that country on January 23, producing widespread flooding and gusty winds. [SEP] [CLS] The next day the cyclone became extratropical before dissipating on January 25. [SEP] [CLS] On Mayotte, Ernest produced peak wind gusts of 98 km/h (61 mph). [SEP] [CLS] The storm drew moisture away from Malawi, causing a nine-day period of dry conditions. [SEP] [CLS] A few days after Ernest struck Madagascar, Tropical Storm Felapi affected the same region and produced further flooding. [SEP] [CLS] The combined effects of the storms killed 78 people and left over 32,000 homeless. [SEP] [CLS] Widespread crop damage sparked food protests, although the World Food Programme provided an emergency supply of rice to affected residents. [SEP] [CLS]
