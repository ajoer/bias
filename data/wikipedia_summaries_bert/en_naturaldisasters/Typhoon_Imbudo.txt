Typhoon Imbudo, known in the Philippines as Typhoon Harurot, was a powerful typhoon that struck the Philippines and southern China in July 2003. [CLS] [SEP] The seventh named storm and fourth typhoon of the season, Imbudo formed on July 15 to the east of the Philippines. [CLS] [SEP] The storm moved generally west-northward for much of its duration due to a ridge to the north. [CLS] [SEP] Favorable conditions allowed Imbudo to intensify, gradually at first before undergoing rapid deepening on July 19. [CLS] [SEP] After reaching typhoon status, Imbudo strengthened further to peak 10–minute sustained winds of 165 km/h (105 mph) on July 20. [CLS] [SEP] The typhoon made landfall on northern Luzon near peak intensity on July 22, but quickly weakened over land. [CLS] [SEP] Once in the South China Sea, Imbudo re-intensified slightly before making its final landfall in southern China near Yangjiang on July 24, dissipating the next day. [CLS] [SEP] In the Philippines, Imbudo was the strongest typhoon in five years, causing widespread flooding and power outages in the Cagayan Valley for weeks.
