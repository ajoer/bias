The 1933 Outer Banks hurricane lashed portions of the North Carolina and Virginia coasts less than a month after another hurricane hit the general area. [CLS] [SEP] The twelfth tropical storm and sixth hurricane of the 1933 Atlantic hurricane season, it formed by September 8 to the east of the Lesser Antilles. [CLS] [SEP] It moved generally to the north-northwest and strengthened quickly to peak winds of 140 mph (220 km/h) on September 12. [CLS] [SEP] This made it a major hurricane and a Category 4 on the Saffir-Simpson scale. [CLS] [SEP] The hurricane remained at or near that intensity for several days while tracking to the northwest. [CLS] [SEP] It weakened approaching the southeastern United States, and on September 16 passed just east of Cape Hatteras, North Carolina with winds of about 100 mph (160 km/h). [CLS] [SEP] Turning to the northeast, the hurricane became extratropical on September 18 before moving across Atlantic Canada, eventually dissipating four days later. [CLS] [SEP] The threat of the hurricane prompted widespread tropical cyclone warnings and watches along the eastern United States and prompted some people to evacuate. [CLS] [SEP] Damage was heaviest in southeastern North Carolina near New Bern, where the combination of high tides and swollen rivers flooded much of the town. [CLS] [SEP] Across North Carolina, the hurricane caused power outages, washed out roads, and damaged crops. [CLS] [SEP] Several houses were damaged, leaving about 1,000 people homeless. [CLS] [SEP] Damage was estimated at $4.5 million, and there were 21 deaths in the state, mostly from drowning. [CLS] [SEP] Hurricane-force winds extended into southeastern Virginia, where there were two deaths. [CLS] [SEP] High tides isolated a lighthouse near Norfolk and covered several roads. [CLS] [SEP] Farther north, two people on a small boat were left missing in Maine, and another person was presumed killed when his boat sank in Nova Scotia. [CLS] [SEP]
