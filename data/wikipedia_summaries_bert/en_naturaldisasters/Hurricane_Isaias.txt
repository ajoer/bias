Hurricane Isaias () was a costly Category 1 hurricane that caused extensive damage across the Caribbean and the East Coast of the United States, including a large tornado outbreak that generated the strongest tropical cyclone-spawned tornado since Hurricane Rita in 2005. [CLS] [SEP] The ninth named storm and second hurricane of the 2020 Atlantic hurricane season, Isaias originated from a vigorous tropical wave off the coast of Africa that was first identified by the National Hurricane Center on July 23. [CLS] [SEP] The tropical wave gradually became more organized, and obtained gale-force winds on July 28, before organizing into Tropical Storm Isaias on July 30. [CLS] [SEP] Isaias marked the earliest ninth named storm on record, surpassing 2005's Hurricane Irene by eight days. [CLS] [SEP] Isaias strengthened into a Category 1 hurricane the next day, reaching a peak intensity of 85 mph (140 km/h) and a minimum central pressure of 987 mbar (hPa; 29.15 inHg). [CLS] [SEP] On August 1, the storm made landfall on North Andros, Bahamas and subsequently weakened to a tropical storm, before paralleling the east coast of Florida and Georgia. [CLS] [SEP] As Isaias approached the Carolina coastline, it reintensified back into a hurricane shortly before making landfall near Ocean Isle Beach, North Carolina, at 3:10 UTC on August 4. [CLS] [SEP] The storm proceeded to accelerate up the East Coast of the United States as a strong tropical storm, before transitioning into an extratropical cyclone over Quebec on August 5. [CLS] [SEP] Isaias' extratropical remnant persisted for another day, before dissipating on August 6. [CLS] [SEP] Numerous tropical storm watches and warnings as well as hurricane watches and hurricane warnings were issued for the Lesser Antilles, Greater Antilles, Bahamas, Cuba, and the East Coast of the United States. [CLS] [SEP] Isaias impacted portions of the Eastern Caribbean and caused significant damage in the Eastern United States. [CLS] [SEP] Devastating flooding and wind damage was reported in Puerto Rico and the Dominican Republic, with many towns without electricity or drinking water. [CLS] [SEP] Trees and power lines were downed in much of the Eastern United States, with more than 3 million power outages reported, nearly half of them in New Jersey. [CLS] [SEP] Isaias was the second tropical cyclone to affect the Northeastern States in a 3-week time span after Tropical Storm Fay in early July. [CLS] [SEP] Many people were without power for days after the storm in New York and Connecticut, leading to investigations into power and electricity companies. [CLS] [SEP] Eighteen people died in storm-related incidents: fifteen in the contiguous United States, two in the Dominican Republic, and one in Puerto Rico. [CLS] [SEP] Overall, Hurricane Isaias caused over $4.20 billion (2020 USD) in damage, with over $4 billion in damage alone in the U.S., making Isaias the costliest tropical cyclone to affect the Northeastern United States since Hurricane Sandy in 2012. [CLS] [SEP] The name "Isaias" was difficult to pronounce for many people, causing many weather forecasters and residents of affected areas to say it incorrectly. [CLS] [SEP]
