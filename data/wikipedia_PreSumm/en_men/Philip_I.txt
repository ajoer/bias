[CLS] Philip the Handsome (22 July 1478 â€“ 25 September 1506), also called the Fair, was Duke of Burgundy from 1482 to 1506 and the first member of the house of Habsburg to be King of Castile. [SEP] [CLS] The son of Holy Roman Emperor Maximilian I and Mary of Burgundy, Philip was less than four years old when his mother died, and upon her death, he inherited the Burgundian Netherlands. [SEP] [CLS] In 1496, his father arranged for him to marry Joanna, the second daughter of Queen Isabella I of Castile and King Ferdinand II of Aragon. [SEP] [CLS] Around the same time, Philip's sister Margaret was given in marriage to Joanna's brother John, as part of an agreement between their fathers. [SEP] [CLS] Within four years after the wedding, Joanna became heir presumptive to Aragon and Castile, following the deaths of her brother, elder sister and infant nephew during that period. [SEP] [CLS] In 1504, aged 26, Philip became king jure uxoris when his mother-in-law died and Joanna succeeded her. [SEP] [CLS] He died only two years later, leaving his wife distraught with grief. [SEP] [CLS] Philip was the first Habsburg monarch in Spain, and is the progenitor of every later monarch of Spain, even up to today. [SEP] [CLS] He died before his father, and therefore never inherited his father's territories or became Holy Roman Emperor. [SEP] [CLS] However, his son Emperor Charles V eventually united the Habsburg, Burgundian, Castilian, and Aragonese inheritances. [SEP] [CLS] Philip holds a special place in Habsburg history because he was the pivot around which the dynasty acquired a large portion of its extensive lands. [SEP] [CLS] By inheriting the Burgundian Netherlands and acquiring much of Spain and its possessions in the New World by marriage to Joanna, Philip was instrumental in vastly enhancing the territories of the Habsburgs, and his progeny would dominate European history for the next two centuries. [SEP] [CLS] Philip's wife Joanna was an elder sister to Catherine of Aragon, who married successively the brothers Arthur, Prince of Wales and King Henry VIII of England. [SEP] [CLS] He did once visit England, and the young Prince Henry was much impressed with him. [SEP] [CLS] Indeed, Henry is said to have regarded Philip as providing a model of leadership towards which he aspired. [SEP] [CLS]
