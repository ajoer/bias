Hurricane Dora was the first tropical cyclone on record to make landfall over the First Coast of Florida at hurricane intensity. [CLS] [SEP] The sixth tropical storm and second hurricane of the 1964 season, Dora developed from a tropical wave near the coast of Senegal on August 28. [CLS] [SEP] After a reconnaissance aircraft flight on September 1, the depression was upgraded to Tropical Storm Dora. [CLS] [SEP] It then curved northeastward and continued to strengthen. [CLS] [SEP] By early on September 3, Dora became a Category 1 hurricane. [CLS] [SEP] Six hours later, the storm reached Category 2 intensity. [CLS] [SEP] Intensification slowed somewhat, though Dora became a Category 3 on September 5. [CLS] [SEP] Deepening further, the storm peaked as a Category 4 with maximum sustained winds of 130 mph (215 km/h) early the following day. [CLS] [SEP] At 18:00 UTC on September 6, Dora weakened to a Category 3 hurricane, then a Category 2 hurricane while curving westward early the following day. [CLS] [SEP] Later on September 7, Dora continued to maintain Category 2 intensity on approaching the east coast of Florida, Dora's motion became erratic, making a few cyclonic loops. [CLS] [SEP] Around 04:00 UTC on September 10, the hurricane made landfall near St. [CLS] [SEP] Augustine, Florida, with winds of 110 mph (180 km/h), the hurricane fell to tropical storm intensity over land on September 11. [CLS] [SEP] Dora then briefly drifted over southwestern Georgia, until turned east-northeastward late the next day. [CLS] [SEP] Early on September 14, the storm re-emerged into the Atlantic Ocean near Cape Hatteras, North Carolina, and transitioned into an extratropical cyclone several hours later. [CLS] [SEP] The remnants of Dora moved rapidly northeastward and dissipated offshore Newfoundland early on September 16. [CLS] [SEP] Along the coast, tides reached up to 10 ft (3 m) above mean sea level. [CLS] [SEP] Strong winds lashed North Florida, with sustained wind of 125 mph (205 km/h) observed in St. [CLS] [SEP] Augustine. [CLS] [SEP] In Jacksonville, approximately 156,000 customers were left without electricity, while about 19% of phones in Duval County were out of service. [CLS] [SEP] Much of the damage in the Jacksonville area occurred to older buildings and those located in coastal areas. [CLS] [SEP] Additionally, sections of the city experienced wind-induced river flooding in the vicinity of the St. [CLS] [SEP] Johns River. [CLS] [SEP] Heavy rainfall damaged many unharvested crops and inundated numerous of roads and bridges, isolated some communities for several days. [CLS] [SEP] Throughout Florida, 74 dwellings were flattened and 9,374 received damage, while 14 mobile homes were destroyed and 218 others suffered severe impact. [CLS] [SEP] About 50 farm buildings and 423 small businesses were severely damaged or demolished. [CLS] [SEP] Three deaths and at least $230 million in damage occurred. [CLS] [SEP] In Georgia, the storm damaged about 1,135 homes and obliterated five others. [CLS] [SEP] Additionally, 18 trailers suffered major impact, while 43 small businesses were destroyed or experienced severe damage. [CLS] [SEP] There was one death in the state and at least $9 million in damage. [CLS] [SEP] A few other states were affected by the storm, though impact there was much lesser. [CLS] [SEP] One death occurred in Virginia. [CLS] [SEP] Overall, Dora caused $280 million in damage and five deaths. [CLS] [SEP]
