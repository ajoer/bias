[CLS] Hurricane Gilbert was an extremely powerful tropical cyclone that formed during the 1988 Atlantic hurricane season, peaked as a Category 5 strength hurricane that brought widespread destruction to the Caribbean and the Gulf of Mexico, and is tied with 1969's Hurricane Camille as the second-most intense tropical cyclone to make landfall in the Atlantic Ocean. [SEP] [CLS] Gilbert was also one of the largest tropical cyclones ever observed in the Atlantic basin. [SEP] [CLS] At one point, its tropical storm-force winds measured 575 mi (925 km) in diameter. [SEP] [CLS] In addition, Gilbert was the most intense tropical cyclone in recorded history to strike Mexico. [SEP] [CLS] Gilbert is also the second most intense tropical cyclone on record in the Atlantic basin in terms of barometric pressure, only behind Hurricane Wilma in 2005. [SEP] [CLS] The seventh named storm and third hurricane of the 1988 Atlantic hurricane season, Gilbert developed from a tropical wave on September 8 while located 400 mi (640 km) east of Barbados. [SEP] [CLS] Following intensification into a tropical storm the next day, Gilbert steadily strengthened as it tracked west-northwestward into the Caribbean Sea. [SEP] [CLS] On September 10, Gilbert attained hurricane intensity, and rapidly intensified into a Category 3 hurricane on September 11. [SEP] [CLS] After striking Jamaica the following day, rapid intensification occurred once again, and the storm became a Category 5 hurricane on the Saffir–Simpson hurricane wind scale late on September 13. [SEP] [CLS] Gilbert then weakened slightly, and made landfall on the Yucatán Peninsula later that day while maintaining Category 5 intensity. [SEP] [CLS] After landfall, Gilbert weakened rapidly over the Yucatán Peninsula, and emerged into the Gulf of Mexico as a Category 2 storm on September 15. [SEP] [CLS] Gradual intensification occurred as Gilbert tracked across the Gulf of Mexico, and the storm made landfall as a Category 3 hurricane in mainland Mexico on September 16. [SEP] [CLS] The hurricane gradually weakened after landfall, and eventually dissipated on September 19 over the Midwestern United States. [SEP] [CLS] Gilbert wrought havoc in the Caribbean and the Gulf of Mexico for nearly nine days. [SEP] [CLS] In total, it killed 318 people and caused about $2.98 billion (1988 USD) in damages over the course of its path. [SEP] [CLS] As a result of the extensive damage caused by Gilbert, the World Meteorological Organization retired the name in the spring of 1989; it was replaced with Gordon. [SEP] [CLS]
