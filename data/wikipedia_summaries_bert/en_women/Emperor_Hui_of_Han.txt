Emperor Hui of Han (or, Han Huidi, 210 BC – 26 September 188 BC) was the second emperor of the Han Dynasty in China. [CLS] [SEP] He was the second son of the first Han emperor, Han Gaozu (originally named Liu Bang, of the Liu family) and the lady who after the death of her husband, became the Empress Dowager Lü. [CLS] [SEP] Lu was her last name, and she was from the powerful Lu clan (House of Lu). [CLS] [SEP] Han Huidi is generally remembered as a somewhat weak character dominated and terrorized by his mother, Lü (Lu Hou, who became Empress Dowager after she encouraged her husband to personally general a war in which he died from an arrow wound). [CLS] [SEP] Huidi was personally kind and generous, but unable to escape the impact of Lu Hou's viciousness. [CLS] [SEP] However he did end the laws of Burning of books and burying of scholars. [CLS] [SEP] He tried to protect Ruyi, Prince Yin of Zhao, his younger half-brother, from being murdered by Empress Dowager Lü, but failed. [CLS] [SEP] After that, he indulged himself in drinking and sex, and died at a relatively young age. [CLS] [SEP] Emperor Hui's wife was Empress Zhang Yan, a niece of his by his sister Princess Yuan of Lu; their marriage was the result of insistence by Empress Dowager Lü and was a childless one. [CLS] [SEP] Empress Dowager Lü installed two of his alleged sons whom she adopted into her clan, Liu Gong and Liu Hong (known collectively as Emperors Shao of Han), the sons of the Emperor's concubine(s) after he died without a designated heir: however they and the rest of the Lu clan were exterminated and Han Wendi was established as emperor, as heir of the Liu clan, thus firmly establishing the succession of the Liu family as the dynastic family of Han.
