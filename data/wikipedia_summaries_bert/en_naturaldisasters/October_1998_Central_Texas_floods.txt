[CLS] Hurricane Madeline was the final tropical cyclone of the 1998 Pacific hurricane season. [SEP] [CLS] Madeline originated from a tropical wave that emerged off the coast of Africa on September 25, 1998. [SEP] [CLS] The wave traversed the Atlantic Ocean and crossed over Central America on October 5 or 6. [SEP] [CLS] Gradually, the system intensified and was classified as a tropical depression on October 16, a tropical storm later that day, and a hurricane on October 17. [SEP] [CLS] The storm reached peak winds of 85 mph (137 km/h) about 95 miles (153 km) southwest of San Blas, Nayarit, and after 18 hours it subsequently began to weaken. [SEP] [CLS] Although Madeline never made landfall, numerous rainbands affected the Mexican coast causing no known damage or fatalities. [SEP] [CLS] The remnant moisture moved north and contributed to flooding in central Texas, which killed 31 people and caused $750 million (1998 USD; $1.18 billion 2020 USD) in damage. [SEP] [CLS]
