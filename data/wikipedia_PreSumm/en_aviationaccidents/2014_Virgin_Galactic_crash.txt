[CLS] On October 31, 2014, the VSS Enterprise, a SpaceShipTwo experimental spaceflight test vehicle operated by Virgin Galactic, suffered a catastrophic in-flight breakup during a test flight and crashed in the Mojave Desert near Cantil, California. [SEP] [CLS] Co-pilot Michael Alsbury was killed and pilot Peter Siebold was seriously injured. [SEP] [CLS] The subsequent inquiry by the National Transportation Safety Board (NTSB) concluded that the breakup was the result of the premature activation by Alsbury of the air brake device used for atmospheric re-entry. [SEP] [CLS] The board also cited inadequate design safeguards, poor pilot training and lack of rigorous oversight by the Federal Aviation Administration (FAA) as important factors in the accident.
