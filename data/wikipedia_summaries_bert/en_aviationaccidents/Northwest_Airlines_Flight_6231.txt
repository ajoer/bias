Northwest Orient Airlines Flight 6231 was the fatal crash of a Boeing 727 on December 1, 1974 in Harriman State Park near Stony Point, New York, just north of the New York City area. [CLS] [SEP] The Northwest Airlines 727 had been chartered to pick up the Baltimore Colts professional football team in Buffalo in western New York. [CLS] [SEP] All three crew members on board died when the aircraft struck the ground following a stall and rapid descent caused by the crew's reaction to erroneous airspeed readings caused by atmospheric icing. [CLS] [SEP] The icing occurred due to failure to turn on the pitot tube heating at the start of the flight. [CLS] [SEP] This was one of two Boeing 727s to crash in the United States that day; the other was TWA Flight 514 in northern Virginia, northwest of Dulles airport. [CLS] [SEP]
