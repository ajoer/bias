The 1933 Treasure Coast hurricane was the second-most intense tropical cyclone to strike the United States during the active 1933 Atlantic hurricane season. [CLS] [SEP] The eleventh tropical storm, fifth hurricane, and the third major hurricane of the season, it formed east-northeast of the Leeward Islands on August 31. [CLS] [SEP] The tropical storm moved rapidly west-northwestward, steadily intensifying to a hurricane. [CLS] [SEP] It acquired peak winds of 140 miles per hour (225 km/h) and passed over portions of the Bahamas on September 3, including Eleuthera and Harbour Island, causing severe damage to crops, buildings, and infrastructure. [CLS] [SEP] Winds over 100 mph (161 km/h) affected many islands in its path, especially those that encountered its center, and many wharves were ruined. [CLS] [SEP] Subsequently, it weakened and made landfall at Jupiter, Florida, early on September 4 with winds of 125 mph (201 km/h). [CLS] [SEP] The hurricane moved across the state, passing near Tampa before moving into Georgia and dissipating. [CLS] [SEP] In Florida, the strong winds of the cyclone blew buildings off their foundations, and numerous trees were prostrated in citrus groves. [CLS] [SEP] The Treasure Coast region received the most extensive destruction, and Stuart, Jupiter, and Fort Pierce were heavily damaged. [CLS] [SEP] Inland, the cyclone weakened rapidly but produced prodigious amounts of rain, causing a dam to collapse near Tampa. [CLS] [SEP] The storm caused $3 million in damage (1933 USD) after damaging or destroying 6,848 homes. [CLS] [SEP] Unusually, the storm hit Florida less than 24 hours before another major hurricane bearing 125-mile-per-hour (201 km/h) winds struck South Texas; never have two major cyclones hit the United States in such close succession.
