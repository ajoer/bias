[SEP] [CLS] Originating from a broad trough that formed on May 14 near Cuba, the early system slowly drifted south of Florida through the Florida Strait for two days, before becoming a depression on May 16 north of The Bahamas, starting the Atlantic season. [SEP] [CLS] A day later, the system would be named Arthur and slowly drift north towards the Outer Banks of North Carolina, before skirting the same area and weakening as it moved towards Bermuda.
