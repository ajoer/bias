In February 1287 a storm hit the southern coast of England with such ferocity that whole areas of coastline were redrawn. [CLS] [SEP] Silting up and cliff collapses led to towns that had stood by the sea finding themselves landlocked, while others that had been inland found themselves with access to the sea. [CLS] [SEP] The city of Winchelsea on Romney Marsh was destroyed (later rebuilt on the cliff top behind). [CLS] [SEP] Nearby Broomhill was also destroyed. [CLS] [SEP] The course of the nearby river Rother was diverted away from New Romney, which was almost destroyed and left a mile from the coast, ending its role as a port. [CLS] [SEP] The Rother ran instead to sea at Rye, prompting its rise as a port. [CLS] [SEP] The storm contributed to the collapse of a cliff at Hastings, taking part of Hastings Castle with it, blocking the harbour and ending its role as a trade centre, though it continued as a centre for fishing. [CLS] [SEP] Whitstable in Kent is also reported to have been hit by the surge. [CLS] [SEP] In all, the storm can be seen to have had a powerful effect on the Cinque Ports, two of which were hit (Hastings and New Romney), along with the supporting "Antient Town" of Winchelsea. [CLS] [SEP] Meanwhile, the other Ancient Town of Rye was advantaged. [CLS] [SEP] The storm is one of two huge ones in England in 1287. [CLS] [SEP] The other was the one known in the Netherlands as St. [CLS] [SEP] Lucia's flood in December, the following winter. [CLS] [SEP] Together with a surge in January 1286, they seem to have prompted the decline of one of England's then leading ports, Dunwich in Suffolk. [CLS] [SEP]
