Hurricane Alice is the only known Atlantic hurricane to span two calendar years and one of only two named Atlantic tropical cyclones, along with Tropical Storm Zeta of 2005, to do so. [CLS] [SEP] The twelfth tropical cyclone and the eighth hurricane of the 1954 Atlantic hurricane season, Alice developed on December 30, 1954 from a trough of low pressure in the central Atlantic Ocean in an area of unusually favorable conditions. [CLS] [SEP] The storm moved southwestward and gradually strengthened to reach hurricane status. [CLS] [SEP] After passing through the Leeward Islands on January 2, 1955, Alice reached peak winds of 90 mph (150 km/h) before encountering cold air and turning to the southeast. [CLS] [SEP] It dissipated on January 6 over the southeastern Caribbean Sea. [CLS] [SEP] Alice produced heavy rainfall and moderately strong winds across several islands along its path. [CLS] [SEP] Saba and Anguilla were affected the most, with total damage amounting to $623,500 (1955 USD). [CLS] [SEP] There was an earlier hurricane named Alice in the season. [CLS] [SEP] Operationally, lack of definitive data prevented the U.S. [CLS] [SEP] Weather Bureau from declaring the system a hurricane until January 2. [CLS] [SEP] It received the name Alice in early 1955, though re-analysis of the data supported extending its track to the previous year, resulting in two tropical cyclones of the same name in one season.
