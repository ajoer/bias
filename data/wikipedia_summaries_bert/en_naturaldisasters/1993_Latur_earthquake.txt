The 1993 Latur earthquake struck India at 3:56 am local time (UTC+05:30) on 30 September. [CLS] [SEP] The main area affected was Maharashtra State in Western India. [CLS] [SEP] The earthquake primarily affected the districts of Latur and Osmanabad, including the Ausa block of Latur and Omerga of Osmanabad. [CLS] [SEP] Fifty-two villages were demolished in the intraplate earthquake. [CLS] [SEP] It measured 6.2 on the moment magnitude scale, and approximately 10,000 people died, whilst another 30,000 were injured. [CLS] [SEP] The earthquake's hypocenter was around 10 km deep – relatively shallow – allowing shock waves to cause more damage. [CLS] [SEP] Because the location does not lie on a plate boundary, there was some debate as to what caused the earthquake. [CLS] [SEP] The Indian sub-continent crumples as it pushes against Asia and pressure is released. [CLS] [SEP] It is possible that this pressure is released along fault lines. [CLS] [SEP] Another argument is that reservoir construction along the Terna was responsible for increasing pressure on fault lines. [CLS] [SEP] Killari, where the epicenter of the quake is believed to have been, had a large crater, which remains in place to date. [CLS] [SEP]
