[CLS] Emery Worldwide Flight 17 was a regularly scheduled domestic cargo flight, flying from Reno to Dayton with an intermediate stopover at Rancho Cordova. [SEP] [CLS] On February 16, 2000, the DC-8 crashed onto an automobile salvage yard shortly after taking off from Sacramento Mather Airport, killing all three crew members on board. [SEP] [CLS] An investigation by the National Transportation Safety Board (NTSB) revealed that during the aircraft's rotation, a control rod to the right elevator control tab detached, causing a loss of pitch control. [SEP] [CLS] The crew attempted unsuccessfully to return to Mather airport. [SEP] [CLS] The NTSB further found that an incorrect maintenance procedure, which was implemented by Emery Worldwide, introduced an incorrect torque-loading on the bolts which were supposed to connect the control rod.Fifteen recommendations were issued by the NTSB. [SEP] [CLS] One of the recommendations was to evaluate every DC-8 on U.S soil to prevent further crashes that could be caused by the disconnection of the right elevator tab. [SEP] [CLS] The Federal Aviation Administration subsequently found more than 100 maintenance violations by the airline, including one that caused another accident on April 26, 2001. [SEP] [CLS] Emery Worldwide later grounded its entire fleet permanently on August 13, 2001. [SEP] [CLS]
