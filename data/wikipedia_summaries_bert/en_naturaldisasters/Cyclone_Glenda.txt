[CLS] Severe Tropical Cyclone Glenda (JTWC designation: 20S, also known as simply Cyclone Glenda) of March 2006 was among the strongest tropical cyclones to threaten Western Australia, though it weakened considerably before landfall and moved ashore in a lightly populated region. [SEP] [CLS] It began as a tropical low on 15 March in the Gulf of Carpentaria. [SEP] [CLS] The precursor disturbance drifted over Top End and later across the northeastern portion of Western Australia, and after emerging into the Indian Ocean it strengthened into a tropical storm. [SEP] [CLS] Aided by favourable environmental conditions, Glenda rapidly intensified to reach Category 5 status on the Australian cyclone scale, and with a peak intensity of 910 mbar it was among the strongest cyclones on record within the Australia region. [SEP] [CLS] On 30 March it moved ashore near Onslow as a Category 3 cyclone, and the next day it degenerated into a remnant tropical low over land. [SEP] [CLS] The precursor disturbance produced heavy rainfall in the Kimberley region of Western Australia, causing record flooding and some road damage. [SEP] [CLS] Minor damage was reported at the final landfall of Glenda. [SEP] [CLS] Due to the sparse population and preparations made, the cyclone was not responsible for any deaths or injuries. [SEP] [CLS] However, its name was later retired from the list of tropical cyclone names. [SEP] [CLS]
