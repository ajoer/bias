Typhoon Rusa was the most powerful typhoon to strike South Korea in 43 years. [CLS] [SEP] It was the 21st JTWC tropical depression, the 15th named storm, and the 10th typhoon of the 2002 Pacific typhoon season. [CLS] [SEP] It developed on August 22 from the monsoon trough in the northwestern Pacific Ocean, well to the southeast of Japan. [CLS] [SEP] For several days, Rusa moved to the northwest, eventually intensifying into a powerful typhoon. [CLS] [SEP] On August 26, the storm moved across the Amami Islands of Japan, where Rusa left 20,000 people without power and caused two fatalities. [CLS] [SEP] Across Japan, the typhoon dropped torrential rainfall peaking at 902 mm (35.5 in) in Tokushima Prefecture. [CLS] [SEP] After weakening slightly, Rusa made landfall on Goheung, South Korea with winds of 140 km/h (85 mph 10 minute sustained). [CLS] [SEP] It was able to maintain much of its intensity due to warm air and instability from a nearby cold front. [CLS] [SEP] Rusa weakened while moving through the country, dropping heavy rainfall that peaked at 897.5 mm (35.33 in) in Gangneung. [CLS] [SEP] A 24-hour total of 880 mm (35 in) in the city broke the record for the highest daily precipitation in the country; however, the heaviest rainfall was localized.
