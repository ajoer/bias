[CLS] Princess Augusta of Saxe-Gotha-Altenburg (30 November [O.S. [SEP] [CLS] 19 November] 1719 â€“ 8 February 1772) was Princess of Wales by marriage to Frederick, Prince of Wales. [SEP] [CLS] She was one of only four Princesses of Wales who never became queen consort, as her eldest son succeeded her father-in-law as George III of the United Kingdom in 1760 rather than her spouse, who had died nine years earlier. [SEP] [CLS] Augusta was presumptive regent of Great Britain in the event of a regency between the death of her spouse in 1751, until the majority of her son in 1756, though in the event her father-in-law, George II, lived until 1760.
