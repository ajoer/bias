A nor'easter (also northeaster; see below) is a macro-scale extratropical cyclone in the western North Atlantic Ocean. [CLS] [SEP] The name derives from the direction of the winds that blow from the northeast. [CLS] [SEP] The original use of the term in North America is associated with storms that impact the upper north Atlantic coast of the United States and the Atlantic Provinces of Canada. [CLS] [SEP] Typically, such storms originate as a low-pressure area that forms within 100 miles (160 km) of the shore between North Carolina and Massachusetts. [CLS] [SEP] The precipitation pattern is similar to that of other extratropical storms. [CLS] [SEP] Nor'easters are usually accompanied by very heavy rain or snow, and can cause severe coastal flooding, coastal erosion, hurricane-force winds, or blizzard conditions. [CLS] [SEP] Nor'easters are usually most intense during winter in New England and Atlantic Canada. [CLS] [SEP] They thrive on converging air masses—the cold polar air mass and the warmer air over the water—and are more severe in winter when the difference in temperature between these air masses is greater.Nor'easters tend to develop most often and most powerfully between the months of November and March, although they can (much less commonly) develop during other parts of the year as well. [CLS] [SEP] The susceptible regions are generally impacted by nor'easters a few times each winter. [CLS] [SEP]
