The 1909 Monterrey hurricane was one of the deadliest Atlantic tropical cyclones on record, killing an estimated 4,000 people throughout Mexico. [CLS] [SEP] Originating from a tropical storm east of the Leeward Islands on August 20, the storm tracked west-northwest, entering the Caribbean Sea as a minimal hurricane the next day. [CLS] [SEP] After striking Hispaniola on August 23, the hurricane made another landfall in eastern Cuba before reentering the Caribbean. [CLS] [SEP] Once back over open water, the storm intensified into a Category 3 hurricane and moved across the northern tip of the Yucat√°n Peninsula. [CLS] [SEP] By August 26, the storm had emerged into the Gulf of Mexico as a weakened, but regrouping system. [CLS] [SEP] It attained its peak winds of 120 mph (185 km/h) that evening. [CLS] [SEP] Maintaining this intensity, the system made landfall in the Mexican state of Tamaulipas late on August 27 and rapidly dissipated the following afternoon. [CLS] [SEP] Throughout its existence, the hurricane remained relatively close to land, so consequently its effects were felt in many areas. [CLS] [SEP] Much of the northern Caribbean received moderate to heavy rainfall along with gusty winds during its passage; although only Haiti reported damage from it. [CLS] [SEP] Its effects were far more severe in Mexico where an estimated 4,000 people were killed by record-breaking floods triggered by the hurricane. [CLS] [SEP] The city of Monterrey received the worst damage: more than half of the structures in the city were flooded, hundreds were destroyed, and 20,000 people were left homeless. [CLS] [SEP] Damage from the storm in the country was estimated to have exceeded $50 million (1909 USD; $1.42 billion 2020 USD). [CLS] [SEP]
