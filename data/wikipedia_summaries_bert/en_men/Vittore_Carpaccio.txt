[CLS] Vittore Carpaccio (UK: , US: , Italian: [vitˈtoːre karˈpattʃo]; c. [SEP] [CLS] 1465 – 1525/1526) was an Italian painter of the Venetian school, who studied under Gentile Bellini. [SEP] [CLS] He is best known for a cycle of nine paintings, The Legend of Saint Ursula. [SEP] [CLS] His style was somewhat conservative, showing little influence from the Humanist trends that transformed Italian Renaissance painting during his lifetime. [SEP] [CLS] He was influenced by the style of Antonello da Messina and Early Netherlandish art. [SEP] [CLS] For this reason, and also because so much of his best work remains in Venice, his art has been rather neglected by comparison with other Venetian contemporaries, such as Giovanni Bellini or Giorgione.
