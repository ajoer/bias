[CLS] Masaccio (UK: , US: , Italian: [maˈzattʃo]; December 21, 1401 – summer 1428), born Tommaso di Ser Giovanni di Simone, was a Florentine artist who is regarded as the first great Italian painter of the Quattrocento period of the Italian Renaissance. [SEP] [CLS] According to Vasari, Masaccio was the best painter of his generation because of his skill at imitating nature, recreating lifelike figures and movements as well as a convincing sense of three-dimensionality. [SEP] [CLS] He employed nudes and foreshortenings in his figures. [SEP] [CLS] This had seldom been done before him.The name Masaccio is a humorous version of Maso (short for Tommaso), meaning "clumsy" or "messy" Tom. [SEP] [CLS] The name may have been created to distinguish him from his principal collaborator, also called Maso, who came to be known as Masolino ("little/delicate Tom"). [SEP] [CLS] Despite his brief career, he had a profound influence on other artists and is considered to have started the Early Italian Renaissance in painting with his works in the mid- and late-1420s. [SEP] [CLS] He was one of the first to use linear perspective in his painting, employing techniques such as vanishing point in art for the first time. [SEP] [CLS] He moved away from the International Gothic style and elaborate ornamentation of artists like Gentile da Fabriano to a more naturalistic mode that employed perspective and chiaroscuro for greater realism. [SEP] [CLS] Masaccio died at the age of twenty-six and little is known about the exact circumstances of his death. [SEP] [CLS] Upon hearing of Masaccio’s death, Filippo Brunelleschi said: "We have suffered a great loss."
