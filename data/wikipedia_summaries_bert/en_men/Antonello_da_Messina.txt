Antonello da Messina, properly Antonello di Giovanni di Antonio, but also called Antonello degli Antoni and Anglicized as Anthony of Messina (c. [CLS] [SEP] 1430 â€“ February 1479), was a Sicilian painter from Messina, active during the Early Italian Renaissance. [CLS] [SEP] His work shows strong influences from Early Netherlandish painting although there is no documentary evidence that he ever travelled beyond Italy. [CLS] [SEP] Giorgio Vasari credited him with the introduction of oil painting into Italy.
