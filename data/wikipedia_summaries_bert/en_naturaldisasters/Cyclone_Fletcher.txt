[CLS] Tropical Low Fletcher was a weak system that produced torrential rains over parts of Queensland, Australia in February 2014. [SEP] [CLS] Originating as tropical low over the Timor Sea on 30 January, Fletcher quickly became an organised system as it moved over the Top End region of the Northern Territory. [SEP] [CLS] Once over the Gulf of Carpentaria on 2 February, deep convection formed near its center and the following day it became a tropical cyclone. [SEP] [CLS] With peak winds estimated at 65 km/h (40 mph), the storm made landfall in Queensland before weakening to a low. [SEP] [CLS] Over the following week, the system's movement became slow and erratic. [SEP] [CLS] Executing three loops, the former cyclone meandered over the southeastern Gulf of Carpentaria before accelerating southwest and later west. [SEP] [CLS] Fletcher was last noted on 12 February over the Alice Springs District in the Northern Territory. [SEP] [CLS]
