The 1902 eruption of Mount Pelée was a moderately large volcanic eruption on the island of Martinique in the Lesser Antilles Volcanic Arc of the eastern Caribbean. [CLS] [SEP] Eruptive activity began on 23 April as a series of phreatic explosions from the summit of Mount Pelée. [CLS] [SEP] Within days, the vigor of the explosions exceeded anything witnessed since the island was settled by Europeans. [CLS] [SEP] The intensity then subsided for a few days until early May when the explosions had increased again. [CLS] [SEP] Lightning laced the eruption clouds and trade winds dumped ash on villages to the west. [CLS] [SEP] Heavy ash fall at times caused total darkness. [CLS] [SEP] Some of the afflicted residents panicked and headed for the perceived safety of larger settlements, especially Saint-Pierre, about 10 km (6.2 mi) south of Pelée's summit. [CLS] [SEP] Saint-Pierre received its first ash fall on 3 May.Mount Pelée remained relatively quiet until the afternoon of 5 May when a mudflow swept down a river on the southwest flank of the volcano, destroying a sugar mill. [CLS] [SEP] The massive flow buried about 150 people and generated a series of three tsunamis as it hit the sea. [CLS] [SEP] The tsunamis swept along the coast, damaging buildings and boats. [CLS] [SEP] The explosions resumed the night of 5 May. [CLS] [SEP] The following morning, parts of the eruption plume became incandescent, signifying that the character of the eruption had changed. [CLS] [SEP] The phreatic explosions had finally given way to magmatic explosions as magma reached the surface. [CLS] [SEP] The explosions continued through the next day and night.A brief lull was shattered by a tremendous explosion at about 8:00 a.m. [CLS] [SEP] on 8 May. [CLS] [SEP] A ground-hugging cloud of incandescent lava particles suspended by searing turbulent gases moved at hurricane speed down the southwest flank of the volcano, reaching Saint-Pierre at 8:02 a.m. [CLS] [SEP] Escape from the city was virtually impossible. [CLS] [SEP] Almost everyone within the city proper—about 28,000 people—died horrifically, burned or buried by falling masonry. [CLS] [SEP] The hot ash ignited a firestorm, fueled by smashed buildings and countless casks of rum. [CLS] [SEP] Only two survived within the city, along with a few tens of people caught within the margins of the cloud. [CLS] [SEP] All survivors were badly burned.Explosive activity on 20 May resulted in another 2,000 deaths as rescuers, engineers and mariners brought supplies to the island. [CLS] [SEP] A powerful eruption on 30 August generated a pyroclastic flow that resulted in over 800 people killed. [CLS] [SEP] The eruption continued until October 1905. [CLS] [SEP]
