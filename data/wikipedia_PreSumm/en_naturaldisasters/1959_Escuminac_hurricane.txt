[CLS] The 1959 Escuminac disaster (also to referred to as the Escuminac hurricane) was considered the worst fishing-related disaster in New Brunswick in 100 years. [SEP] [CLS] It occurred due to the extratropical remnants of an Atlantic hurricane. [SEP] [CLS] The storm was the third tropical cyclone and first hurricane of the 1959 Atlantic hurricane season, and developed from a tropical wave in the central Gulf of Mexico on June 18. [SEP] [CLS] It headed rapidly northeastward and struck Florida later that day. [SEP] [CLS] Shortly after entering the Atlantic Ocean, it strengthened into a tropical storm later on June 18. [SEP] [CLS] By the following day, it had strengthened into a hurricane. [SEP] [CLS] However, it transitioned into an extratropical cyclone about six hours later. [SEP] [CLS] The remnants struck Atlantic Canada, once in Nova Scotia and again in Newfoundland before dissipating on June 21. [SEP] [CLS] In its early stages, the storm dropped moderately heavy rainfall in Florida, which caused damage to crops. [SEP] [CLS] A tornado near Miami and high tides on the west coast of the state also resulted in damage. [SEP] [CLS] Overall, losses in Florida were around $1.7 million (1959 USD). [SEP] [CLS] After becoming extratropical, the storm caused significant effects in Atlantic Canada. [SEP] [CLS] About 45 boats were in the Northumberland Strait between New Brunswick and Prince Edward Island, and they did not have radio to receive warning of the approaching storm. [SEP] [CLS] Rough seas of up to 49 ft (15 m) in height damaged or destroyed many boats. [SEP] [CLS] At least 22 fishing boats capsized with their crews, causing 35 fatalities. [SEP] [CLS] High winds also disrupted communications in some areas, and several houses were damaged, causing damage costing $750,000 (1959 CAD, $781,000 1959 USD). [SEP] [CLS] The event became the deadliest work-related disaster in New Brunswick. [SEP] [CLS]
