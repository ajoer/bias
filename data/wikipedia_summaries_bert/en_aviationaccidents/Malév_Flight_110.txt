At about 11:45 A.M. [CLS] [SEP] on September 16, 1971, Mal√©v Flight 110 crashed near Kiev-Borispol Airport. [CLS] [SEP] It was making its approach, but there was poor visibility; due to heavy fog and poor weather conditions, it was limited to 1800 meters. [CLS] [SEP] To worsen the situation, the plane's generator had failed, forcing the crew to switch to the battery's auxiliary power. [CLS] [SEP] But due to the poor visibility, the crew was forced to make two landing attempts, both of which failed. [CLS] [SEP] As they tried to land, the visibility significantly decreased to about 700 meters. [CLS] [SEP] Usually, in the event of emergency, the equipment necessary to control the airplane could operate using batteries for at least sixty minutes when staff shut down excessive consumers such as refrigerators, kitchen heaters, or cabin lighting in time. [CLS] [SEP] This did not happen, so battery life decreased by half. [CLS] [SEP] The plane eventually ran out of battery power and crashed several kilometers away from the airport. [CLS] [SEP] The plane broke up and all 49 people on board perished. [CLS] [SEP] After an investigation, officials determined that the crash was caused by an unfortunate series of events involving pilot error, mismanagement of the situation by the ground crew, aircraft malfunctions, and poor conditions.
