Cyclone Bola was one of the costliest cyclones in the history of New Zealand, causing severe damage as an extratropical cyclone when it passed near the country in March 1988. [CLS] [SEP] It formed on February 24 to the north of Fiji, and tracking generally southwestward it reached hurricane-force winds near Vanuatu on February 28. [CLS] [SEP] The next day it generated peak wind velocities of 195 km/h (120 mph), though it quickly weakened as it accelerated southward. [CLS] [SEP] On March 4, Bola transitioned into an extratropical storm, passing to the north of the North Island of New Zealand on March 8. [CLS] [SEP] It weakened further and was absorbed by a stationary trough near the South Island on March 12. [CLS] [SEP] The cyclone first affected Fiji, where it produced gale-force winds and strong waves. [CLS] [SEP] In Vanuatu, Bola dropped heavy rainfall, which destroyed two bridges and caused severe damage to islands in the group. [CLS] [SEP] Bola caused severe damage to the North Island of New Zealand, where heavy rainfall peaked at 917 mm (36.1 in) in Gisborne Region. [CLS] [SEP] Damage totaled over $82 million (1988 USD). [CLS] [SEP] Three people were killed due to flooding, and hundreds were evacuated when a swollen river threatened Wairoa. [CLS] [SEP] In Whangaruru Harbour, Northland, a samaritan act accounted for another Bola fatality when an elderly male long time resident of Rapata road Oakura Bay attempted to tie down a neighbours empty water tank. [CLS] [SEP] He suffered a massive heart attack and died during the peak of the storm. [CLS] [SEP] The name Bola was later retired, meaning it will not be used again within the same basin.
