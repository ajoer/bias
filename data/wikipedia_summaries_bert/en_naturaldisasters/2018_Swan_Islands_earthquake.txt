On 9 January 2018, at approximately 8:51 p.m. [CLS] [SEP] local time (02:51 10 January UTC), a magnitude 7.5 earthquake struck in the Yucat√°n Basin of the Caribbean Sea, 44 kilometres (27 mi) east of Great Swan Island off the coast of Honduras. [CLS] [SEP] The earthquake was felt across Central America, and rattled windows in Tegucigalpa. [CLS] [SEP] The earthquake was also felt in the Cayman Islands. [CLS] [SEP] Tsunami advisories were issued for certain areas by the U.S. [CLS] [SEP] Tsunami Warning Center. [CLS] [SEP] They were later cancelled after further monitoring. [CLS] [SEP] No tsunami was generated since the earthquake was an almost pure strike-slip on a near vertical plane, producing little upward movement of the sea floor that would cause a large displacement of water.
