[CLS] Capital Airlines Flight 20 was a U.S. [SEP] [CLS] scheduled passenger flight from Washington, D.C. [SEP] [CLS] to Norfolk, Virginia. [SEP] [CLS] A Vickers Viscount flying the route crashed into a farm in Charles City County, Virginia, on January 18, 1960. [SEP] [CLS] The accident was the fourth fatal crash involving a Capital Viscount in less than two years; the first three were Capital Airlines Flight 67 (April 1958), Capital Airlines Flight 300 (May 1958) and Capital Airlines Flight 75 (May 1959). [SEP] [CLS] The plane was cruising at an altitude of 8,000 feet when it encountered icing. [SEP] [CLS] This caused two engines to fail. [SEP] [CLS] As the craft descended, the other two engines also failed, causing the propellers to autofeather. [SEP] [CLS] The crew tried and failed to restart the engines, and were unable to unfeather the propellers normally; they then put the plane into a dive in an attempt to force the propellers from their feathered position. [SEP] [CLS] Eventually they succeeded in restarting engine number four. [SEP] [CLS] They applied full power to this engine, which caused the craft to enter a circling descent until crashing into trees; at the time of impact it had almost no forward velocity. [SEP] [CLS] Five trees were driven through the fuselage, yet their trunks remained intact. [SEP] [CLS] The plane burned for hours after the crash, the police said at the time. [SEP] [CLS] They also indicated that they had not been able to approach it to make an effort at recovering bodies. [SEP] [CLS] In addition, treacherous underfooting made the use of firefighting equipment almost impossible. [SEP] [CLS] Heavy fog had closed many airports throughout eastern Virginia and had blanketed the area when the plane bearing 44 passengers and a crew of four came down on swampland near Sandy Gut, a tributary of the Chickahominy River about 30 miles southeast of Richmond. [SEP] [CLS] The plane was flying from Chicago to Norfolk - where the airport was open - by way of Washington. [SEP] [CLS] It had left Washington at 9:40 p.m. [SEP] [CLS] and crashed at 11 p.m. [SEP] [CLS] Capital Airlines in Washington identified the jet-prop aircraft's crew as Capt. [SEP] [CLS] James B. [SEP] [CLS] Fornasero, pilot; Philip Henry Cullom, first officer; and two hostesses, Diane Margaret O'Donnell and Brigitte Friede Helene Jordt. [SEP] [CLS] The crash was attributed to the fact that, as per airline policy, the pilots had delayed arming the engine ice protection systems even though they were flying in icy conditions; this caused the engines to lose too much power. [SEP] [CLS] Capital Airlines changed its emergency checklist after the crash, deleting the instruction that pilots were to descend to a warmer climate to relight the systems and instructing them that, provided that correct procedure was followed, the engine could be restarted at any height.
