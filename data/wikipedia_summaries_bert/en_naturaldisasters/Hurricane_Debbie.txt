[CLS] Hurricane Debbie was a moderate tropical cyclone which had significant impacts in Ireland as an extratropical cyclone. [SEP] [CLS] The fourth named storm of the 1961 Atlantic hurricane season, Debbie originated from a well-defined tropical disturbance that was first identified in late August over Central Africa. [SEP] [CLS] Tracking generally westward, the system moved off the coast of Senegal on September 5 into the Atlantic Ocean. [SEP] [CLS] By this time, it was estimated to have become a tropical depression, but forecasters did not issue advisories on the system until two days later. [SEP] [CLS] Late on September 6, Debbie passed through the southern Cape Verde Islands as a moderate tropical storm, resulting in a plane crash that killed 60 people in the islands. [SEP] [CLS] Once clear of the islands, data on the storm became sparse, and the status of Debbie was uncertain over the following several days as it tracked west-northwestward and later northward. [SEP] [CLS] It was not until a commercial airliner intercepted the storm on September 10 that its location became certain. [SEP] [CLS] The following day, Debbie intensified and reached its peak intensity as a Category 1 hurricane on the Saffir–Simpson hurricane scale, with maximum winds of 90 mph (150 km/h). [SEP] [CLS] Maintaining its peak intensity for almost a day, the hurricane gradually slowed its forward motion and weakened. [SEP] [CLS] By September 13, Debbie's motion became influenced by the Westerlies, causing the system to accelerate east-northeastward. [SEP] [CLS] The system passed over the western Azores as an extratropical cyclone bearing hurricane-force winds on September 15. [SEP] [CLS] The system subsequently deepened as it neared Ireland, skirting the coast of Western Ireland on September 16. [SEP] [CLS] The remnants of the storm later weakened and turned eastward, striking Norway and Russia, before dissipating on September 19. [SEP] [CLS] Striking Ireland as a powerful storm, the remnants of Debbie brought record winds to much of the island, with a peak gust of 114 mph (183 km/h) measured just offshore. [SEP] [CLS] These winds caused widespread damage and disruption, downing tens of thousands of trees and power lines. [SEP] [CLS] Countless structures sustained varying degrees of damage, with many smaller buildings destroyed. [SEP] [CLS] Agriculture experienced extensive losses to barley, corn and wheat crops. [SEP] [CLS] Throughout Ireland, Debbie killed 18 people (12 in the Republic of Ireland and six in Northern Ireland). [SEP] [CLS] It caused US$40–50 million in damage in the Republic and at least £1.5 million (US$4 million) in Northern Ireland. [SEP] [CLS] The storm also battered parts of Great Britain with winds in excess of 100 mph (160 km/h). [SEP] [CLS]
