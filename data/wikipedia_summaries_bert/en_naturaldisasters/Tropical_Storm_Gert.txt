Tropical Storm Gert was the fourth of seven tropical cyclones (4 hurricanes, two major hurricanes, and four tropical storms) to make landfall in Mexico during 2005. [CLS] [SEP] It formed in July in the Bay of Campeche, becoming the seventh named storm of the 2005 Atlantic hurricane season. [CLS] [SEP] As a tropical wave, Gert crossed Honduras and the Yucatán peninsula before organizing into Tropical Depression Seven on the afternoon of July 23 in the Bay of Campeche. [CLS] [SEP] It was upgraded to Tropical Storm Gert early the next day, gaining the record for the earliest formation of a seventh named storm in an Atlantic hurricane season. [CLS] [SEP] That record would later be broken by Tropical Storm Gonzalo in 2020. [CLS] [SEP] Gert strengthened little before making landfall south of Tampico, Tamaulipas, late on July 24, with maximum sustained winds of 45 mph (70 km/h) and a minimum central pressure of 1005 mbar (29.68 inHg). [CLS] [SEP] It moved inland over central Mexico before dissipating on the next day. [CLS] [SEP] Gert struck in approximately the same area as Hurricane Emily just four days earlier, causing fear of flooding and landslides due to saturated lands. [CLS] [SEP] As a precaution, some 1,000 people were evacuated from low-lying residences and businesses near the towns of Naranjos Amatlán and Tamiahua. [CLS] [SEP]
