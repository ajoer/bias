On April 29, 1892, a powerful tropical cyclone struck the island of Mauritius in the South-West Indian Ocean. [CLS] [SEP] At least 1,200 people died during the storm, and another 4,000 people were injured, with 50,000 people left homeless, making the cyclone the second-deadliest tropical cyclone recorded in the South-West Indian Ocean basin, behind Cyclone Idai in 2019. [CLS] [SEP] It is also the third-deadliest recorded in the Southern Hemisphere, behind the aforementioned Cyclone Idai and the 1973 Flores cyclone. [CLS] [SEP] The storm originated north of the island, and local meteorologists expected that the storm would remain away from the island. [CLS] [SEP] Consequentially, residents were unprepared until the arrival of the strong winds. [CLS] [SEP] For a span of 65 minutes, the calm of the storm's eye occurred on the island, before the winds again increased, reaching 195 km/h (121 mph), with gusts to 216 km/h (134 mph). [CLS] [SEP] During the storm, the barometric pressure dropped to 947 mbar (27.96 inHg), breaking the 74-year-old record for the lowest recorded pressure on the island. [CLS] [SEP] The damage on Mauritius was so severe that contemporaneous newspapers questioned whether the island would recover. [CLS] [SEP] Damage was estimated at Â£2,000,000 (1892 GBP, $9.75 million USD). [CLS] [SEP]
