[CLS] Severe Tropical Cyclone Tino was a tropical cyclone which itself and an associated convergence zone caused significant damage across 10 island nations in the South Pacific Ocean during January 2020. [SEP] [CLS] First noted as a tropical disturbance during January 11, to the southwest of Honiara in the Solomon Islands, the system gradually developed over the next few days as it moved eastwards in between the Solomon Islands and Vanuatu prior to being named Tino as it approached Fiji during January 16. [SEP] [CLS] Continuing to track south-eastward, Tino continued strengthening as it passed near Fiji, bringing copious amounts of rainfall to the area. [SEP] [CLS] Whilst losing latitude, the system continued to strengthen and peaked as a category 3 tropical cyclone on January 17, with signs of an eye forming. [SEP] [CLS] Shortly after peak intensity, Tino was impacted by high wind shear and decreasing sea surface temperatures, triggering a weakening trend. [SEP] [CLS] Tino moved out of the tropics shortly thereafter and became an extratropical cyclone during January 19. [SEP] [CLS] In its formative stages, Tino produced heavy rainfall over the Solomon Islands and Vanuatu. [SEP] [CLS] Wallis and Futuna sustained similar effects, particularly in Wallis where damaged homes and downed trees were reported. [SEP] [CLS] Fiji and the Fijian dependency of Rotuma were extensively impacted by the cyclone. [SEP] [CLS] Rotuma's wharf in Oinafa was severely damaged, curtailing marine travel. [SEP] [CLS] More than 3,000 people sought shelter in Fiji ahead of the storm. [SEP] [CLS] The Northern Division was most greatly affected, incurring a US$2.81 million damage toll. [SEP] [CLS] Flooding rainfall caused creeks to overflow and thousands were left without power. [SEP] [CLS] Two people were missing after being swept by a swollen creek in Serua Province. [SEP] [CLS] Roads and crops were damaged in Tonga following Tino's passage on January 18 near peak strength, with the worst effects afflicting the island groups of Vava ªu and Ha'apai. [SEP] [CLS] A convergence zone connected to Tino brought stormy conditions well-spatially and temporally beyond the cyclone's circulation. [SEP] [CLS] Waves as high as 8 m (26 ft) struck Tuvalu's low-lying atolls and surrounding waters, causing catastrophic flooding and uprooting numerous crops. [SEP] [CLS] The convergence zone also produced damaging swells in Niue and gusty winds in Samoa. [SEP] [CLS]
