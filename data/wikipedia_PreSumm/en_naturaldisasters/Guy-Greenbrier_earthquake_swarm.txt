[CLS] An earthquake swarm is a sequence of seismic events occurring in a local area within a relatively short period of time. [SEP] [CLS] The length of time used to define the swarm itself varies, but may be of the order of days, months, or even years. [SEP] [CLS] Such an energy release is different from what happens commonly when a major earthquake (mainshock) is followed by a series of aftershocks: in earthquake swarms, no single earthquake in the sequence is obviously the mainshock. [SEP] [CLS] In particular, a cluster of aftershocks occurring after a mainshock is not a swarm. [SEP] [CLS]
