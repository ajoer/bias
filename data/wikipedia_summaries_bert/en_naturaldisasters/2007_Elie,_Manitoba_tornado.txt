The Elie, Manitoba tornado was an extremely powerful F5 tornado that struck the town of Elie, in the Canadian province of Manitoba (40 kilometres (25 miles) west of Winnipeg), on the evening of Friday, June 22, 2007. [CLS] [SEP] While several houses were leveled, no one was injured or killed by the tornado. [CLS] [SEP] A home in the town was swept clean off of its foundation, justifying the F5 classification. [CLS] [SEP] This makes it one of the strongest twisters on record since 1999 and one of only nine to reach F5/EF5 intensity between 1999 and 2011 in North America. [CLS] [SEP] This tornado was part of a two-day outbreak of severe weather through June 23, including at least four other tornadoes confirmed in Manitoba and Saskatchewan. [CLS] [SEP] Because Environment Canada adopted the Enhanced Fujita scale in 2013, there will be no more tornadoes with an F5 rating, making this tornado the first and last confirmed F5 tornado in Canada.
