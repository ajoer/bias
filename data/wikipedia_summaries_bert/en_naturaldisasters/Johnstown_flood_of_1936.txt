The Johnstown flood of 1936, also collectively with other areas referred to as the Saint Patrick's Day Flood, was a devastating flood in Cambria County, and Johnstown, Pennsylvania proper, referred to as "Greater Johnstown". [CLS] [SEP] The flood was preceded by heavy rains beginning March 9, 1936, which did not stop until March 22. [CLS] [SEP] The storms brought warmer weather with temperatures of 50 °F (10 °C) and was a cause of one stage of the flooding; the continuous rainfall was the second cause. [CLS] [SEP] The natural surface runoff of 1 to 3 inches (2.5 to 7.5 cm) was far surpassed by the deluge of from 10 to 30 inches (25 to 75 cm) of water in the region.
