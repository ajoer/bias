[CLS] Hurricane Iwa, taken from the Hawaiian language name for the frigatebird (ʻiwa, lit. [SEP] [CLS] "Thief"), was at the time the costliest hurricane to affect the state of Hawaiʻi. [SEP] [CLS] Iwa was the twenty-third tropical storm and the twelfth and final hurricane of the 1982 Pacific hurricane season. [SEP] [CLS] It developed from an active trough of low pressure near the equator on November 19. [SEP] [CLS] The storm moved erratically northward until becoming a hurricane on November 23 when it began accelerating to the northeast in response to strong upper-level flow from the north. [SEP] [CLS] Iwa passed within 25 miles of the island of Kauaʻi with peak winds of 90 mph (145 km/h) on November 23 (November 24 Coordinated Universal Time), and the next day it became extratropical to the northeast of the state. [SEP] [CLS] The hurricane devastated the islands of Niʻihau, Kauaʻi, and Oʻahu with wind gusts exceeding 100 mph (160 km/h) and rough seas exceeding 30 feet (9 m) in height. [SEP] [CLS] The first significant hurricane to hit the Hawaiian Islands since statehood in 1959, Iwa severely damaged or destroyed 2,345 buildings, including 1,927 houses, leaving 500 people homeless. [SEP] [CLS] Damage throughout the state totaled $312 million (1982 USD, $827 million 2020 USD). [SEP] [CLS] One person was killed from the high seas, and three deaths were indirectly related to the hurricane's aftermath. [SEP] [CLS]
