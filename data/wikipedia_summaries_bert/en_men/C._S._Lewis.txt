[CLS] Clive Staples Lewis (29 November 1898 – 22 November 1963) was a British writer and lay theologian. [SEP] [CLS] He held academic positions in English literature at both Oxford University (Magdalen College, 1925–1954) and Cambridge University (Magdalene College, 1954–1963). [SEP] [CLS] He is best known for his works of fiction, especially The Screwtape Letters, The Chronicles of Narnia, and The Space Trilogy, and for his non-fiction Christian apologetics, such as Mere Christianity, Miracles, and The Problem of Pain. [SEP] [CLS] Lewis and fellow novelist J. [SEP] [CLS] R. [SEP] [CLS] R. [SEP] [CLS] Tolkien were close friends. [SEP] [CLS] They both served on the English faculty at Oxford University and were active in the informal Oxford literary group known as the Inklings. [SEP] [CLS] According to Lewis's 1955 memoir Surprised by Joy, he was baptised in the Church of Ireland, but fell away from his faith during adolescence. [SEP] [CLS] Lewis returned to Anglicanism at the age of 32, owing to the influence of Tolkien and other friends, and he became an "ordinary layman of the Church of England". [SEP] [CLS] Lewis's faith profoundly affected his work, and his wartime radio broadcasts on the subject of Christianity brought him wide acclaim. [SEP] [CLS] Lewis wrote more than 30 books which have been translated into more than 30 languages and have sold millions of copies. [SEP] [CLS] The books that make up The Chronicles of Narnia have sold the most and have been popularised on stage, TV, radio, and cinema. [SEP] [CLS] His philosophical writings are widely cited by Christian apologists from many denominations. [SEP] [CLS] In 1956, Lewis married American writer Joy Davidman; she died of cancer four years later at the age of 45. [SEP] [CLS] Lewis died on 22 November 1963 from kidney failure, one week before his 65th birthday. [SEP] [CLS] In 2013, on the 50th anniversary of his death, Lewis was honoured with a memorial in Poets' Corner in Westminster Abbey. [SEP] [CLS]
