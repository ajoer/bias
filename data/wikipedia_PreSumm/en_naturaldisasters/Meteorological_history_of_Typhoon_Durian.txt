[CLS] Typhoon Durian's meteorological history began with its origins as a tropical disturbance near Chuuk State on November 23, 2006, and lasted until its dissipation off the coast of Andhra Pradesh, India, on December 9. [SEP] [CLS] Durian formed as a tropical depression on November 25 near Chuuk State. [SEP] [CLS] Situated south of a ridge, the system tracked west-northwest over a region characterized by low wind shear and good upper-level divergence. [SEP] [CLS] Late on November 26, the depression intensified into a tropical storm and was named Durian. [SEP] [CLS] Steady strengthening took place over the following two days as the system approached the Philippines. [SEP] [CLS] After attaining typhoon status on November 29, Durian underwent a period of rapid intensification, culminating with it attaining peak winds of 195 km/h (120 mph) and a barometric pressure of 915 mbar (hPa; 27.02 inHg). [SEP] [CLS] Durian brushed the southern coast of the Catanduanes at this intensity, where a record gust of 320 km/h (200 mph) was observed. [SEP] [CLS] Slight weakening took place before the storm made landfall in the Bicol Region. [SEP] [CLS] Land interaction precipitated further degradation of storm, though it retained typhoon status upon emerging over the South China Sea on December 1. [SEP] [CLS] Some re-intensification occurred, with Durian reaching a secondary peak on December 3. [SEP] [CLS] Subsequently, increasingly hostile conditions caused the system to weaken to a tropical storm as it turned southwest. [SEP] [CLS] Durian struck southern Vietnam early on December 5 as a tropical storm before diminishing to a tropical depression. [SEP] [CLS] The system turned westward once again and crossed Malay Peninsula. [SEP] [CLS] Failing to reorganize, Durian degenerated into a remnant low on December 7 before ultimately dissipating two days later off the coast of Andhra Pradesh, India. [SEP] [CLS]
