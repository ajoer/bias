Volapük ( in English; [volaˈpyk] in Volapük) is a constructed language created in 1879 and 1880 by Johann Martin Schleyer, a Roman Catholic priest in Baden, Germany. [CLS] [SEP] Schleyer felt that God had told him in a dream to create an international language. [CLS] [SEP] Volapük conventions took place in 1884 (Friedrichshafen), 1887 (Munich) and 1889 (Paris). [CLS] [SEP] The first two conventions used German, and the last conference used only Volapük. [CLS] [SEP] In 1889, there were an estimated 283 clubs, 25 periodicals in or about Volapük, and 316 textbooks in 25 languages; at that time the language claimed nearly a million adherents. [CLS] [SEP] Volapük was largely displaced in the late 19th and early 20th centuries by Esperanto. [CLS] [SEP]
