[SEP] [CLS] She was concurrently Empress of India. [SEP] [CLS] Although technically a princess of Teck, in the Kingdom of Württemberg, she was born and raised in the United Kingdom. [SEP] [CLS] Her parents were Francis, Duke of Teck, who was of German extraction, and Princess Mary Adelaide of Cambridge, who was a granddaughter of King George III. [SEP] [CLS] She was informally known as "May", after her birth month.
