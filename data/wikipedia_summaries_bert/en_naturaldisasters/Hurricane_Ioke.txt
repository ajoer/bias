[CLS] Hurricane Ioke, also referred to as Typhoon Ioke, had the highest Accumulated cyclone energy (ACE) of any tropical cyclone on record. [SEP] [CLS] The first storm to form in the Central Pacific in the 2006 Pacific hurricane season, Ioke was a record breaking, long-lived and extremely powerful storm that traversed the Pacific for 17 days, reaching the equivalent of Category 5 status on the Saffirâ€“Simpson hurricane scale on three different occasions. [SEP] [CLS] It was the most intense hurricane ever recorded in the Central Pacific, as well as the fifth-most intense Pacific hurricane on record, tied with 1973's Hurricane Ava. [SEP] [CLS] The cyclone developed in the Intertropical Convergence Zone on August 20 far to the south of Hawaii. [SEP] [CLS] Encountering warm waters, little wind shear, and well-defined outflow, Ioke intensified from a tropical depression to Category 4 status within 48 hours. [SEP] [CLS] Late on August 22 it rapidly weakened to Category 2 status before crossing over Johnston Atoll. [SEP] [CLS] Two days later favorable conditions again allowed for rapid strengthening, and Ioke attained Category 5 status on August 25 before crossing the International Date Line. [SEP] [CLS] As it continued westward its intensity fluctuated, and on August 31 it passed near Wake Island with winds of 155 mph (250 km/h). [SEP] [CLS] Ioke gradually weakened as it turned northwestward and northward, and by September 6 it had transitioned into an extratropical cyclone. [SEP] [CLS] The remnants of Ioke accelerated northeastward and ultimately crossed into the Bering Sea, and then the Gulf of Alaska. [SEP] [CLS] Ioke did not affect any permanently-populated areas in the Central Pacific or Western Pacific basins as a hurricane or a typhoon. [SEP] [CLS] A crew of 12 people rode out the hurricane in a hurricane-proof bunker on Johnston Atoll; the crew estimated winds reached over 100 mph (160 km/h), which damaged trees on the island but did not impact the island's bird population. [SEP] [CLS] The typhoon left moderate damage on Wake Island totaling $88 million (2006 USD, equivalent to $110 million in 2018), including blown off roofs and damaged buildings, though the infrastructure of the island was left intact; all military personnel were evacuated from the island. [SEP] [CLS] Later, the extratropical remnants of Ioke produced a severe storm surge along the Alaskan coastline, causing beach erosion. [SEP] [CLS]
