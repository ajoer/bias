Luise Rainer (, German: [ˈʁaɪ̯nɐ]; 12 January 1910 – 30 December 2014) was a German-American-British film actress. [CLS] [SEP] She was the first thespian to win multiple Academy Awards and the first to win back-to-back; at the time of her death, thirteen days shy of her 105th birthday, she was the longest-lived Oscar recipient, a superlative that had not been exceeded as of 2020.Rainer started her acting career in Germany at age 16, under the tutelage of Austria's leading stage director, Max Reinhardt. [CLS] [SEP] Within a few years, she had become a distinguished Berlin stage actress with Reinhardt's Vienna theater ensemble. [CLS] [SEP] Critics highly praised the quality of her acting. [CLS] [SEP] After years of acting on stage and in films in Austria and Germany, she was discovered by Metro-Goldwyn-Mayer talent scouts, who signed her to a three-year contract in Hollywood in 1935. [CLS] [SEP] A number of filmmakers predicted she might become another Greta Garbo, MGM's leading female star at the time. [CLS] [SEP] Her first American film role was in Escapade in 1935. [CLS] [SEP] The following year she was given a supporting part in the musical biography The Great Ziegfeld, where, despite limited appearances, her emotion-filled performance so impressed audiences that she was awarded the Oscar for Best Actress. [CLS] [SEP] She was later dubbed the "Viennese teardrop" for her dramatic telephone scene in the film. [CLS] [SEP] For her next role, producer Irving Thalberg was convinced, despite the studio's disagreement, that she would also be able to play the part of a poor, plain Chinese farm wife in The Good Earth (1937), based on Pearl Buck's novel about hardship in China. [CLS] [SEP] The subdued character role was such a dramatic contrast to her previous vivacious character that she again won the Academy Award for Best Actress. [CLS] [SEP] Rainer and Jodie Foster are the only actresses ever to win two Oscars by the age of thirty. [CLS] [SEP] However, she later stated nothing worse could have happened to her than winning two consecutive Oscars, as audience expectations from then on would be too high to fulfill. [CLS] [SEP] After a string of insignificant roles, MGM and Rainer became disappointed, leading her to end her brief three-year film career, soon returning to Europe. [CLS] [SEP] Adding to her rapid decline, some feel, was the poor career advice she received from her then-husband, playwright Clifford Odets, along with the unexpected death at age 37 of her producer, Irving Thalberg, whom she greatly admired. [CLS] [SEP] Some film historians consider her the "most extreme case of an Oscar victim in Hollywood mythology". [CLS] [SEP]
