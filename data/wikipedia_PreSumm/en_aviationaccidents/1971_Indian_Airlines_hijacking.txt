[CLS] On 30 January 1971, an Indian Airlines passenger airliner named Ganga, flying from Srinagar to Jammu, was hijacked by two Kashmiri separatists belonging to the National Liberation Front (NLF, the antecedent of Jammu and Kashmir Liberation Front). [SEP] [CLS] The hijackers were Hashim Qureshi and his cousin Ashraf Qureshi. [SEP] [CLS] The aircraft was flown to Lahore, Pakistan where the passengers and the crew were released and the aircraft was burnt down.Ganga was one of the oldest aircraft in the Indian Airlines fleet and was already withdrawn from service but was re-inducted days before the hijacking.India retaliated to the hijacking and subsequent burning by banning overflights of Pakistani aircraft over Indian territory. [SEP] [CLS] The ban, occurring in the run-up to the December 1971 war between the countries, had a significant impact on troop movement into the erstwhile East Pakistan, now Bangladesh. [SEP] [CLS] Pakistan reacted by charging the hijackers and other NLF militants with conspiracy. [SEP] [CLS] The crackdown severely weakened the militant organisation.
