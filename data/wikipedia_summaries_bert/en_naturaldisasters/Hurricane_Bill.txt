[CLS] Hurricane Bill was a large Atlantic tropical cyclone that brought minor damage across mainly Atlantic Canada and the East Coast of the United States during August 2009. [SEP] [CLS] The second named storm, first hurricane, and first major hurricane of the annual hurricane season, Bill originated from a tropical wave in the eastern Atlantic on August 15. [SEP] [CLS] Initially a tropical depression, the cyclone intensified within a favorable atmospheric environment, becoming Tropical Storm Bill six hours after formation. [SEP] [CLS] Steered west-northwest around the southern periphery of a subtropical ridge to the northeast of the cyclone, Bill passed through the central Atlantic. [SEP] [CLS] At 0600 UTC on August 17, the cyclone strengthened into a Category 1 hurricane on the Saffirâ€“Simpson hurricane wind scale; within 36 hours, Bill entered a period of rapid deepening and intensified into a major hurricane with winds of 115 mph (185 km/h). [SEP] [CLS] Passing well northeast of the Lesser Antilles, Bill attained its peak intensity with maximum sustained winds of 130 mph (215 km/h) and a minimum barometric pressure of 943 mb (hPa; 27.85 inHg) on August 19 and August 20, respectively. [SEP] [CLS] Thereafter, an approaching trough induced higher vertical wind shear across the region, causing slow weakening of the hurricane; this same trough resulted in an accelerated motion and curve northward. [SEP] [CLS] As the storm passed Bermuda, it contained sustained winds equal to a Category 2, and ultimately struck Newfoundland as a tropical storm. [SEP] [CLS] After moving inland and weakening to a tropical storm, Bill began an extratropical transition; this alteration in structure was completed by 1200 UTC on August 24. [SEP] [CLS] Two days later, Bill's remnant low was absorbed into a larger extratropical system over the Northern Atlantic. [SEP] [CLS] Bill caused $46.2 million in damages and two deaths over a nine-day period. [SEP] [CLS] As it passed close to Bermuda, the hurricane caused power outages and strong winds, though damage was minor. [SEP] [CLS] Despite remaining well offshore of the United States East Coast, the storm's large wind field contributed to strong surf which caused severe beach erosion. [SEP] [CLS] Numerous offshore rescue operations occurred as a result of people swept away by the strong waves. [SEP] [CLS] All two deaths caused by the hurricane were the result of drownings off the U.S. [SEP] [CLS] coast. [SEP] [CLS] In some areas of New England, the storm's outer rainbands caused flash flooding. [SEP] [CLS] In Atlantic Canada, Bill caused mainly power outages and flooding events. [SEP] [CLS] Several roads were flooded in Nova Scotia, and 32,000 people lost power. [SEP] [CLS] In Newfoundland, where the hurricane made landfall, strong winds caused minor tree damage. [SEP] [CLS] As an extratropical system, Bill dropped light rainfall in the British Isles and Scandinavia. [SEP] [CLS]
