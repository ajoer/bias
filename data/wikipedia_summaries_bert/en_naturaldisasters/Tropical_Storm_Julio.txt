The 2002 Pacific hurricane season was a slightly above average Pacific hurricane season that saw three tropical cyclones reach Category 5 intensity on the Saffir–Simpson scale, tied for the most in a season with 1994 and 2018. [CLS] [SEP] The strongest storm this year was Hurricane Kenna, which reached Category 5 on the Saffir–Simpson scale. [CLS] [SEP] It made landfall near Puerto Vallarta, located in the Mexican state of Jalisco, on October 25. [CLS] [SEP] Elsewhere, Tropical Storm Julio made landfall in Mexico, and Tropical Storm Boris dumped torrential rain along the Mexican coast, despite remaining offshore. [CLS] [SEP] The season officially began on May 15 for the Eastern Pacific, and June 1 for the Central Pacific. [CLS] [SEP] It ended on November 30 for both regions. [CLS] [SEP] These dates delimit the time when most tropical cyclones form in this part of the Pacific Ocean. [CLS] [SEP] The first system formed on May 24 and the final depression dissipated on November 16. [CLS] [SEP] Other storms were individually unusual. [CLS] [SEP] Hurricanes Elida and Hernan also reached Category 5 intensity, but neither caused any damage. [CLS] [SEP] Hurricane Fausto had no effect on land, but it regenerated into a weak tropical storm at an abnormally high latitude. [CLS] [SEP] The season was active, partly due to an El Niño, a meteorological weather phenomenon, that produces favorable conditions across the Pacific ocean, such as lower wind shear, and higher sea surface temperatures.
