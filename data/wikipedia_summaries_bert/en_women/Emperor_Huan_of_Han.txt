Emperor Huan of Han (Chinese: 漢桓帝; pinyin: Hàn Huán Dì; Wade–Giles: Han Huan-ti; 132 – 25 January 168) was the 27th emperor of the Han Dynasty after he was enthroned by the Empress Dowager and her brother Liang Ji on 1 August 146. [CLS] [SEP] He was a great-grandson of Emperor Zhang. [CLS] [SEP] After Emperor Zhi was poisoned to death by the powerful official Liang Ji in 146, Liang Ji persuaded his sister, the regent Empress Dowager Liang to make the 14-year-old Liu Zhi, the Marquess of Liwu, who was betrothed to their sister Liang Nüying (梁女瑩), emperor. [CLS] [SEP] As the years went by, Emperor Huan, offended by Liang Ji's autocratic and violent nature, became determined to eliminate the Liang family with the help of eunuchs. [CLS] [SEP] Emperor Huan succeeded in removing Liang Ji in 159 but this only caused an increase in the influence of these eunuchs over all aspects of the government. [CLS] [SEP] Corruption during this period had reached a boiling point. [CLS] [SEP] In 166, university students rose up in protest against the government and called on Emperor Huan to eliminate all corrupt officials. [CLS] [SEP] Instead of listening, Emperor Huan ordered the arrest of all students involved. [CLS] [SEP] Emperor Huan has largely been viewed as an emperor who might have had some intelligence but lacked wisdom in governing his empire; and his reign contributed greatly to the downfall of the Eastern Han Dynasty. [CLS] [SEP] Hou Hanshu (History of the Later Han) recounts that one Roman envoy (perhaps sent by emperor Marcus Aurelius) reached the Chinese capital Luoyang in 166 and was greeted by Emperor Huan. [CLS] [SEP] Emperor Huan died in 168 after reigning for 22 years; he was 36. [CLS] [SEP] He was succeeded by Emperor Ling of Han. [CLS] [SEP]
