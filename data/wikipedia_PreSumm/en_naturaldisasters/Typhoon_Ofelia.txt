[CLS] Typhoon Ofelia, known as Typhoon Bising in the Philippines, was the first of two typhoons in 1990 to directly affect the Philippines within a week. [SEP] [CLS] Typhoon Ofelia originated from an area of disturbed weather embedded in the monsoon trough situated near the Caroline Islands. [SEP] [CLS] Slowly organizing, the disturbance tracked westward, and was designated a tropical depression on June 15. [SEP] [CLS] After an increase in convection, the depression was upgraded into a tropical storm on June 17. [SEP] [CLS] On June 19, Ofelia turned northwest and after development of a central dense overcast, Ofelia was upgraded into a typhoon late on June 20. [SEP] [CLS] After turning north, Ofelia obtained its maximum intensity following the development of an eye. [SEP] [CLS] The typhoon skirted past the northeastern tip of Luzon and near the east coast of Taiwan, commencing a rapid weakening trend. [SEP] [CLS] On the evening on June 23, Ofelia struck the southern portion of Zhejiang. [SEP] [CLS] The storm then began to track north, recurving towards the Korean Peninsula. [SEP] [CLS] The storm tracked through the province of Jiangsu, and at 00:00 UTC on June 24, transitioned into an extratropical cyclone, only to merge with a frontal zone on June 25. [SEP] [CLS] Although the inner core avoided the Philippines, the storm's large size resulted in inundation across the northern Philippines. [SEP] [CLS] The province of La Union was the hardest hit by the typhoon, where 22 people were killed and 90 homes were crushed. [SEP] [CLS] Three children perished and six others sustained injuries in Pasig. [SEP] [CLS] Overall, 56 people were killed and over 85,000 individuals were forced to flee their homes. [SEP] [CLS] Taiwan bore a direct landfall from Ofelia, dropping up to 460 mm (18 in) of rain. [SEP] [CLS] Hualien City was the hardest hit by the typhoon, where five people were killed. [SEP] [CLS] In all, Ofelia was the worst to hit eastern Taiwan in 30 years. [SEP] [CLS] More than 200 houses were destroyed or damaged and roughly 8,500 ha (21,005 acres) of rice paddies and vegetables were flooded. [SEP] [CLS] Roads and highways were blocked by landslides and floods. [SEP] [CLS] Agricultural losses exceeded NT$2.55 billion (US$94.7 million). [SEP] [CLS] Seventeen people died and twenty-three were missing due to flooding and mudslides. [SEP] [CLS] Although during a weakening phase at the time, the typhoon drenched central China.
