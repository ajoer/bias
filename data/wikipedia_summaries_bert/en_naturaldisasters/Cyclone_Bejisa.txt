[CLS] Cyclone Bejisa was a powerful tropical cyclone that affected the islands of Réunion and Mauritius in early January 2014. [SEP] [CLS] In late December 2013, a tropical disturbance developed to the north of Madagascar. [SEP] [CLS] With favorable conditions, the low developed into a disturbance and soon into a depression on December 28. [SEP] [CLS] The system continued to develop and intensified into Moderate Tropical Storm Bejisa on December 29, with rapid intensification occurring. [SEP] [CLS] It developed into an Intense Tropical Cyclone on December 30, reaching peak maximum sustained winds of 165 km/h (105 mph). [SEP] [CLS] Due to an eyewall replacement cycle, Bejisa weakened, but re-intensified to a secondary peak of 160 km/h (100 mph) on January 1. [SEP] [CLS] Increased wind shear weakened the eyewall, which passed within 15 km (9 mi) of Réunion. [SEP] [CLS] After having moved generally south-southeastward for much of its duration, Bejisa turned to the southwest on January 3, by which time it had weakened to tropical storm status. [SEP] [CLS] It became a post-tropical cyclone on January 5 after the convection weakened over the center, and Bejisa became extratropical the next day as it meandered southwest of Madagascar. [SEP] [CLS] In its formative stages, Bejisa brought heavy rainfall to Seychelles, and it also dropped rainfall in Mauritius and Madagascar. [SEP] [CLS] Effects were worst on Réunion, where wind gusts were around 130–150 km/h (80–90 mph) along the coast. [SEP] [CLS] The storm also dropped torrential rainfall, peaking at 800 mm (31 in) at a volcano in Cilaos. [SEP] [CLS] The winds and rains downed many trees and power lines, which blocked roads and left 181,000 people without power. [SEP] [CLS] About 49% of the island also lost water supply. [SEP] [CLS] Bejisa left heavy damage to the agriculture industry, mainly to vanilla and sugar cane, totaling €62 million (US$84.8 million) in losses. [SEP] [CLS] The commune of Saint-Paul sustained moderate damage, with losses estimated at €3 million (US$4.1 million). [SEP] [CLS] Bejisa killed one person on the island due to head trauma, and there were 16 injuries. [SEP] [CLS] Later, the cyclone produced high waves in South Africa. [SEP] [CLS]
