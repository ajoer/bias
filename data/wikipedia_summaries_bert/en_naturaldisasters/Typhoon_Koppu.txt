[CLS] Typhoon Koppu, known in the Philippines as Typhoon Lando, was a powerful and devastating tropical cyclone that struck Luzon in October 2015. [SEP] [CLS] It was the twenty-fourth named storm and the fifteenth typhoon of the annual typhoon season. [SEP] [CLS] Similar to Goni earlier in the year, Koppu originated from a tropical disturbance east of the Mariana Islands on October 10. [SEP] [CLS] Moving briskly west, the system consolidated into a tropical depression the following day and further into a tropical storm on October 13. [SEP] [CLS] Situated over the warm waters of the Philippine Sea, Koppu quickly deepened. [SEP] [CLS] The storm reached its peak intensity on October 17 with ten-minute sustained winds of 185 km/h (115 mph) according to the Japan Meteorological Agency (JMA). [SEP] [CLS] The Joint Typhoon Warning Center assessed Koppu to have been a Category 4-equivalent super typhoon with one-minute sustained winds of 240 km/h (150 mph). [SEP] [CLS] The storm subsequently made landfall at this strength near Casiguran, Philippines. [SEP] [CLS] Rapid weakening ensued due to interaction with the mountainous terrain of Luzon and the disheveled core of Koppu emerged over the West Philippine Sea on October 19. [SEP] [CLS] Unfavorable environmental conditions inhibited reorganization and the system diminished to a tropical depression on October 21. [SEP] [CLS] Prior to Koppu's landfall, PAGASA raised Public Storm Warning Signals for numerous provinces; nearly 24,000 people evacuated accordingly. [SEP] [CLS] The storm caused tremendous structural damage in coastal provinces, with thousands of structures damaged or destroyed. [SEP] [CLS] Prolonged, heavy rains—peaking at 1,077.8 mm (42.43 in) in Baguio—exacerbated the storm's effects and resulted in widespread flooding. [SEP] [CLS] 62 people were killed across the country and more than 100,000 others were displaced. [SEP] [CLS] Preliminary damage totals amount to ₱14.4 billion (US$313 million). [SEP] [CLS]
