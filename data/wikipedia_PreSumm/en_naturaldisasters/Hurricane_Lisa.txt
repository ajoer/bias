[CLS] The 2010 Atlantic hurricane season was the first in a group of three very active (and third-most active) Atlantic hurricane seasons. [SEP] [CLS] It is tied alongside 1887, 1995, 2011, and 2012 for the third-most active Atlantic hurricane season on record, with 19 tropical storms, only behind the 1933 and the 2005 seasons. [SEP] [CLS] The hyperactive season featured 12 hurricanes, tied with 1969 for the second highest total. [SEP] [CLS] Only the quintessential 2005 season saw more activity. [SEP] [CLS] Despite the high number of hurricanes, not one hurricane hit the United States making the season the only season with 10 or more hurricanes without a United States landfall. [SEP] [CLS] The overall tropical cyclone count in the Atlantic exceeded that in the West Pacific for only the second time on record. [SEP] [CLS] The season officially began on June 1 and ended on November 30, dates that conventionally delimit the period during each year when tropical cyclone formation is most likely. [SEP] [CLS] The first cyclone, Alex intensified into the first June hurricane since Allison in 1995. [SEP] [CLS] The month of September featured eight named storms, tying 2002 and 2007 for the record. [SEP] [CLS] October featured five hurricanes, just short of the record set in 1870. [SEP] [CLS] Finally, Hurricane Tomas became the latest hurricane on record to move through the Windward Islands in late October. [SEP] [CLS] Activity was represented with an accumulated cyclone energy (ACE) value of 165 units, which was the eleventh highest value on record at the time. [SEP] [CLS] The very active activity in 2010 was due to a very strong La Ni√±a, which led to a very quiet Pacific hurricane season. [SEP] [CLS] Numerous tropical cyclones affected countries bordering the Atlantic Ocean throughout 2010. [SEP] [CLS] Alex caused 52 deaths and up to $1.52 billion (2010 USD) in damage as it struck northern Mexico in June. [SEP] [CLS] The next month, Tropical Storm Bonnie struck Florida as a weak cyclone, leaving one dead. [SEP] [CLS] Tropical Storm Colin led to one drowning death, and rip currents produced by Tropical Depression Five killed two people. [SEP] [CLS] Hurricane Danielle passed east of Bermuda while Earl moved parallel to the East Coast of the United States and into Nova Scotia throughout late August, resulting in 2 and 8 deaths, respectively. [SEP] [CLS] In early September, Tropical Storm Hermine caused significant flooding across Texas and killed 8 people. [SEP] [CLS] The strongest hurricane of the year, Igor, killed four as it traversed the Atlantic and across Newfoundland. [SEP] [CLS] Latin America was badly hit by Hurricane Karl and Tropical Storm Matthew, with 22 and 126 deaths, respectively. [SEP] [CLS] In late September, Tropical Storm Nicole produced torrential rainfall from the Caribbean into the U.S. [SEP] [CLS] East Coast, resulting in 16 fatalities. [SEP] [CLS] Hurricane Paula caused a tourist to drown offshore Cozumel in mid-October, while Hurricane Richard left two dead in Belize later that month. [SEP] [CLS] The season concluded with Tomas which caused 35 fatalities along its track through the Caribbean and into the Atlantic. [SEP] [CLS]
