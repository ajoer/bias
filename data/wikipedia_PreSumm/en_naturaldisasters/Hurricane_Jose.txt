[CLS] Hurricane Jose was a powerful and erratic tropical cyclone which was the longest-lived Atlantic hurricane since Hurricane Nadine in 2012. [SEP] [CLS] Jose was the tenth named storm, fifth hurricane, and third major hurricane of the 2017 Atlantic hurricane season. [SEP] [CLS] Jose developed into a tropical storm on September 5 from a tropical wave that left the west coast of Africa nearly a week prior. [SEP] [CLS] A period of rapid intensification ensued on September 6, when Jose reached hurricane intensity. [SEP] [CLS] On September 8, it reached its peak intensity as a high-end Category 4 hurricane. [SEP] [CLS] However, due to wind shear, Jose weakened over the next few days as it completed an anti-cyclonic loop north of Hispaniola. [SEP] [CLS] Despite weakening to a tropical storm on September 14, Jose managed to regain hurricane intensity the next day as it began to curve northwards. [SEP] [CLS] Never strengthening above Category 1 status for the remainder of its lifespan, Jose degraded to a tropical storm once again on September 20. [SEP] [CLS] Two days later, Jose transitioned into a post-tropical cyclone as it drifted northeastwards off the coast of New England. [SEP] [CLS] By September 26, Jose's remnants dissipated off the East Coast of the United States. [SEP] [CLS] Initially projected to impact the Antilles already affected by Hurricane Irma, Jose triggered evacuations in catastrophically damaged Barbuda, as well as in Saint Martin. [SEP] [CLS] Eventually, as Jose changed its path, its inner core and thus the strongest winds stayed offshore. [SEP] [CLS] Nonetheless, Jose still brought tropical storm-force winds to those islands. [SEP] [CLS] Later on, Jose brought heavy rain, swells, and rough surf to the East Coast of the United States, causing beach erosion and some flooding.
