Subtropical Storm Nicole was the first subtropical storm to receive a name using the standard hurricane name list that did not become a tropical cyclone. [CLS] [SEP] The fifteenth tropical or subtropical cyclone and fourteenth named storm of the 2004 Atlantic hurricane season, Nicole developed on October 10 near Bermuda from a broad surface low that developed as a result of the interaction between an upper level trough and a decaying cold front. [CLS] [SEP] The storm turned to the northeast, passing close to Bermuda as it intensified to reach peak winds of 50 mph (85 km/h) on October 11. [CLS] [SEP] Deep convection developed near the center of the system as it attempted to become a fully tropical cyclone. [CLS] [SEP] However, it failed to do so and was absorbed by an extratropical cyclone late on October 11. [CLS] [SEP] Nicole dropped moderate amounts of rainfall in Bermuda, while rough seas caused problems for cruise lines. [CLS] [SEP] In Canada, the remnants of the storm combined with an extratropical storm to produce strong winds and heavy rainfall, which caused damage to trees and power lines. [CLS] [SEP] The remnant storm also produced gale-force winds across New England, while swells from the storm provided welcome surf conditions along the East Coast of the United States. [CLS] [SEP]
