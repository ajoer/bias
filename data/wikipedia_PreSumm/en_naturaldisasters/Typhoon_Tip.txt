[CLS] Typhoon Tip, known in the Philippines as Typhoon Warling, was the largest and most intense tropical cyclone ever recorded. [SEP] [CLS] The forty-third tropical depression, nineteenth tropical storm, twelfth typhoon, and third super typhoon of the 1979 Pacific typhoon season, Tip developed out of a disturbance within the monsoon trough on October 4 near Pohnpei in Micronesia. [SEP] [CLS] Initially, a tropical storm to the northwest hindered the development and motion of Tip, though after the storm tracked farther north, Tip was able to intensify. [SEP] [CLS] After passing Guam, Tip rapidly intensified and reached peak sustained winds of 305 km/h (190 mph) and a worldwide record-low sea-level pressure of 870 hPa (25.69 inHg) on October 12. [SEP] [CLS] At its peak strength, Tip was the largest tropical cyclone on record, with a wind diameter of 2,220 km (1,380 mi). [SEP] [CLS] Tip slowly weakened as it continued west-northwestward and later turned to the northeast, in response to an approaching trough. [SEP] [CLS] The typhoon made landfall in southern Japan on October 19, and became an extratropical cyclone shortly thereafter. [SEP] [CLS] Tip's extratropical remnants continued moving east-northeastward, until they dissipated near the Aleutian Islands on October 24. [SEP] [CLS] U.S. [SEP] [CLS] Air Force aircraft flew 60 weather reconnaissance missions into the typhoon, making Tip one of the most closely observed tropical cyclones. [SEP] [CLS] Rainfall from Tip indirectly led to a fire that killed 13 Marines and injured 68 at Combined Arms Training Center, Camp Fuji in the Shizuoka Prefecture of Japan. [SEP] [CLS] Elsewhere in the country, the typhoon caused widespread flooding and 42 deaths; offshore shipwrecks left 44 people killed or missing. [SEP] [CLS]
