[CLS] Hurricane Edna was a deadly and destructive major hurricane that impacted the United States East Coast in September of the 1954 Atlantic hurricane season. [SEP] [CLS] It was one of two hurricanes to strike Massachusetts in that year, the other being Hurricane Carol. [SEP] [CLS] The fifth tropical cyclone and storm of the season, as well as the fourth hurricane and second major hurricane, Edna developed from a tropical wave on September 2. [SEP] [CLS] Moving towards the north-northwest, Edna skirted the northern Leeward Islands as a tropical depression before turning more towards the west. [SEP] [CLS] The depression attained tropical storm status to the east of Puerto Rico and strengthened further to reach hurricane status by September 7. [SEP] [CLS] The storm rapidly intensified and reached its peak intensity of 125 mph (205 km/h) north of the Bahamas before weakening to Category 2 status near landfall in Massachusetts on September 11. [SEP] [CLS] Edna transitioned into an extratropical cyclone in Atlantic Canada before its remnants dissipated in the northern Atlantic. [SEP] [CLS] Edna caused 20 fatalities throughout its lifetime as a tropical cyclone, as well as a moderate amount of damage. [SEP] [CLS] It first caused rainfall-induced flooding in Puerto Rico, and it later brushed the Bahamas. [SEP] [CLS] High waves affected the coastline of North Carolina. [SEP] [CLS] Edna resulted in the heaviest day of rainfall in New York City in 45 years, while strong waves cut off Montauk from the remainder of Long Island. [SEP] [CLS] There were six highway deaths in the state, and $1.5 million in crop damage. [SEP] [CLS] There were widespread evacuations in southern New England, after Hurricane Carol struck the same area only 11 days prior. [SEP] [CLS] Strong winds caused extensive power outages for 260,000 people, including nearly all of Cape Cod. [SEP] [CLS] Edna became the costliest hurricane in the history of Maine, where the hurricane caused flooding that washed out roads and rail lines. [SEP] [CLS] There were 21 deaths in New England, eight of whom in Maine due to drownings. [SEP] [CLS] Later, high winds severely damaged crops in Atlantic Canada. [SEP] [CLS]
