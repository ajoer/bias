Franz Peter Schubert (German: [ˈfʁant͡s ˈpeːtɐ ˈʃuːbɐt]; 31 January 1797 – 19 November 1828) was an Austrian composer of the late Classical and early Romantic eras. [CLS] [SEP] Despite his short lifetime, Schubert left behind a vast oeuvre, including more than 600 secular vocal works (mainly lieder), seven complete symphonies, sacred music, operas, incidental music and a large body of piano and chamber music. [CLS] [SEP] His major works include the Piano Quintet in A major, D. [CLS] [SEP] 667 (Trout Quintet), the Symphony No. [CLS] [SEP] 8 in B minor, D. [CLS] [SEP] 759 (Unfinished Symphony), the ”Great” Symphony No. [CLS] [SEP] 9 in C major, D. [CLS] [SEP] 944, the String Quintet (D. [CLS] [SEP] 956), the three last piano sonatas (D. [CLS] [SEP] 958–960), the opera Fierrabras (D. [CLS] [SEP] 796), the incidental music to the play Rosamunde (D. [CLS] [SEP] 797), and the song cycles Die schöne Müllerin (D. [CLS] [SEP] 795) and Winterreise (D. [CLS] [SEP] 911). [CLS] [SEP] Born in the Himmelpfortgrund suburb of Vienna, Schubert's uncommon gifts for music were evident from an early age. [CLS] [SEP] His father gave him his first violin lessons and his elder brother gave him piano lessons, but Schubert soon exceeded their abilities. [CLS] [SEP] In 1808, at the age of eleven, he became a pupil at the Stadtkonvikt school, where he became acquainted with the orchestral music of Haydn, Mozart, and Beethoven. [CLS] [SEP] He left the Stadtkonvikt at the end of 1813, and returned home to live with his father, where he began studying to become a schoolteacher; despite this, he continued his studies in composition with Antonio Salieri and still composed prolifically. [CLS] [SEP] In 1821, Schubert was admitted to the Gesellschaft der Musikfreunde as a performing member, which helped establish his name among the Viennese citizenry. [CLS] [SEP] He gave a concert of his own works to critical acclaim in March 1828, the only time he did so in his career. [CLS] [SEP] He died eight months later at the age of 31, the cause officially attributed to typhoid fever, but believed by some historians to be syphilis. [CLS] [SEP] Appreciation of Schubert's music while he was alive was limited to a relatively small circle of admirers in Vienna, but interest in his work increased significantly in the decades following his death. [CLS] [SEP] Felix Mendelssohn, Robert Schumann, Franz Liszt, Johannes Brahms and other 19th-century composers discovered and championed his works. [CLS] [SEP] Today, Schubert is ranked among the greatest composers of Western classical music and his music continues to be popular. [CLS] [SEP]
