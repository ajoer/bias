The DFS Habicht (German: "Hawk") is an unlimited aerobatic sailplane that was designed in 1936 by Hans Jacobs with support provided by the Deutsche Forschungsanstalt für Segelflug. [CLS] [SEP] Four planes were made available for the Olympic Games of 1936, where the maneuvers of the Habicht over and literally inside the Olympic stadium enthralled spectators. [CLS] [SEP] The flight qualities of the Habicht were praised by pilots, including Hanna Reitsch. [CLS] [SEP] It participated in many airshows abroad before the war, including the 1938 National Air Races in Cleveland, Ohio.Modified versions of the Habicht, dubbed the Stummel-Habicht ("Stumpy Hawk") were used to train pilots to land the Messerschmitt Me 163 Komet rocket-powered fighter, and allegedly for training Hitler Youth pilots for flying the Heinkel He 162 Spatz jet fighter. [CLS] [SEP] The Me 163 was designed to use its entire load of fuel to reach combat altitude and then return to the ground as a glider, with the He 162A having a short, 30-minute flight envelope with a similarly fast landing speed. [CLS] [SEP] However, the landing speed of around 200 km/h (125 mph) posed a special challenge for pilots. [CLS] [SEP] Trainees therefore began on a Stummel-Habicht on which the original Habicht's 13.6-metre (44 ft 7 in) gull wings had been replaced with straight wings of 8-metre (26 ft 3 in) span, and then progressed to another version with a 6-metre (19 ft 8 in) span. [CLS] [SEP] Few Habichts survived World War II. [CLS] [SEP] There is one craft, flown by famous French aerobatic pilot Marcel Doret, in the Musée de l'Air et de l'Espace in Paris. [CLS] [SEP] Another, with the registration D-8002, flew in Southern Germany until it was destroyed by the collapse of the hangar wherein it was stored. [CLS] [SEP] Apart from these original examples, Türk Hava Kurumu manufactured six reverse-engineered copies of the Habicht as the THK-3 in 1945-1946. [CLS] [SEP] After lengthy and patient research to recover the design documentation, Josef Kurz and other members of the Oldtimer Segelflugclub Wasserkuppe built an all-new Habicht. [CLS] [SEP] After an extended exhibition career, this exemplar, registered also as D-8002, flies from the Wasserkuppe club's airfield. [CLS] [SEP] Another airworthy Habicht was built by the Zahn family and first flew in 2001. [CLS] [SEP] Since then, at the hands of pilot Christoph Zahn, it has provided aerobatics demonstrations at numerous air shows. [CLS] [SEP]
