Severe Tropical Cyclone Joy struck Australia in late 1990, causing the third highest floods on record in Rockhampton, Queensland. [CLS] [SEP] This cyclone began as a weak tropical low near the Solomon Islands, and initially moved westward. [CLS] [SEP] On 18 December, it was named Joy, becoming the 2nd named storm of the 1990–91 Australian region cyclone season. [CLS] [SEP] After turning southwest, Joy developed a well-defined eye and strengthened to maximum sustained winds of 165 km/h (103 mph) while approaching Cairns in Far North Queensland. [CLS] [SEP] Brushing the city with strong winds, the cyclone soon weakened and turned southeast. [CLS] [SEP] Joy later curved back southwest, making landfall near Townsville, Queensland on 26 December. [CLS] [SEP] It dissipated the next day; remnant moisture continued as torrential rainfall over Queensland for two weeks. [CLS] [SEP] While drifting offshore northeastern Australia, the cyclone produced wind gusts as high as 124 km/h (77 mph) in Cairns, strong enough to cause power outages. [CLS] [SEP] In Mackay, a tornado spawned by Joy damaged 40 homes, while torrential rainfall just south of the city peaked at over 2 metres (6.6 ft). [CLS] [SEP] Most storm-associated damage was wrought by severe flooding, which persisted for weeks in hardest-hit locations. [CLS] [SEP] Rains significantly increased water levels on 10 rivers, among them the Fitzroy River, which discharged about 18 trillion litres (4.8×1012 US gallons) of freshwater into Keppel Bay over 25 days. [CLS] [SEP] In turn, the Great Barrier Reef suffered biological damage from coral bleaching and decreased salinity. [CLS] [SEP] The Fitzroy River rose to a 9.30-metre (30.5 ft) peak at Rockhampton, forcing thousands to evacuate homes; some stranded individuals could only obtain food by helicopter. [CLS] [SEP] Elsewhere in Australia, storm moisture alleviated drought conditions and diminished fires near Sydney. [CLS] [SEP] Overall, Joy killed six people and caused A$300 million in damage ($234 million USD). [CLS] [SEP] Afterwards, the Queensland government issued a disaster declaration for about 30% of the state, and the name Joy was retired from the list of tropical cyclone names. [CLS] [SEP]
