[CLS] In September 1934, a violent typhoon caused tremendous devastation in Japan, leaving more than 3,000 people dead in its wake. [SEP] [CLS] Dubbed the Muroto typhoon (室戸台風, Muroto Taifū), the system was first identified on September 13 over the western Federated States of Micronesia. [SEP] [CLS] Moving generally northwest, it eventually brushed the Ryukyu Islands on September 20. [SEP] [CLS] Turning northeast, the typhoon accelerated and struck Shikoku and southern Honshu the following morning. [SEP] [CLS] It made landfalls in Muroto, Kaifu, Awaji Island, and Kobe. [SEP] [CLS] A pressure of 911.9 hPa (26.93 inHg) was observed in Muroto, making the typhoon the strongest ever recorded to impact Japan at the time. [SEP] [CLS] This value was also the lowest land-based pressure reading in the world on record at the time; however, it was surpassed the following year during the 1935 Labor Day hurricane. [SEP] [CLS] After clearing Japan, the now extratropical storm traveled east and weakened. [SEP] [CLS] Turning north by September 24, the system deepened and impacted the Aleutian Islands; it was last noted the following day over western Alaska. [SEP] [CLS] Regarded as the "second-greatest catastrophe of modern Japan", the storm left parts of Osaka in ruins. [SEP] [CLS] Tens of thousands of structures were damaged or destroyed, leaving approximately 200,000 people homeless. [SEP] [CLS] Among the 3,066 people killed were 421 children and teachers who perished when their flimsy schools were destroyed. [SEP] [CLS] This ranked it, at the time, as the deadliest typhoon in Japanese history. [SEP] [CLS] In addition to the fatalities, 13,184 people were injured. [SEP] [CLS] Total damage exceeded $300 million (1934 USD). [SEP] [CLS]
