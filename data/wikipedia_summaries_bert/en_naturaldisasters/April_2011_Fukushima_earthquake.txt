The April 2011 Fukushima earthquake (福島県浜通り地震, Fukushima-ken Hamadōri jishin, lit. [CLS] [SEP] "Fukushima Hamadōri earthquake") was a potent magnitude 6.6 Mw intraplate aftershock that occurred at 17:16 JST (08:16 UTC) on 11 April, in the Hamadōri region of Fukushima, Japan. [CLS] [SEP] With a shallow focus of 13 km (8.1 mi), the earthquake was centred inland about 36 km (22 mi) west of Iwaki, causing widespread strong to locally severe shaking. [CLS] [SEP] It was one of many aftershocks to follow the 11 March Tōhoku earthquake, and the strongest to have its epicentre located inland. [CLS] [SEP] The earthquake occurred as a result of normal faulting to the west of Iwaki, and triggered numerous landslides across adjacent mountainous areas. [CLS] [SEP] A few fires broke out, and 220,000 households lost electricity. [CLS] [SEP] Officials issued localised tsunami alerts, though no significant waves were generated. [CLS] [SEP] The earthquake caused little structural damage, but killed four people and injured ten others. [CLS] [SEP] The strong ground movements triggered the reactivation of a nearby geological fault, prompting researchers to conduct extensive surveys in the region. [CLS] [SEP]
