Hurricane Donna, known in Puerto Rico as Hurricane San Lorenzo, was the strongest hurricane of the 1960 Atlantic hurricane season, and caused severe damage to the Lesser Antilles, the Greater Antilles, and the East Coast of the United States, especially Florida, in Augustâ€“September. [CLS] [SEP] The fifth tropical cyclone, third hurricane, and first major hurricane of the season, Donna developed south of Cape Verde on August 29, spawned by a tropical wave to which 63 deaths from a plane crash in Senegal were attributed. [CLS] [SEP] The depression strengthened into Tropical Storm Donna by the following day. [CLS] [SEP] Donna moved west-northwestward at roughly 20 mph (32 km/h) and by September 1, it reached hurricane status. [CLS] [SEP] Over the next three days, Donna deepened significantly and reached maximum sustained winds of 130 mph (210 km/h) on September 4. [CLS] [SEP] Thereafter, it maintained intensity as it struck the Lesser Antilles later that day. [CLS] [SEP] On Sint Maarten, the storm left a quarter of the island's population homeless and killed seven people. [CLS] [SEP] An additional five deaths were reported in Anguilla, and there were seven other fatalities throughout the Virgin Islands. [CLS] [SEP] In Puerto Rico, severe flash flooding led to 107 fatalities, 85 of them in Humacao alone. [CLS] [SEP] Donna further intensified to a Category 4 hurricane early on September 6, and attained peak winds of 145 mph (230 km/h) twenty-four hours later. [CLS] [SEP] The storm then weakened over the next few days, making multiple landfalls in The Bahamas as a Category 3 hurricane. [CLS] [SEP] Donna generated severe wind gusts of up to 173 mph (278 km/h) over southern portions of the archipelago nation, and prolific rains affected the country and the nearby Turks and Caicos Islands. [CLS] [SEP] Several small island communities in the southern regions of The Bahamas were leveled, but no damage total or fatalities were reported. [CLS] [SEP] As it neared the United States, Donna encountered weaker steering currents, turned northwestward, and re-intensified. [CLS] [SEP] Early on September 10, Donna made landfall on the Florida Keys with winds of 145 mph (230 km/h), the most severe observed there since 1935. [CLS] [SEP] Donna then weakened as it paralleled the southwestern Florida peninsula, making landfall south of Naples with winds of 120 mph (195 km/h). [CLS] [SEP] In the Florida Keys, coastal flooding severely damaged 75% of buildings, destroyed several subdivisions in Marathon. [CLS] [SEP] On the mainland, 5,200 houses were damaged, which does not include the 75% of homes damaged at Fort Myers Beach; 50% of buildings were also destroyed in the city of Everglades. [CLS] [SEP] Crop losses were also extensive. [CLS] [SEP] A total of 50% of the grapefruit crop was lost, 10% of the orange and tangerine crop was lost, and the avocado crop was almost destroyed. [CLS] [SEP] In the state of Florida alone, there were 13 deaths and $300 million in losses. [CLS] [SEP] Donna weakened over Florida and was a Category 1 hurricane when it re-emerged into the Atlantic from North Florida. [CLS] [SEP] By early on September 12, the storm made landfall near Topsail Beach, North Carolina, as a Category 2 hurricane. [CLS] [SEP] Donna brought tornadoes and wind gusts up to 100 mph (155 km/h), damaging or destroying several buildings in Eastern North Carolina, while crops were damaged as far as 50 miles (80 km) inland. [CLS] [SEP] Additionally, storm surge caused significant beach erosion and structural damage at Wilmington and Nags Head. [CLS] [SEP] Eight people were killed and there were over 100 injuries. [CLS] [SEP] Later on September 12, Donna reemerged into the Atlantic Ocean and continued to move northeastward. [CLS] [SEP] The storm struck Long Island, New York, late on September 12 and rapidly weakened inland. [CLS] [SEP] On the following day, Donna became extratropical over Maine. [CLS] [SEP]
