The Marquess of Beixiang (simplified Chinese: 北乡侯; traditional Chinese: 北鄉侯; pinyin: Běixiāng Hóu; Wade–Giles: Pei-hsiang-hou; died 10 December 125), personal name Liu Yi, also referred to as Emperor Shao (少帝, literally "young emperor"), was an emperor of the Chinese Han Dynasty. [CLS] [SEP] He was selected to succeed Emperor An after Emperor An's sudden death in 125, but died soon after he became emperor and a eunuch coup in favour of Emperor Shun overthrew the regime of Empress Dowager Yan, who put him on the throne. [CLS] [SEP] No historical records indicate his age, but later references to him imply that he was young, perhaps a child. [CLS] [SEP] As his reign was short and considered at least somewhat illegitimate, he is often omitted from the official list of emperors. [CLS] [SEP]
