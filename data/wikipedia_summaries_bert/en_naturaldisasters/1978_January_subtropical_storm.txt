The 1978 Atlantic hurricane season was the last Atlantic hurricane season to use an all-female naming list. [CLS] [SEP] The hurricane season officially began on June 1, and ended on November 30. [CLS] [SEP] It was an above average season due to a subsiding El Niño. [CLS] [SEP] The first storm, a subtropical storm, developed unusually early – on January 18 – and dissipated five days later without causing any damage. [CLS] [SEP] At the end of July and early August, short-lived Tropical Storm Amelia caused extensive flooding in Texas after dropping as much as 48 in (1,200 mm) of rain. [CLS] [SEP] There were 33 deaths and $110 million (1978 USD) in damage. [CLS] [SEP] Tropical Storm Bess and Hurricane Cora resulted in only minor land impacts, while the latter was attributed to one fatality. [CLS] [SEP] Later in August, Tropical Storm Debra produced widespread effects, though damage was also relatively minor. [CLS] [SEP] Hurricane Ella became the northernmost Category 4 hurricane while located at 38°N, and lashed the East Coast of the United States and Atlantic Canada with gusty winds and rip currents. [CLS] [SEP] Hurricanes Flossie and Kendra as well as Tropical Storms Hope, Irma, and Juliet caused minimal land impacts as a tropical cyclone. [CLS] [SEP] However, the precursor to Hurricane Kendra caused flooding in Puerto Rico. [CLS] [SEP] Hurricane Greta brought strong winds, high tides, and flooding to Central America, particularly Belize and Honduras. [CLS] [SEP] Greta resulted in about $25 million in damage and at least five fatalities. [CLS] [SEP] Overall, the storms of this season collectively caused $191 million in damage and 42 fatalities. [CLS] [SEP] Hurricane Greta crossed into the eastern pacific and was renamed Olivia. [CLS] [SEP]
