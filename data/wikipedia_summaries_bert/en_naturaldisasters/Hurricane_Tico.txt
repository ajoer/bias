Hurricane Tico is one of four major hurricanes to strike Mazatlan. [CLS] [SEP] The origins of Hurricane Tico were from a weak tropical disturbance that crossed Costa Rica into the Pacific Ocean on October 7, 1983. [CLS] [SEP] Over warm waters, the system was sufficiently organized to be declared Tropical Depression Twenty-One on October 11, about 575 mi (930 km) south of Acapulco. [CLS] [SEP] On October 12 it turned sharply northward; the depression was upgraded to Tropical Storm Tico on October 13. [CLS] [SEP] Tropical Storm Tico continued to intensify. [CLS] [SEP] Two days after becoming a tropical storm, Tico strengthened further to attain hurricane status. [CLS] [SEP] Early on October 19, it reached peak winds of 130 mph (215 km/h). [CLS] [SEP] It weakened slightly as it approached the coast, and at about 1500 UTC that day Tico made landfall near Mazatlán with winds of 125 mph (205 km/h). [CLS] [SEP] The remains were tracked into the Mid-Atlantic States for five more days. [CLS] [SEP] Tico was the deadliest and most destructive tropical cyclone of the season. [CLS] [SEP] Overall, the hurricane sank nine small ships, and nine fishermen were killed. [CLS] [SEP] Hurricane Tico was responsible severe flooding and heavy damage due to strong winds. [CLS] [SEP] Throughout the state of Sinaloa, the hurricane destroyed nearly 19,000 acres (77 km²) of bean and corn, although most of the agricultural damage occurred south of Mazatlán.
