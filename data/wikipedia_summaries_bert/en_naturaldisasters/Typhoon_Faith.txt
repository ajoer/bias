Typhoon Faith, known in the Philippines as Typhoon Norming, struck both the Philippines and Vietnam during December 1998. [CLS] [SEP] A tropical disturbance developed within the vicinity of the western Caroline Islands during early December. [CLS] [SEP] At midday on December 8, the system developed into a tropical depression. [CLS] [SEP] Tracking northwest at a brisk pace, the depression gradually intensified, and was upgraded into a tropical storm at noon on December 9. [CLS] [SEP] Quickly intensifying, Faith turned to the west-northwest, and after tracking near Samar Island on the evening of December 10, Faith attained typhoon intensity. [CLS] [SEP] After clipping the northern tip of Palawan Island, the typhoon entered the South China Sea at peak intensity. [CLS] [SEP] Across the Philippines, 33 people were killed, with 30 others wounded and 36 others listed missing. [CLS] [SEP] A total of 6,423 homes were damaged and 3,234 houses were destroyed, leaving more than 20,000 homeless. [CLS] [SEP] Damage was estimated at $25.9 million, with $6.82 million from crops, $15.9 million from public infrastructure, and $3.37 million from private infrastructure. [CLS] [SEP] The typhoon tracked westward before tracking west-southwest, only to decelerate to the west-northwest. [CLS] [SEP] Increased wind shear took toll on the storm and caused a weakening trend. [CLS] [SEP] On December 12, Faith lost typhoon intensity, and two days later, Faith weakened into a tropical depression. [CLS] [SEP] After striking Vietnam, the depression rapidly dissipated over land. [CLS] [SEP] At least 38 people were killed in Vietnam with over 10,000 evacuated due to flooding in low-lying areas. [CLS] [SEP] Damage in Vietnam exceeded $20 million. [CLS] [SEP]
