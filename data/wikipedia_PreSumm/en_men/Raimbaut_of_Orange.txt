[CLS] Raimbaut of Orange (c. [SEP] [CLS] 1147 â€“ 1173) or, in his native Old Occitan, Raimbaut d'Aurenga, was the lord of Orange and Aumelas. [SEP] [CLS] His properties included the towns of Frontignan and Mireval. [SEP] [CLS] He was the only son of William of Aumelas and of Tiburge, daughter of Raimbaut, count of Orange. [SEP] [CLS] After the early death of Raimbaut's father, his guardians were his uncle William VII of Montpellier and his elder sister Tibors. [SEP] [CLS] He was a major troubadour, having contributed to the creation of trobar ric, or articulate style, in troubadour poetry. [SEP] [CLS] About forty of his works survive, displaying a gusto for rare rhymes and intricate poetic form. [SEP] [CLS] His death in 1173 is mourned in a planh (lament) by Giraut de Bornelh, and also in the only surviving poem of the trobairitz Azalais de Porcairagues, who was the lover of Raimbaut's cousin Gui Guerrejat. [SEP] [CLS] It seems possible that Azalais's poem was composed in an earlier form while Raimbaut was still alive, because in his poem A mon vers dirai chanso he appears to contribute to the poetical debate begun by Guilhem de Saint-Leidier and taken up by Azalais as to whether a lady is dishonoured by taking a lover who is richer than herself. [SEP] [CLS] Aimo Sakari argues that Azalais is the mysterious joglar ("jongleur") addressed in several poems by Raimbaut. [SEP] [CLS]
