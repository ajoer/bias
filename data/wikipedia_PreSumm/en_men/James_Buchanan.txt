[CLS] James Buchanan Jr. [SEP] [CLS] (; April 23, 1791 – June 1, 1868) was an American lawyer and politician who served as the 15th president of the United States (1857–1861). [SEP] [CLS] He previously served as Secretary of State (1845–1849) and represented Pennsylvania in both houses of the U.S. [SEP] [CLS] Congress. [SEP] [CLS] He was a states' rights advocate, and minimized the role of the federal government in the nation's closing era of slavery. [SEP] [CLS] He is therefore consistently ranked by historians as one of the least effective presidents in history, for his failure to mitigate the national disunity that led to the American Civil War. [SEP] [CLS] Buchanan was a prominent lawyer in Pennsylvania and won his first election to the state’s House of Representatives as a Federalist. [SEP] [CLS] In 1820, he was elected to the U.S. [SEP] [CLS] House of Representatives and retained that post for 11 years, aligning with Andrew Jackson's Democratic Party. [SEP] [CLS] He served as Jackson's Minister to Russia (1832). [SEP] [CLS] He won election in 1834 as a U.S. [SEP] [CLS] senator from Pennsylvania and also held that position for 11 years. [SEP] [CLS] In 1845 he was appointed to serve as President James K. [SEP] [CLS] Polk's Secretary of State, and in 1853 he was named as President Franklin Pierce's Minister to the United Kingdom. [SEP] [CLS] Beginning in 1844 Buchanan became a regular contender for the Democratic party's presidential nomination. [SEP] [CLS] He was finally nominated in 1856, defeating incumbent Franklin Pierce and Senator Stephen A. [SEP] [CLS] Douglas at the Democratic National Convention. [SEP] [CLS] Buchanan and running mate John C. [SEP] [CLS] Breckinridge of Kentucky defeated Republican John C. [SEP] [CLS] Frémont and Know-Nothing former president Millard Fillmore to win the 1856 presidential election. [SEP] [CLS] Buchanan supported the decision of the Supreme Court in the Dred Scott case, which denied a slave's petition for freedom. [SEP] [CLS] He also joined with Southern leaders in attempting to admit Kansas to the Union as a slave state. [SEP] [CLS] He thereby angered not only the Republicans but also many Northern Democrats. [SEP] [CLS] Buchanan honored his pledge to serve only one term, and supported Breckinridge's unsuccessful candidacy in the 1860 presidential election, which was won by Republican Abraham Lincoln. [SEP] [CLS] Just weeks after Lincoln was elected as Buchanan's successor, Southern states began seceding from the U.S., and the American Civil War started. [SEP] [CLS] Historians fault Buchanan for not addressing the issue of slavery, and for not forestalling the secession. [SEP] [CLS]
