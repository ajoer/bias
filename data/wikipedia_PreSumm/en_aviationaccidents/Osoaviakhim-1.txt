[CLS] Osoaviakhim-1 was a record-setting, hydrogen-filled Soviet high-altitude balloon designed to seat a crew of three and perform scientific studies of the Earth's stratosphere. [SEP] [CLS] On January 30, 1934, on its maiden flight, which lasted over 7 hours, the balloon reached an altitude of 22,000 metres (72,000 ft). [SEP] [CLS] During the descent the balloon lost its buoyancy and plunged into an uncontrolled fall, disintegrating in the lower atmosphere. [SEP] [CLS] The three crew members, probably incapacitated by high g-forces in a rapidly rotating gondola, failed to bail out and were killed by the high-speed ground impact.According to public investigation reports, the crash was ultimately caused by a prolonged stay at record altitudes exceeding maximum design limits. [SEP] [CLS] The balloon, overheated by sunlight, lost too much lifting gas in the upper atmosphere. [SEP] [CLS] As it descended past the 12,000 metres (39,000 ft) mark, cooling down to ambient air temperature, a rapid loss of buoyancy caused a downward acceleration that triggered the structural failure of the suspension cables. [SEP] [CLS] The aircraft design was marked by numerous engineering flaws, notably insufficient ballast weight and faulty gondola suspension design, which all contributed to the loss of life.Later Soviet manned high-altitude balloons improved on safety devices and did not venture above 16,000 metres (52,000 ft); the program was nevertheless marked with accidents and failures and was terminated after the Osoaviakhim-2 launch failure in June 1940.
