Hurricane Iniki ( ee-NEE-kee; Hawaiian: ʻiniki meaning "strong and piercing wind") was the most powerful hurricane to strike the U.S. [CLS] [SEP] state of Hawaii in recorded history. [CLS] [SEP] Forming on September 5, 1992, during the strong 1990–1995 El Niño, Iniki was one of eleven Central Pacific tropical cyclones during that season. [CLS] [SEP] It attained tropical storm status on September 8 and further intensified into a hurricane the next day. [CLS] [SEP] After turning north, Iniki struck the island of Kauaʻi on September 11 at peak intensity; it had winds of 145 mph and reached Category 4 status on the Saffir–Simpson hurricane scale. [CLS] [SEP] It had recorded wind gusts of 225 as evidenced by an anemometer that was found blown into the forest during clean up. [CLS] [SEP] It was the first hurricane to hit the state since Hurricane Iwa in the 1982 season, and the first major hurricane since Hurricane Dot in 1959. [CLS] [SEP] Iniki dissipated on September 13 about halfway between Hawaii and Alaska. [CLS] [SEP] Iniki caused around $3.1 billion (1992 USD) in damage and six deaths, making it the costliest natural disaster on record in the state, and the second-costliest Pacific hurricane on record. [CLS] [SEP] At the time, Iniki was among the costliest United States hurricanes. [CLS] [SEP] The storm struck just 18 days after Hurricane Andrew, the costliest tropical cyclone ever at the time, struck Florida. [CLS] [SEP] The Central Pacific Hurricane Center (CPHC) failed to issue tropical cyclone warnings and watches 24 hours in advance. [CLS] [SEP] Despite the lack of early warning, only six deaths ensued. [CLS] [SEP] Damage was greatest on Kauaʻi, where the hurricane destroyed more than 1,400 houses and severely damaged more than 5,000. [CLS] [SEP] Though not directly in the path of the eye, Oʻahu experienced moderate damage from wind and storm surge. [CLS] [SEP]
