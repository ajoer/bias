[CLS] Hurricane Sandra was the latest-forming major hurricane in the northeastern Pacific basin, the strongest November Pacific hurricane on record, and the record eleventh major hurricane of the 2015 Pacific hurricane season. [SEP] [CLS] Originating from a tropical wave, Sandra was first classified as a tropical depression on November 23 well south of Mexico. [SEP] [CLS] Environmental conditions, including high sea surface temperatures and low wind shear, were highly conducive to intensification and the storm quickly organized. [SEP] [CLS] A small central dense overcast developed atop the storm and Sandra reached hurricane status early on November 25 after the consolidation of an eye. [SEP] [CLS] Sandra reached its peak intensity as a Category 4 hurricane on the Saffir–Simpson hurricane wind scale with winds of 150 mph (240 km/h) and a pressure of 934 mbar (hPa; 27.58 inHg) early on November 26. [SEP] [CLS] This made Sandra the strongest November hurricane on record in the Northeastern Pacific. [SEP] [CLS] Thereafter, increasing shear degraded the hurricane's structure and weakening ensued. [SEP] [CLS] Rapid weakening took place on November 27 and Sandra's circulation became devoid of convection as it diminished to a tropical storm that evening. [SEP] [CLS] The cyclone degenerated into a remnant low soon thereafter and ultimately dissipated just off the coast of Sinaloa, Mexico, on November 29. [SEP] [CLS] As the precursor to Sandra traversed Central America, it produced unseasonably heavy rainfall that triggered flooding and landslides. [SEP] [CLS] Four people died in various incidents related to the system: three in El Salvador and one in Honduras. [SEP] [CLS] Initially expecting a landfalling storm, officials in Northwestern Mexico prepared equipment for power outages, closed schools, and evacuated 180 residents. [SEP] [CLS] Sandra's effects largely consisted of light to moderate rainfall; some traffic accidents and landslides resulted from this, though the overall impacts were limited. [SEP] [CLS]
