The 1963 Atlantic hurricane season featured one of the deadliest tropical cyclones on record in the Atlantic basin: Hurricane Flora. [CLS] [SEP] The season officially began on June 15, and lasted until November 15. [CLS] [SEP] These dates conventionally delimit the period of each year when most tropical cyclones form in the Atlantic basin. [CLS] [SEP] It was a near-average season in terms of tropical storms, with a total of nine named storms. [CLS] [SEP] The first system, Hurricane Arlene, developed between Cape Verde and the Lesser Antilles on July 31. [CLS] [SEP] The storm later impacted Bermuda, where strong winds resulted in about $300,000 (1963 USD) in damage. [CLS] [SEP] Other storms such as hurricanes Beulah and Debra, as well as an unnamed tropical storm, did not impact land. [CLS] [SEP] During the month of September, Hurricane Cindy caused wind damage and flooding in Texas, leaving three deaths and approximately $12.5 million in damage. [CLS] [SEP] Hurricane Edith passed through the Lesser Antilles and the eastern Greater Antilles, causing 10 deaths and about $43 million in damage, most of which occurred on Martinique. [CLS] [SEP] The most significant storm of the season was Hurricane Flora, which peaked as a Category 4 hurricane on the Saffirâ€“Simpson hurricane wind scale. [CLS] [SEP] Drifting slowly and executing a cyclonic loop, Flora dropped very heavy rainfall in the Greater Antilles, including over 100 in (2,500 mm) in Cuba. [CLS] [SEP] Extreme flooding ensued, leaving behind at least 7,193 fatalities and about $773.4 million in damage. [CLS] [SEP] Flora is thus listed among the deadliest Atlantic hurricanes on record. [CLS] [SEP] In October, Hurricane Ginny moved erratically offshore the Southeastern United States, though eventually, the extratropical remnants struck Nova Scotia. [CLS] [SEP] Ginny caused at least three deaths and $400,000 in damage in the United States alone. [CLS] [SEP] The final cyclone, Tropical Storm Helena, caused five deaths and over $500,000 in damage on Guadeloupe. [CLS] [SEP] Overall, the storms in this season caused at least 7,214 deaths and about $830.1 million in damage. [CLS] [SEP]
