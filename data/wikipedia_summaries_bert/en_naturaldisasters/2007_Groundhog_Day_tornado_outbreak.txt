The 2007 Groundhog Day tornado outbreak was a localized but devastating tornado event that took place in central Florida early on February 2, 2007. [CLS] [SEP] Early morning temperatures had risen well above average for the season; combined with increased moisture and a powerful jet stream, this created enough instability and wind shear for thunderstorms to rotate and spawn tornadoes. [CLS] [SEP] Due to the conditions, a long-tracked supercell formed and produced three tornadoes over one hour and seventeen minutes. [CLS] [SEP] The supercell resulted in a 70-mile (110-kilometer) trail of damage. [CLS] [SEP] Twenty-one people were killed and 76 others were injured in the outbreak. [CLS] [SEP] The first tornado damaged 1,145 homes and destroyed 200 others in Sumter County before hitting the Lady Lake area where it killed eight people. [CLS] [SEP] A total of 180 homes were damaged and 101 homes were destroyed in Lake County. [CLS] [SEP] The second tornado killed 13 people in the Lake Mack area and damaged or destroyed over 500 homes and other structures during its existence, including the 1500-foot (450-meter) tall transmission tower of WCFB FM. [CLS] [SEP] The final tornado damaged roofs, car ports and garage doors along its path through New Smyrna Beach. [CLS] [SEP] The outbreak was the second-deadliest on record for Florida, with damages of $218 million. [CLS] [SEP]
