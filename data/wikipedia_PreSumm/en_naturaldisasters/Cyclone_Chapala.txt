[CLS] Extremely Severe Cyclonic Storm Chapala was a powerful tropical cyclone that caused moderate damage in Somalia and Yemen during November 2015. [SEP] [CLS] Chapala was the third named storm of the 2015 North Indian Ocean cyclone season. [SEP] [CLS] It developed as a depression on 28 October off western India, and strengthened a day later into a cyclonic storm. [SEP] [CLS] Chapala then rapidly intensified amid favorable conditions. [SEP] [CLS] On 30 October, the India Meteorological Department (IMD) estimated that Chapala attained peak three-minute sustained winds of 215 km/h (130 mph). [SEP] [CLS] The American-based Joint Typhoon Warning Center (JTWC) estimated sustained winds of 240 km/h (150 mph), making Chapala among the strongest cyclones on record in the Arabian Sea. [SEP] [CLS] After peak intensity, Chapala skirted the Yemeni island of Socotra on 1 November, becoming the first hurricane-force storm there since 1922. [SEP] [CLS] High winds and heavy rainfall resulted in an island-wide power outage, and severe damage was compounded by Cyclone Megh, which struck Yemen a week later. [SEP] [CLS] While Chapala encountered less favorable conditions after leaving Socotra, it maintained much of its intensity; upon entering the Gulf of Aden on 2 November, it became the strongest known cyclone in that body of water. [SEP] [CLS] Chapala brushed the northern coast of Somalia, killing tens of thousands of animals and wrecking 350 houses. [SEP] [CLS] Ahead of the cyclone's final landfall, widespread evacuations occurred across southeastern Yemen, including in areas controlled by al-Qaeda, amid the country's ongoing civil war. [SEP] [CLS] Early on 3 November, the storm made landfall near Mukalla, Yemen, as a very severe cyclonic storm and the strongest storm on record to strike the nation. [SEP] [CLS] Chapala weakened into a remnant low the next day over land. [SEP] [CLS] Several years' worth of heavy rainfall inundated coastal areas, damaging roads and hundreds of homes. [SEP] [CLS] Eight people died in Yemen, a low total credited to the evacuations, and another 65 were injured. [SEP] [CLS] After cyclones Chapala and Megh, several countries, non-government organizations, and agencies within the United Nations provided monetary and material assistance to Yemen. [SEP] [CLS] The country faced food and fuel shortages, and residual storm effects contributed to an outbreak of locusts and dengue fever, the latter of which killed seven people. [SEP] [CLS]
