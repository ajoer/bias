[CLS] Severe Tropical Cyclone Erica of March 2003 was a powerful cyclone that severely affected New Caledonia and was considered the worst to affect the country since Cyclone Beti. [SEP] [CLS] The system was the eighth cyclone and the fifth severe tropical cyclone of the 2002-03 South Pacific cyclone season. [SEP] [CLS] Cyclone Erica developed from a monsoonal trough on 4 March just off of Queensland. [SEP] [CLS] Originally, the storm moved slowly towards the east and then north early in its existence. [SEP] [CLS] However, increasing wind shear caused the storm to be degenerated into a tropical low. [SEP] [CLS] After conditions once again became more favorable for development, the remnants regenerated into a tropical cyclone on 10 March. [SEP] [CLS] Steadily intensifying, Erica reached peak intensity on 13 March as a Category 5 equivalent on the Australian intensity scale. [SEP] [CLS] On the same day Erica paralleled the coast of New Caledonia before making landfall on the southern end of the island at L'ÃŽle-des-Pins. [SEP] [CLS] However, at the same time the cyclone also entered an area with strong wind shear and thus began to weaken. [SEP] [CLS] After passing the island, an extratropical transition begun, weakening the cyclone as it moved towards the southeast. [SEP] [CLS] On 15 March, Erica completed its transition into an extratropical cyclone and later fully dissipated two days later. [SEP] [CLS] Cyclone Erica severely impacted the island nation of New Caledonia, causing intense winds and heavy rain. [SEP] [CLS] An estimated 892 families were affected by the cyclone on the island, and two people were killed. [SEP] [CLS] As many as 60% of people on the west coast lost power. [SEP] [CLS] On 17 March only 17 of the 66 secondary schools on the island were functioning. [SEP] [CLS] After the storm it was feared that the existing dengue fever epidemic on the island would spread. [SEP] [CLS] Erica caused $15 million (2003 USD) in damages, primarily on New Caledonia. [SEP] [CLS] Following the deaths and damage, the name "Erica" was later retired. [SEP] [CLS]
