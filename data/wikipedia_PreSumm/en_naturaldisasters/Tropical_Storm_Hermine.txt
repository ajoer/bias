[CLS] Tropical Storm Hermine was a near-hurricane strength tropical cyclone that brought widespread flooding from Guatemala northwards to Oklahoma in early September 2010. [SEP] [CLS] Though it was named in the western Gulf of Mexico, Hermine developed directly from the remnant low-pressure area associated with the short-lived Tropical Depression Eleven-E in the East Pacific. [SEP] [CLS] Together the two designated systems caused 52 direct deaths and roughly US$740 million in damage to crops and infrastructure, primarily in Guatemala. [SEP] [CLS] The precursor tropical depression formed on September 3 in the Gulf of Tehuantepec and neared tropical storm intensity before making landfall near Salina Cruz, Mexico the next day. [SEP] [CLS] Though the depression quickly weakened to a remnant low, the disturbance crossed the Isthmus of Tehuantepec and tracked north into the warm waters of the Gulf of Mexico, where it reorganized into a tropical cyclone once again on September 5. [SEP] [CLS] There, it quickly strengthened into a tropical storm before moving ashore near Matamoros, Mexico on September 7 as a high-end tropical storm. [SEP] [CLS] Over the next few days, Hermine weakened as it moved over the U.S. [SEP] [CLS] Southern Plains, eventually dissipating over Kansas on September 10. [SEP] [CLS] In the Eastern Pacific, Tropical Depression Eleven-E, along with moisture from a monsoonal flow, brought torrential rains to southern Mexico and Guatemala. [SEP] [CLS] At least 84 people were killed in the two countries and damage exceeded $500 million. [SEP] [CLS] In northern Mexico, the effects of Tropical Storm Hermine were limited. [SEP] [CLS] Further north, severe flooding affected large parts of Texas and Oklahoma, killing eight people and leaving at least $240 million in losses. [SEP] [CLS] Despite the deaths and damage, the name was not retired. [SEP] [CLS]
