[CLS] Typhoon Ophelia was a long-lived and powerful tropical cyclone that had devastating impacts on the small atoll of Ulithi in the Caroline Islands. [SEP] [CLS] Forming as a tropical depression on November 21, 1960 near Enewetak Atoll, the incipient cyclone struggled to develop. [SEP] [CLS] Moving haphazardly along an s-shaped track over the western Pacific Ocean, it degenerated into a disturbance two days later. [SEP] [CLS] By November 27, the system reorganized and was classified a tropical depression for a second time well to the southeast of Guam. [SEP] [CLS] Moving slowly west-southwest, it steadily intensified into a tropical storm later that day and further into a typhoon on November 29 as it gained a steady westward track. [SEP] [CLS] The following day, the eye of Ophelia passed directly over Ulithi atoll with winds estimated at 230 km/h (145 mph).Turning gradually to the north, the typhoon attained peak winds of 250 km/h (155 mph) on December 1. [SEP] [CLS] Maintaining strength as a powerful system for several days, the storm remained over open waters. [SEP] [CLS] By December 4, it began to weaken as upper-level winds became unfavorable and forced the cyclone to move northeast. [SEP] [CLS] Passing Japan well to the southeast that day, its large circulation brought increased winds to the Tokyo area and heavy rain and snow to parts of the nation. [SEP] [CLS] Ophelia soon underwent an extratropical transition as it raced over the open Pacific, completing this structural change by December 6. [SEP] [CLS] Its remnants later crossed the International Dateline and dissipated over the Gulf of Alaska on December 10. [SEP] [CLS] Ophelia devastated much of Ulithi during its passage, damaging or destroying most structures and killing two people. [SEP] [CLS] Agriculture across the area was decimated and geographic changes to coastlines were noted. [SEP] [CLS] In Ophelia's wake, dramatic societal changes in the Ulithian culture arose. [SEP] [CLS] Traditional values were abandoned in favor of more western ones, with younger individuals attaining a notable increase in power. [SEP] [CLS] The local King was disposed of shortly after the storm and a total change in authority took place. [SEP] [CLS] In addition to the severe impact in Ulithi, the typhoon was blamed for the deaths of five fishermen when their vessel collided with a coral reef. [SEP] [CLS] The name Ophelia was later retired, though unusually its removal was due to its meteorological significance due to its long track and prolonged time as a significant typhoon rather than for loss of life or damage.
