British Airways Flight 9, sometimes referred to by its callsign Speedbird 9 or as the Jakarta incident, was a scheduled British Airways flight from London Heathrow to Auckland, with stops in Bombay, Kuala Lumpur, Perth, and Melbourne. [CLS] [SEP] On 24 June 1982, the route was flown by the City of Edinburgh, a Boeing 747-200. [CLS] [SEP] The aircraft flew into a cloud of volcanic ash thrown up by the eruption of Mount Galunggung (approximately 110 miles (180 km) south-east of Jakarta, Indonesia), resulting in the failure of all four engines. [CLS] [SEP] The reason for the failure was not immediately apparent to the crew or air traffic control. [CLS] [SEP] The aircraft was diverted to Jakarta in the hope that enough engines could be restarted to allow it to land there. [CLS] [SEP] The aircraft glided out of the ash cloud, and all engines were restarted (although one failed again soon after), allowing the aircraft to land safely at the Halim Perdanakusuma Airport in Jakarta. [CLS] [SEP] The crew members of the accident segment had boarded the aircraft in Kuala Lumpur, while many of the passengers had been aboard since the flight began in London. [CLS] [SEP]
