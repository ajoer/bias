[CLS] Maximinus Thrax ("the Thracian") or Maximinus I (Gaius Julius Verus Maximinus; c. [SEP] [CLS] 173 â€“ May 238) was Roman emperor from 235 to 238. [SEP] [CLS] His father was an accountant in the governor's office and sprang from ancestors who were Carpi (a Dacian tribe), a people whom Diocletian would eventually drive from their ancient abode (in Dacia) and transfer to Pannonia (Roman Antiquities, book XXVIII, Ammianus Marcellinus). [SEP] [CLS] Maximinus was the commander of the Legio IV Italica when Severus Alexander was assassinated by his own troops in 235. [SEP] [CLS] The Pannonian army then elected Maximinus emperor.In 238 (which came to be known as the Year of the Six Emperors), a senatorial revolt broke out, leading to the successive proclamation of Gordian I, Gordian II, Pupienus, Balbinus and Gordian III as emperors in opposition to Maximinus. [SEP] [CLS] Maximinus advanced on Rome to put down the revolt, but was halted at Aquileia, where he was assassinated by disaffected elements of the Legio II Parthica. [SEP] [CLS] Maximinus is described by several ancient sources, though none are contemporary except Herodian's Roman History. [SEP] [CLS] He was a so-called barracks emperor of the 3rd century; his rule is often considered to mark the beginning of the Crisis of the Third Century. [SEP] [CLS] Maximinus was the first emperor who hailed neither from the senatorial class nor from the equestrian class. [SEP] [CLS]
