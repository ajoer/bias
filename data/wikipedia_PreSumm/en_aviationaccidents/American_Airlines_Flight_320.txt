[CLS] American Airlines Flight 320 was a scheduled flight between Chicago Midway International Airport and New York City's LaGuardia Airport. [SEP] [CLS] On February 3, 1959, the Lockheed L-188 Electra performing the flight crashed into the East River, killing 65 of the 73 people on board. [SEP] [CLS] Poor weather conditions at the destination meant that the crew had to descend through dense clouds and fog, but the aircraft flew lower than the pilots intended and it crashed into the icy river 4,900 feet (1,500 m) short of the runway at a speed of 140 knots (160 mph; 260 km/h). [SEP] [CLS] American Airlines had been flying the type of aircraft in commercial service for only about two weeks before the accident. [SEP] [CLS] Eyewitnesses to the accident reported that the aircraft was flying significantly lower than was normal for planes approaching the airport, while surviving flight crew members claimed that the aircraft's instruments had told them that the flight was operating at normal altitudes right up to the moment of impact. [SEP] [CLS] An investigation by the Civil Aeronautics Board concluded that mistakes by the flight crew, the flight crew's inexperience flying the type of aircraft, and poor weather conditions were the causes of the crash. [SEP] [CLS] The conclusion was challenged by the Air Line Pilots Association, who felt that the crash was caused by faulty instruments and poor weather conditions, not by any mistakes made by the highly experienced flight crew.
