[CLS] Anna Ehn (born 1931) is an Austrian Righteous Among the Nations. [SEP] [CLS] One day Anna was approached by a 13-year-old Jewish girl, Illona Friedman, on her way to Mass. [SEP] [CLS] She instantly offered food to the hungry child, and promised to do so every day. [SEP] [CLS] Ilona Friedman came to Vienna from Hungary in 1944, when she and her family were part of a transport of Jews. [SEP] [CLS] When the air strikes on Vienna intensified, children like her had to tidy up streets, and cemeteries, after bombings. [SEP] [CLS] Ilona and people like her had to beg for money, and food on the streets since they had nothing to eat and were hungry all the time. [SEP] [CLS] When Ilona's older sister was injured in a bombing and taken to a SS-hospital, she asked Anna Ehn to save her sister from deportation into a death camp. [SEP] [CLS] Eventually, Anna Ehn went to the hospital and got her will to take Ilona Friedman's sister home. [SEP] [CLS] Anna looked after the girl and eventually saved her life. [SEP] [CLS] She was rewarded "Righteous Among the Nations" by the Yad Vashem Institute. [SEP] [CLS]
