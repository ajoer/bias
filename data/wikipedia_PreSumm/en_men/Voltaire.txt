[CLS] Voltage, electric potential difference, electric pressure or electric tension is the difference in electric potential between two points, which (in a static electric field) is defined as the work needed per unit of charge to move a test charge between the two points. [SEP] [CLS] In the International System of Units, the derived unit for voltage (potential difference) is named volt. [SEP] [CLS] In SI units, work per unit charge is expressed as joules per coulomb, where 1 volt = 1 joule (of work) per 1 coulomb (of charge). [SEP] [CLS] The old SI definition for volt used power and current, since 1990 quantum Hall and Josephson effect were used and recently (2019) fundamental physical constants were introduced for the definition of all SI units and derived units. [SEP] [CLS] Voltage or electric potential difference is denoted symbolically by âˆ†V, simplified V, or U, for instance in the context of Ohm's or Kirchhoff's circuit laws. [SEP] [CLS] Electric potential differences between points can be caused by electric charge, by electric current through a magnetic field, by time-varying magnetic fields, or some combination of these three. [SEP] [CLS] A voltmeter can be used to measure the voltage (or potential difference) between two points in a system; often a common reference potential such as the ground of the system is used as one of the points. [SEP] [CLS] A voltage may represent either a source of energy (electromotive force) or lost, used, or stored energy (potential drop). [SEP] [CLS]
