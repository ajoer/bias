Hurricane Debby caused minor damage in the Greater and Lesser Antilles in August 2000. [CLS] [SEP] The seventh tropical cyclone, fourth named storm, and second hurricane of the annual season, Debby developed from a tropical wave east of the Lesser Antilles on August 19. [CLS] [SEP] Favorable conditions allowed the depression to become Tropical Storm Debby early on August 20, and further strengthening into a hurricane occurred 24 hours later. [CLS] [SEP] Sustained winds peaked at 85 mph (140 km/h) on August 21. [CLS] [SEP] Debby made three landfalls on August 22, in Barbuda, Saint Barth√©lemy, and Virgin Gorda, before re-entering the Atlantic north of Puerto Rico. [CLS] [SEP] As Debby moved parallel to the north coast of Hispaniola late on August 23, it weakened back to a tropical storm. [CLS] [SEP] The storm tracked westward and weakened further, instead of approaching Florida and strengthening into a major hurricane. [CLS] [SEP] While south of eastern Cuba on August 24, Debby was downgraded to a tropical depression, six hours before completely dissipating. [CLS] [SEP] Light rainfall and gusty winds caused minor damage in Barbuda, Saint Martin, and Trinidad and Tobago. [CLS] [SEP] In the United States Virgin Islands, brief blackouts and damage reaching $200,000 (2000 USD) was reported. [CLS] [SEP] Effects were most severe in Puerto Rico, where isolated locations experienced more than 12 inches (300 mm) of rainfall. [CLS] [SEP] The heavy precipitation resulted in mudslides and flooding, which in turn damaged roads, bridges, and houses. [CLS] [SEP] At least 406 homes on the island were flooded, five of which suffered moderate to severe damage. [CLS] [SEP] Additionally, there were many car accidents in San Juan due to slick roads. [CLS] [SEP] One indirectly fatality was reported after a man fell off his roof while attempting to remove a satellite dish. [CLS] [SEP] Damage on the island of Puerto Rico reached $501,000. [CLS] [SEP] In Dominican Republic, the Civil Defense Force reported that severe flooding in the northern portions of that country caused the evacuation of more than 700 people. [CLS] [SEP] Overall, the storm caused roughly $35,000 in damage across the island. [CLS] [SEP] Impact was lesser in Haiti, where squalls tore tin roofs off of numerous shanty homes and subsequently flooded a few. [CLS] [SEP] Additionally, rainfall in Cuba brought relief to an 8 month long drought impacting the region. [CLS] [SEP]
