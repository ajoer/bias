Tropical Cyclone Alan was considered to be one of the worst natural disasters experienced in French Polynesia. [CLS] [SEP] The system, first noted as a tropical disturbance on April 17, 1998 east of the Northern Cook Islands, initially moved erratically prior to its designation as Alan upon developing into a tropical cyclone on April 21. [CLS] [SEP] The following day, Alan reached its estimated peak intensity with 10-minute maximum sustained wind speeds of 75 km/h (45 mph), posing several forecasting challenges due to difficulties in establishing its location and intensity. [CLS] [SEP] On April 23, Alan appeared to become sheared with the low-level circulation center displaced about 20 km (10 mi) from the nearest atmospheric convection. [CLS] [SEP] However, over the next day, after the mid-level trough of low pressure shearing the system moved faster than expected, Alan became better organized. [CLS] [SEP] While situated about 555 km (345 mi) west-northwest of the French Polynesian island of Tahiti, the system drifted south-southeastward. [CLS] [SEP] Early on April 25, Alan passed near to or over the French Polynesian Society Islands of Maupiti, Bora-Bora, and Raiatea. [CLS] [SEP] However, strong wind shear pulled the system apart, with visible imagery confirming the system's degeneration into a depression with a fully exposed low-level circulation. [CLS] [SEP] The system affected French Polynesia with high winds and torrential rain, causing several landslides on the Society Islands. [CLS] [SEP] The landslides resulted in the collapse of two bridges, and also overturned trees, in turn obstructing roads. [CLS] [SEP] Overall, ten people died as a result of the system, while thirty others were injured, with a majority of the casualties a result of landslides. [CLS] [SEP] On the islands of Raiatea, Taha'a and Huahine, several churches, schools and clinics were damaged, while water and electricity supplies were cut off. [CLS] [SEP] On the islands, around 750 houses were destroyed, with 430 and 150 wrecked on Huahine and Ra'iƒÅtea, respectively. [CLS] [SEP]
