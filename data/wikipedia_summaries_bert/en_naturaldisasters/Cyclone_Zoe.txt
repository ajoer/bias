Severe Tropical Cyclone Zoe was the second-most intense tropical cyclone on record within the Southern Hemisphere. [CLS] [SEP] The system was first noted on December 23, 2002 as a tropical depression that had developed, within the South Pacific Convergence Zone to the east of Tuvalu. [CLS] [SEP] Over the next couple of days the system moved south-westwards and crossed the International Dateline early on December 25. [CLS] [SEP] After this the system became better organized and was declared to be a tropical cyclone and named Zoe later that day. [CLS] [SEP] Zoe subsequently rapidly intensified in very favorable conditions as it continued to move west-southwest towards the Solomon Islands. [CLS] [SEP] The system subsequently became a Category 5 tropical cyclone on both the Australian tropical cyclone intensity scale and the Saffir-Simpson hurricane wind scale on December 27. [CLS] [SEP] The system subsequently affected the Solomon Islands Temotu Province during that day, before it peaked with 10-minute sustained wind speeds of 240 km/h (150 mph). [CLS] [SEP] As the system peaked, it performed a small clockwise cyclonic loop within the vicinity of Tikopia island, as a result of the steering flow over the cyclone becoming weak and variable. [CLS] [SEP] The system subsequently started to move towards the southeast during December 29, in response to a strengthening steering flow, provided by an upper level trough of low pressure and a baroclinic system near New Caledonia. [CLS] [SEP] Over the next few days the system weakened and degenerated into a tropical depression during January 1, 2003. [CLS] [SEP] The system was subsequently last noted during January 4, while it was located to the southeast of New Caledonia. [CLS] [SEP] Cyclone Zoe severely affected areas of Rotuma, the Solomon Islands, and Vanuatu. [CLS] [SEP] Heavy rainfall and strong winds were particularly disastrous to the Solomon Islands, especially on the islands of Anuta and Tikopia. [CLS] [SEP] There, numerous crops and fruitâ€“bearing trees were destroyed. [CLS] [SEP] Beaches were also heavily eroded due to the high waves generated by the cyclone. [CLS] [SEP] Although effects were lesser in Vanuatu, the country's northernmost islands experienced heavy flooding and beaches destroyed by high waves. [CLS] [SEP] After this usage of the name Zoe, the name was retired. [CLS] [SEP]
