Severe Tropical Cyclone Rona–Frank (JTWC designations: 20P, 22P; RSMC Nadi designation: 16F) was the only tropical cyclone to threaten Queensland during the 1998–99 Australian region cyclone season. [CLS] [SEP] Rona-Frank originated from a low that developed on 9 February about 225 km (140 mi) to the northeast of Cairns. [CLS] [SEP] Over the next couple of days, the low slowly developed further before it was upgraded into a Category 1 cyclone on the Australian intensity scale by the Australian Bureau of Meteorology on 10 February as it started to move towards the southwest. [CLS] [SEP] Subsequently, Rona rapidly intensified just before making landfall near the Cape York Peninsula. [CLS] [SEP] While the low-level circulation became difficult to locate on 12 February, the upper-level circulation eventually emerged into the Coral Sea and later regenerated into Tropical Cyclone Frank. [CLS] [SEP] The system rapidly intensified before making landfall on New Caledonia as a Category 2 cyclone on the Saffir-Simpson Hurricane Scale in the early morning hours of 20 February. [CLS] [SEP] Frank was re-classified as an extratropical cyclone the next day. [CLS] [SEP] Seven deaths were reported from Rona and a state of disaster was declared. [CLS] [SEP] Over 2,000 fled their homes due to flooding and many residents were caught off-guard for the storm. [CLS] [SEP] Significant crop damage was reported. [CLS] [SEP] Overall, Rona brought $150 million (1999 USD) in damage to Queensland. [CLS] [SEP] Minor damage was reported in New Caledonia. [CLS] [SEP] After the season, the name "Rona" was retired from the list of tropical cyclone names. [CLS] [SEP]
