The 1954 Bjørnøya Consolidated PBY Catalina crash (Norwegian: Bjørnøya-ulykken) was a controlled flight into terrain (CFIT) of a Consolidated PBY Catalina on the island of Bjørnøya in Svalbard, Norway, on 28 March 1954 at ca. [CLS] [SEP] 15:00. [CLS] [SEP] The Royal Norwegian Air Force aircraft of No. [CLS] [SEP] 333 Squadron RNoAF (333 Sqn) was conducting a postal drop flight from Tromsø to five settlements on Svalbard, including Bjørnøya Radio, making a low pass over Bjørnøya at a height of 40 meters (130 ft) before crashing into the ground. [CLS] [SEP] Only one of the nine on board survived. [CLS] [SEP] The crew at the station set out to find the aircraft in 3 ft (1 m) of snow, and did not manage to bring the survivor back to the station until the following day. [CLS] [SEP] Four military ships were dispatched to search for the aircraft. [CLS] [SEP] Once it was found, Andenes and Sørøy returned to Tromsø and then took the investigation commission to Bjørnøya. [CLS] [SEP] They concluded that the accident was caused by the aircraft losing altitude through a sideslip, possibly due to the pilot losing spatial awareness in the poor visibility. [CLS] [SEP]
