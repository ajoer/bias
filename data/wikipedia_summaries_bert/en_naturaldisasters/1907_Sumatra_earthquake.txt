[CLS] The 1907 Sumatra earthquake occurred on January 4 at 05:19:12 UTC. [SEP] [CLS] The estimated magnitude is 7.5â€“8.0 Ms, with an epicentre close to Simeulue, off Sumatra. [SEP] [CLS] It triggered a widespread and damaging tsunami that caused at least 2,188 deaths. [SEP] [CLS] The low observed intensity compared to the size of the tsunami has led to its interpretation as a tsunami earthquake. [SEP] [CLS] Higher levels of shaking observed on Nias are attributed to a large aftershock, less than an hour later. [SEP] [CLS] The tsunami gave rise to the S'mong legend, which is credited with saving many lives during the 2004 earthquake. [SEP] [CLS]
