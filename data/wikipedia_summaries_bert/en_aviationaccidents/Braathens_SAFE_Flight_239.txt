Braathen SAFE Flight 239, also known as the Asker Accident (Norwegian: Asker-ulykken), was a controlled flight into terrain of a Fokker F28 Fellowship into Vestmarka in Asker, Norway, on 23 December 1972 at 16:33. [CLS] [SEP] The Braathens SAFE aircraft was en route on a scheduled flight from Ã…lesund Airport, Vigra and crashed during approach to Oslo Airport, Fornebu. [CLS] [SEP] Forty of the forty-five people on board the aircraft were killed, making it the deadliest civil aviation accident in Norway until Vnukovo Airlines Flight 2801 in 1996. [CLS] [SEP] According to Norwegian newspaper Dagbladet 23 December 1992, a Danish citizen died of late complications in 1976. [CLS] [SEP] The pilots took a short-cut during approach on runway 06 at Fornebu. [CLS] [SEP] Combined with false signals from the instrument landing system (ILS), this caused the pilots to misunderstand their location. [CLS] [SEP] This in turn led them to take an incorrect landing path, causing the plane to hit ground in a hilly area. [CLS] [SEP] The rescue operation was initiated almost immediately, but it took six and a half hours to find the aircraft. [CLS] [SEP] Three years later, the investigation commission concluded that various measures should be put in place to improve navigation, to avoid similar situations in which pilots misunderstood their location.
