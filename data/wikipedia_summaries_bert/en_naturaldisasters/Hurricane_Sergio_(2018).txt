Hurricane Sergio was a powerful and long-lived tropical cyclone that affected the Baja California Peninsula as a tropical storm and caused significant flooding throughout southern Texas in early October 2018. [CLS] [SEP] Sergio became the eighth Category 4 hurricane in the East Pacific for 2018, breaking the old record of seven set in 2015. [CLS] [SEP] The twentieth named storm, eleventh hurricane, and ninth major hurricane of the season, Sergio originated from a system that was located over northwestern South America on September 24. [CLS] [SEP] The National Hurricane Center monitored the disturbance for several days as the system organized into a tropical storm on September 29. [CLS] [SEP] Sergio gradually strengthened for the next couple of days as it traveled west-southwestward, becoming a hurricane on October 2. [CLS] [SEP] The storm then turned towards the northwest as it underwent rapid intensification and an eyewall replacement cycle, before peaking as a Category 4 hurricane on October 4, with maximum sustained winds of 140 mph (220 km/h). [CLS] [SEP] The hurricane maintained peak intensity for 12 hours before undergoing a second eyewall replacement and turning towards the southwest. [CLS] [SEP] The system then began another period of intensification, achieving a secondary peak with winds of 125 mph (205 km/h) on October 6. [CLS] [SEP] The next day, Sergio began a third eyewall replacement cycle, falling below major hurricane strength. [CLS] [SEP] At the same time, the system unexpectedly assumed some annular characteristics. [CLS] [SEP] Over the next few days, the cyclone curved from the southwest to the northeast, weakening into a tropical storm on October 9. [CLS] [SEP] Sergio made landfall as a tropical storm on October 12 on the Baja California Peninsula, and later in northwestern Mexico as a tropical depression before dissipating early on October 13. [CLS] [SEP] Sergio's approach warranted the issuance of tropical storm watches, and warnings along the western and eastern coasts of Baja California from October 10â€“11. [CLS] [SEP] The cyclone made landfall in western Baja California Sur and Sonora on October 13 as a tropical storm and tropical depression, respectively, causing over US$2 million1 in damage, over a thousand school closures, and a few hundred evacuations due to severe flooding. [CLS] [SEP] Sergio's remnants brought heavy rainfall to Arizona, resulting in the closure of its state fair. [CLS] [SEP] Multiple tornadoes also spawned in Texas as a result of the increased moisture. [CLS] [SEP] About US$548,000 in damage occurred throughout both states. [CLS] [SEP] No injuries or deaths were reported in association with the hurricane or its remnants. [CLS] [SEP]
