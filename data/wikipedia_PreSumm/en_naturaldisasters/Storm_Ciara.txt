[CLS] Storm Ciara, was a powerful and long-lived extratropical cyclone that was the first of a pair of European windstorms to impact the United Kingdom and Ireland at peak intensity less than a week apart, followed later by Storm Dennis. [SEP] [CLS] Ciara caused widespread wind and flooding damage across Europe, and at least 13 fatalities. [SEP] [CLS] The system emerged into the North Atlantic and underwent rapid intensification; the first severe weather warnings were issued for the United Kingdom and Ireland on 4 February well in advance of the storm's arrival, and it was officially named Ciara by the Met Office the following day, becoming the twelfth named storm of the 2019–20 European windstorm season. [SEP] [CLS] Ciara subsequently made landfall in northern Scotland on 9 February and Norway the next day. [SEP] [CLS] Precursor low Kade brought heavy snowfall to the northern United States and eastern Canada, especially Newfoundland, New England and New York; further south in the Mid-Atlantic and Southeastern U.S., flooding and tornadoes were reported. [SEP] [CLS] The worst effects from Ciara were felt in Ireland and the United Kingdom, where the storm arrived over the weekend of 8–9 February, bringing high winds and heavy rainfall that caused severe damage, widespread flooding and three fatalities in the latter country. [SEP] [CLS] As Ciara moved across northern Europe with an unusually large wind field, eight further fatalities were recorded in a wide range of countries in mainland Europe, including as far away as Slovenia.
