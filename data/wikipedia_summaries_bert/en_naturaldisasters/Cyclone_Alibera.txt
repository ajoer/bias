Cyclone Alibera was the second longest-lasting tropical cyclone on record in the south-west Indian Ocean, with a duration of 22 days. [CLS] [SEP] It formed on December 16, 1989, well to the northeast of Madagascar. [CLS] [SEP] For several days, it meandered southwestward while gradually intensifying. [CLS] [SEP] On December 20, Alibera intensified to tropical cyclone status with 10‑minute maximum sustained winds of 120 km/h (75 mph), or the equivalent of a minimal hurricane. [CLS] [SEP] That day, the Météo-France office in Réunion (MFR) estimated 10‑minute winds of 140 km/h (85 mph), while the Joint Typhoon Warning Center (JTWC), an unofficial warning agency for the region, estimated peak 1‑minute winds of 250 km/h (150 mph). [CLS] [SEP] After drifting erratically for several days, the storm began a steady southwest motion on December 29 as a greatly weakened system. [CLS] [SEP] On January 1, Alibera struck southeastern Madagascar near Mananjary, having re-intensified to just below tropical cyclone status. [CLS] [SEP] It weakened over land but again restrengthened upon reaching open waters on January 3. [CLS] [SEP] The storm turned to the southeast, then to the southwest, and finally back to the southeast, dissipating on January 5. [CLS] [SEP] Early in its duration, Alibera produced gusty winds in the Seychelles. [CLS] [SEP] Upon moving ashore in Madagascar, the cyclone lashed coastal cities with heavy rainfall and up to 250-km/h (150-mph) wind gusts. [CLS] [SEP] In Mananjary, nearly every building was damaged or destroyed, and locals considered it the worst storm since 1925. [CLS] [SEP] Across the region, the cyclone destroyed large areas of crops, thousands of houses, and several roads and bridges. [CLS] [SEP] Alibera killed 46 people and left 55,346 people homeless. [CLS] [SEP] After the storm, the Malagasy government requested for international assistance. [CLS] [SEP]
