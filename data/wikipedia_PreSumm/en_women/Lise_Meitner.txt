[CLS] Lise Meitner (; German: [liː.zə ˈmaɪ̯t.nɐ] (listen); 7 November 1878 – 27 October 1968) was an Austrian-Swedish physicist who contributed to the discoveries of an element protactinium and nuclear fission. [SEP] [CLS] While working at the Kaiser Wilhelm Institute on radioactivity, she discovered protactinium (specifically protactinium-231) as a radioactive isotope in 1917. [SEP] [CLS] Soon after fleeing from Nazi Germany to Sweden in 1938, she and nephew-physicist Otto Robert Frisch discovered nuclear fission. [SEP] [CLS] She was praised by Albert Einstein as the "German Marie Curie".Completing her doctoral research in 1905, Meitner became the first female from the University of Vienna and second in the world to earn a doctorate in physics. [SEP] [CLS] Meitner spent most of her scientific career in Berlin, Germany, where she was a physics professor and a department head at the Kaiser Wilhelm Institute; she was the first woman to become a full professor of physics in Germany. [SEP] [CLS] She lost these positions in the 1930s because of the anti-Jewish Nuremberg Laws of Nazi Germany, and in 1938 she fled to Sweden, where she lived for many years, ultimately becoming a Swedish citizen. [SEP] [CLS] In mid-1938, Meitner with chemists Otto Hahn and Fritz Strassmann at the Kaiser Wilhelm Institute found that bombarding thorium with neutrons produced different isotopes. [SEP] [CLS] Hahn and Strassmann later in the year showed that isotopes of barium could be formed by bombardment of uranium. [SEP] [CLS] In late December, Meitner and Frisch quickly worked out the phenomenon of such splitting process. [SEP] [CLS] In their report in February issue of Nature in 1939, they gave the name "fission". [SEP] [CLS] This principle led to the development of the first atomic bomb during World War II, and the subsequently other nuclear weapons and nuclear reactors. [SEP] [CLS] Meitner received many awards and honours late in her life, but did not share in the 1944 Nobel Prize in Chemistry for nuclear fission, which was awarded exclusively to her long-time collaborator Otto Hahn. [SEP] [CLS] Several scientists and journalists have called her exclusion "unjust". [SEP] [CLS] However, Meitner received many posthumous honours, including the naming of chemical element 109 meitnerium in 1997. [SEP] [CLS] According to the Nobel Prize archive, she was nominated 19 times for Nobel Prize in Chemistry between 1924 and 1948, and 29 times for Nobel Prize in Physics between 1937 and 1965. [SEP] [CLS] Despite not having been awarded the Nobel Prize, Meitner was invited to attend the Lindau Nobel Laureate Meeting in 1962. [SEP] [CLS]
