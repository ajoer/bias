Severe Tropical Cyclone Gillian was the second most powerful of the 2013–14 Australian region cyclone season and the strongest in the basin in four years. [CLS] [SEP] It developed on 8 March, 2014, in the Gulf of Carpentaria offshore northern Australia. [CLS] [SEP] It drifted southeastward, moving over northwestern Queensland on 10 March as a weak tropical cyclone, and subsequently turned to the southwest and later to the west. [CLS] [SEP] Unfavourable wind shear, land interaction, and dry air prevented much restrengthening, and for several days Gillian was a weak tropical low. [CLS] [SEP] The storm moved northward and curved westward around the Top End of northwestern Australia, and subsequently moved across several islands in Indonesia, first Timor on 18 March. [CLS] [SEP] On 21 March, Gillian again became a tropical cyclone as it moved away from Indonesia. [CLS] [SEP] On the next day, it passed just southeast of Christmas Island as an intensifying storm, and subsequently Gillian underwent rapid deepening. [CLS] [SEP] On 23 March, the Bureau of Meteorology (BoM) estimated peak 10-minute sustained winds of 220 km/h (140 mph). [CLS] [SEP] On the same day, the Joint Typhoon Warning Center (JTWC) estimated peak 1-minute sustained winds of 260 km/h (160 mph), making it a Category 5 on the Saffir–Simpson hurricane wind scale. [CLS] [SEP] Increased wind shear caused the cyclone to rapidly weaken, and both BoM and JTWC discontinued advisories on Gillian on 26 March. [CLS] [SEP] The cyclone affected northern Australia with gusty winds and some rainfall, while on the Indonesian island of Java, it produced strong waves. [CLS] [SEP] While moving near Christmas Island, Gillian downed thousands of trees and damaged the roof of one of the oldest buildings on the island. [CLS] [SEP] Winds gusted to 96 km/h (60 mph), making it the first cyclone to affect Christmas Island in six years. [CLS] [SEP] The storm also affected the search for missing Malaysia Airlines Flight 370. [CLS] [SEP]
