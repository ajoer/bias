Hurricane Francelia was the deadliest hurricane of the 1969 Atlantic hurricane season after causing significant flooding to Central America, especially Belize and Guatemala. [CLS] [SEP] The sixth named storm and fourth hurricane of the season, Francelia developed from a tropical wave in the southeastern Caribbean Sea on August 29. [CLS] [SEP] It moved west-northwestward and strengthened into a tropical storm on the following day. [CLS] [SEP] On September 1, Francelia reached hurricane status, shortly before re-curving west-southwest. [CLS] [SEP] While approaching Central America, the storm intensified and peaked as a 115 mph (185 km/h) Category 3 hurricane on September 2. [CLS] [SEP] Francelia weakened slightly before making landfall near Punta Gorda, Belize (then British Honduras) late on September 3. [CLS] [SEP] The storm quickly weakened inland and dissipated by the following day. [CLS] [SEP] During its early stages, Francelia brought gusty winds and light rainfall to several islands in the Caribbean Sea. [CLS] [SEP] While remaining nearly stationary offshore Central America, heavy precipitation fell in some countries, especially Guatemala where severe flooding killed 269 people and caused $15 million in damage. [CLS] [SEP] In neighboring Honduras, the hurricane struck after the undeclared Football War, causing additional damage in the northern portions of the country. [CLS] [SEP] Damage in Honduras was heaviest on the offshore Bay Islands, and the hurricane damaged or destroyed the majority of two towns there. [CLS] [SEP] In El Salvador, flooding isolated towns for several days and caused crop damage. [CLS] [SEP] Several rivers in the region flooded, with the Belize River reaching 36 feet (11 m) above normal. [CLS] [SEP] Coastal areas of Belize lost electricity and telephone service, and high winds resulted in extensive damage to banana crops.
