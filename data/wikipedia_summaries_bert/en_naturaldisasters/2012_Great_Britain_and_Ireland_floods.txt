The 2012 Great Britain and Ireland floods were a series of weather events that affected parts of Great Britain and Ireland periodically during the course of 2012 and on through the winter into 2013. [CLS] [SEP] The beginning of 2012 saw much of the United Kingdom experiencing droughts and a heat wave in March. [CLS] [SEP] A series of low pressure systems steered by the jet stream brought the wettest April in 100 years, and flooding across Britain and Ireland. [CLS] [SEP] Continuing through May and leading to the wettest beginning to June in 150 years, with flooding and extreme events occurring periodically throughout Britain and parts of Atlantic Europe. [CLS] [SEP] On 27 and 28 June and again on 7 July heavy rain events occurred from powerful thunderstorms that gathered strength as they travelled across mainland Britain. [CLS] [SEP] Severe weather warnings and a number of flood alerts were issued by the UK's Environment Agency, and many areas were hit by flash floods that overwhelmed properties and caused power cuts. [CLS] [SEP] A motorist was killed after his vehicle was caught by floodwater and landslides halted rail services between England and Scotland. [CLS] [SEP] The thunderstorms were the product of two fronts that collided over the British Isles â€“ warm air travelling from the Azores and cold water-ladened air from the west. [CLS] [SEP] The second batch of flooding struck the South-West of England during the afternoon of 7 July, forcing the Met Office to issue its highest alert, Red (Take Action), due to the significant amounts of rainfall caused by a system travelling from Southern Europe, along with the warm, humid air the United Kingdom had seen in the run-up to the floods, which, like the June floods, caused thunderstorms. [CLS] [SEP] During the Autumn the most intense September low since 1981 brought widespread flooding and wind damage to the UK. [CLS] [SEP] Widespread flooding occurred again in November, December and January 2013, as more heavy rains overwhelmed the saturated ground. [CLS] [SEP]
