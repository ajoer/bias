[CLS] A bomb hidden in a suitcase transiting through New Tokyo International Airport exploded at 06:19 (UTC) 23 June 1985 in a baggage handling room, killing two baggage handlers and injuring another four. [SEP] [CLS] It had come from Vancouver, Canada through Canadian Pacific Flight 003 and was transiting through the airport for Air India Flight 301 to Bangkok, Thailand. [SEP] [CLS] It was believed that Sikh extremists wished for the bomb to explode at the same time as another bombing just one hour later of Air India Flight 182 over the Atlantic Ocean off the west coast of Ireland, but had failed to account for daylight saving time. [SEP] [CLS] The bomb inadvertently had exploded even earlier than what the perpetrators had planned due to being manhandled at the airport. [SEP] [CLS] If the plan had worked, then the bomb would have exploded inside Air India Flight 301 instead of the airport. [SEP] [CLS] Extensive analysis by the Japanese investigators identified bomb parts through serial numbers and narrowed the pieces to less than 2000 possible electronic tuners of an older model shipped to Vancouver, allowing Canadian police to identify a single person who had bought this older model recently. [SEP] [CLS] At the same time in the inquiry to the Air India Flight 182 bombing, investigators had identified that the man checked-in luggage without boarding the plane. [SEP] [CLS] Canadian investigators believe that Sikh extremists living in Canada are believed to be responsible for both bombings, but only Inderjit Singh Reyat, who lived in Duncan, British Columbia, was convicted in Canadian court. [SEP] [CLS] He was found guilty in 1991 in the Narita bombing. [SEP] [CLS] In 2003, shortly before the start of the Air India trial, he made a plea bargain on reduced charges and a promise of testimony against other suspects. [SEP] [CLS] He made the bombs used in both attacks. [SEP] [CLS]
