[CLS] Severe Tropical Cyclone Kathy was a powerful tropical cyclone that devastated the Sir Edward Pellew Group of Islands in March 1984. [SEP] [CLS] Originating from a tropical low off the southern coast of Papua New Guinea. [SEP] [CLS] Tracking westward, the system attained gale-force winds by 18 March before striking the Cape York Peninsula. [SEP] [CLS] After crossing the area, Kathy entered the Gulf of Carpentaria where environmental conditions favoured significant development. [SEP] [CLS] On 22 March, the storm attained its peak intensity as a Category 5 severe tropical cyclone (Australian tropical cyclone intensity scale) with ten-minute sustained winds of 205 km/h (125 mph). [SEP] [CLS] By this time, the storm had been tracking towards the southwest and struck the Sir Edward Pellew Group of Islands later on 22 March before moving over the Australian mainland as a slightly weaker system. [SEP] [CLS] Once over land, Kathy rapidly degraded, losing gale-force winds within 24 hours; the storm dissipated over the Northern Territory on 24 March. [SEP] [CLS] Moving through the Pellew Islands as a powerful cyclone, Kathy generated a maximum storm surge of 4.2 m (14 ft) and winds exceeding 232 km/h (144 mph). [SEP] [CLS] Offshore, 20 vessels were affected, one of which sank and resulted in the death of its captain. [SEP] [CLS] In mainland Australia, the system struck a relatively sparsely populated area, with only Borroloola being significantly impacted by the cyclone. [SEP] [CLS] Additionally, mangroves at along the McArthur River sustained substantial damage. [SEP] [CLS] Overall, losses from the storm were placed at A$12 million (A$30.5 million 2011 AUD; US$24.1 million 2011 USD). [SEP] [CLS] Following its usage, the name Kathy was retired and will never be used again to name an Australian cyclone. [SEP] [CLS]
