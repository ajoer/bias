[CLS] Emperor Ai of Tang (27 October 892 – 26 March 908), also known as Emperor Zhaoxuan (昭宣帝), born Li Zuo, later known as Li Chu (Chinese: 李柷; pinyin: Lǐ Chù), was the last emperor of the Tang dynasty of China. [SEP] [CLS] He reigned—as but a puppet ruler—from 904 to 907. [SEP] [CLS] Emperor Ai was the son of Emperor Zhaozong. [SEP] [CLS] Emperor Ai ascended the throne at the age of 11 after his father, the Emperor Zhaozong, was assassinated on the orders of the paramount warlord Zhu Quanzhong in 904, and while Emperor Ai reigned, the Tang court, then at Luoyang, was under the control of officials Zhu put in charge. [SEP] [CLS] In 905, under the instigation of his associates Liu Can and Li Zhen, Zhu had Emperor Ai issue an edict summoning some 30 senior aristocrats at Baima Station (白馬驛, in modern Anyang, Henan), near the Yellow River; the aristocrats were thereafter ordered to commit suicide, and their bodies were thrown into the Yellow River. [SEP] [CLS] He could do nothing to stop Zhu from murdering his brothers and mother in the same year. [SEP] [CLS] Less than two years later in 907, Zhu made his final move against Emperor Ai himself, forcing the young emperor to abdicate to him. [SEP] [CLS] In Zhu's new Later Liang, the former Tang emperor carried the title of Prince of Jiyin, but in 908, Zhu had the prince poisoned, at the age of 15. [SEP] [CLS]
