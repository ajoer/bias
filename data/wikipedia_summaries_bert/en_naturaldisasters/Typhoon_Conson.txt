Typhoon Conson, known in the Philippines as Typhoon Basyang, was the second tropical cyclone during the 2010 Pacific typhoon season to impact the Philippines. [CLS] [SEP] Developing out of a tropical disturbance east of the Philippines on July 11, 2010, Conson quickly developed as it tracked nearly due west. [CLS] [SEP] Favorable environmental conditions, such as low wind shear and warm sea surface temperatures, allowed the system to intensify into a severe tropical storm by July 12. [CLS] [SEP] Around the same time, the JTWC assessed the storm to have been equivalent to a Category 1 hurricane. [CLS] [SEP] The following day, Conson struck Quezon Province with winds of 100 km/h (65 mph) before weakening. [CLS] [SEP] After crossing the archipelago, the storm entered the South China Sea where it was able to re-strengthen. [CLS] [SEP] By July 16, Conson attained typhoon status as it neared the southern Chinese island of Hainan. [CLS] [SEP] After brushing the island at peak intensity with sustained winds estimated at 130 km/h (80 mph), the storm weakened in the Gulf of Tonkin due to less favorable conditions. [CLS] [SEP] The storm eventually made landfall near Ha Noi, Vietnam on July 17 and dissipated the following day. [CLS] [SEP] In the Philippines, Conson produced widespread, torrential rains which triggered significant flooding. [CLS] [SEP] At least 76 people are known to have been killed across the country and 72 others are listed as missing. [CLS] [SEP] Preliminary damage estimates were placed at PHP189 million (US$4.1 million). [CLS] [SEP] In China, at least two people have been killed due to wind-related incidents. [CLS] [SEP] Hainan Province sustained significant damage from the typhoon, with damage estimated at Â¥500 million (US$73.8 million). [CLS] [SEP] Widespread damage was reported in Vietnam where at least two people were killed and 17 others were listed as missing. [CLS] [SEP]
