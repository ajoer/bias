The 1965 Skyways Coach-Air Avro 748 crash occurred on 11 July 1965 when Avro 748-101 Series 1 G-ARMV, flown during a scheduled international passenger flight from Beauvais Airport, Oise, France, crashed on landing at its intended destination of Lympne Airport, Kent, United Kingdom. [CLS] [SEP] The accident was due to the grass runway being unable to support the weight of the aircraft during a heavy landing. [CLS] [SEP] This caused the nose wheels to dig in and the aircraft to overturn, losing both wings and the starboard tailplane in the process. [CLS] [SEP] All 52 people on board survived. [CLS] [SEP] This was the first accident involving the Avro 748/HS 748 that resulted in a write-off. [CLS] [SEP] A concrete runway was later installed at Lympne. [CLS] [SEP]
