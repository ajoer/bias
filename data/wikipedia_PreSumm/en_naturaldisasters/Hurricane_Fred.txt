[CLS] Hurricane Fred was the easternmost Atlantic hurricane to form in the tropics, and the first to move through Cape Verde since 1892. [SEP] [CLS] The second hurricane and sixth named storm of the 2015 Atlantic hurricane season, Fred originated from a well-defined tropical wave over West Africa in late August 2015. [SEP] [CLS] Once offshore, the wave moved northwestward within a favorable tropospheric environment and strengthened into a tropical storm on August 30. [SEP] [CLS] The following day, Fred grew to a Category 1 hurricane with peak winds of 85 mph (140 km/h) as it approached Cape Verde. [SEP] [CLS] After passing Boa Vista and moving away from Santo Antão, it entered a phase of steady weakening, dropping below hurricane status by September 1. [SEP] [CLS] Fred then turned to the west-northwest, enduring increasingly hostile wind shear, but maintained its status as a tropical cyclone despite repeated forecasts of imminent dissipation. [SEP] [CLS] It fluctuated between minimal tropical storm and tropical depression strength through September 4–5 before curving sharply to the north. [SEP] [CLS] By September 6, Fred's circulation pattern had diminished considerably, and the storm dissipated later that day. [SEP] [CLS] Under threat from the hurricane, all of Cape Verde was placed under a hurricane warning for the first time in the nation's history. [SEP] [CLS] Gale-force winds battered much of the Barlavento region throughout August 31, downing trees and utility poles. [SEP] [CLS] On the easternmost islands of Boa Vista and Sal, Fred leveled roofs and left villages without power or phone services for a few days. [SEP] [CLS] About 70 percent of the houses in Povoação Velha suffered light to moderate damage. [SEP] [CLS] Across the northernmost islands, rainstorms flooded homes, washed out roads, and ruined farmland; São Nicolau endured great losses of crops and livestock. [SEP] [CLS] Material damage across Cape Verde totaled US$2.5 million, though the rain's overall impact on agriculture was positive and replenishing. [SEP] [CLS] Swells from the hurricane produced violent seas along the West African shoreline, destroying fishing villages and submerging swaths of residential areas in Senegal. [SEP] [CLS] Between the coasts of West Africa and Cape Verde, maritime incidents related to Fred resulted in nine deaths. [SEP] [CLS]
