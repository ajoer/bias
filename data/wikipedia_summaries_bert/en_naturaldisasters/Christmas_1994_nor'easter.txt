The Christmas 1994 nor'easter was an intense cyclone along the East Coast of the United States and Atlantic Canada. [CLS] [SEP] It developed from an area of low pressure in the southeast Gulf of Mexico near the Florida Keys, and moved across the state of Florida. [CLS] [SEP] As it entered the warm waters of the Gulf Stream in the Atlantic Ocean, it began to rapidly intensify, exhibiting traits of a tropical system, including the formation of an eye. [CLS] [SEP] It attained a pressure of 970 millibars on December 23 and 24, and after moving northward, it came ashore near New York City on Christmas Eve. [CLS] [SEP] Because of the uncertain nature of the storm, the National Hurricane Center (NHC) did not classify it as a tropical cyclone. [CLS] [SEP] Heavy rain from the developing storm contributed to significant flooding in South Carolina. [CLS] [SEP] Much of the rest of the East Coast was affected by high winds, coastal flooding, and beach erosion. [CLS] [SEP] New York State and New England bore the brunt of the storm; damage was extensive on Long Island, and in Connecticut, 130,000 households lost electric power during the storm. [CLS] [SEP] Widespread damage and power outages also occurred throughout Rhode Island and Massachusetts, where the storm generated 30-foot (9.1 m) waves along the coast. [CLS] [SEP] Because of the warm weather pattern that contributed to the storm's development, precipitation was limited to rain. [CLS] [SEP] Two people were killed, and damage amounted to at least $21 million. [CLS] [SEP]
