[CLS] The Great Labor Day Hurricane of 1935 (formally known as Hurricane Three) was the most intense Atlantic hurricane to make landfall on record in terms of pressure, and tied with Hurricane Dorian in 2019 for the strongest landfalling Atlantic hurricane by maximum sustained winds, with winds of 185 mph (295 km/h). [SEP] [CLS] It was also the most intense Atlantic hurricane on record until Hurricane Gilbert in 1988. [SEP] [CLS] The fourth tropical cyclone, third tropical storm, second hurricane, and second major hurricane of the 1935 Atlantic hurricane season, the Labor Day hurricane was one of four Category 5 hurricanes on record to strike the contiguous United States, along with Hurricane Andrew in 1992, Hurricane Camille in 1969, and Hurricane Michael in 2018. [SEP] [CLS] In addition, it was the third most intense Atlantic hurricane on record in terms of barometric pressure, behind Hurricane Gilbert in 1988 and Hurricane Wilma in 2005. [SEP] [CLS] The hurricane intensified rapidly, passing near Long Key on the evening of Monday, September 2. [SEP] [CLS] The region was swept by a massive storm surge as the eye passed over the area. [SEP] [CLS] The waters quickly receded after carving new channels connecting the bay with the ocean; however, gale-force winds and high seas persisted into Tuesday, preventing rescue efforts. [SEP] [CLS] The storm continued northwestward along the Florida west coast, weakening before its second landfall near Cedar Key, Florida, on September 4. [SEP] [CLS] The compact and intense hurricane caused catastrophic damage in the upper Florida Keys, as a storm surge of approximately 18 to 20 feet (5.5 to 6.1 m) swept over the low-lying islands. [SEP] [CLS] The hurricane's strong winds and the surge destroyed nearly all the structures between Tavernier and Marathon. [SEP] [CLS] The town of Islamorada was obliterated. [SEP] [CLS] Portions of the Key West Extension of the Florida East Coast Railway were severely damaged or destroyed. [SEP] [CLS] In addition, many veterans died in work camps created for the construction of the Overseas Highway, in part due to poor working conditions. [SEP] [CLS] The hurricane also caused additional damage in northwest Florida, Georgia, and the Carolinas. [SEP] [CLS]
