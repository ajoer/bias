[CLS] Very Intense Tropical Cyclone Hary was the strongest tropical cyclone in the 2001–02 South-West Indian Ocean cyclone season and the strongest storm worldwide in 2002. [SEP] [CLS] Developing on March 5 from the monsoon trough, the storm initially moved generally to the west and gradually intensified. [SEP] [CLS] With favorable conditions, Hary quickly intensified on March 7, developing an eye and well-defined outflow. [SEP] [CLS] After reaching an initial peak, the cyclone briefly weakened due to an eyewall replacement cycle, by which time the storm turned southwestward toward Madagascar. [SEP] [CLS] Hary re-intensified and attained peak winds of 220 km/h (140 mph) on March 10 just offshore eastern Madagascar, which made it the first very intense tropical cyclone since 2000. [SEP] [CLS] After peaking, Hary weakened due to land interaction, and it struck Madagascar southeast of Antalaha. [SEP] [CLS] It was turning south over land, and as a result it quickly moved offshore. [SEP] [CLS] There were three deaths in the country, one of which from electrocution. [SEP] [CLS] There was locally heavy crop damage, and four bridges were destroyed. [SEP] [CLS] However, the damage was considered minimal, given the intensity of the storm. [SEP] [CLS] After affecting Madagascar, Hary accelerated to the southeast, and the eastern periphery of the circulation moved over Réunion. [SEP] [CLS] On the mountain peaks of the island, rainfall reached 1,344 mm (52.9 in), although it was much less near the coast. [SEP] [CLS] The rainfall caused flooding, killing one person, and 20,000 people were left without power. [SEP] [CLS] Hary became extratropical on March 13, although its remnants continued for several days as a powerful mid-latitude storm. [SEP] [CLS]
