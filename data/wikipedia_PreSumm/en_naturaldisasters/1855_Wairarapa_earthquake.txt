[CLS] The 1855 Wairarapa earthquake occurred on 23 January at about 9 p.m., affecting much of the Cook Strait area of New Zealand, including Marlborough in the South Island and Wellington and Wairarapa in the North Island. [SEP] [CLS] In Wellington, close to the epicenter, shaking lasted for at least 50 seconds. [SEP] [CLS] The moment magnitude is estimated to have been in the range 8.2â€“8.3, the most powerful recorded in New Zealand since systematic European colonisation began in 1840. [SEP] [CLS] This earthquake was associated with the largest observed movement on a strike-slip fault, maximum 18 metres (59 ft). [SEP] [CLS] It has been suggested that the surface rupture formed by this event helped influence Charles Lyell to link earthquakes with rapid movement on faults. [SEP] [CLS]
