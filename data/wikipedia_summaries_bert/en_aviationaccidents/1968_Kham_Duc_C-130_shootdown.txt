The 1968 Kham Duc C-130 shootdown was the aircraft shootdown of a United States Air Force Lockheed C-130B Hercules aircraft during the Battle of Kham Duc on May 12, 1968. [CLS] [SEP] All 155 people on board were killed. [CLS] [SEP] At the time, it was the deadliest aircraft crash in history, to date is the deadliest aviation accident/incident on Vietnamese soil, and remained the deadliest accident involving a U.S. [CLS] [SEP] military aircraft until Arrow Air Flight 1285 in 1985. [CLS] [SEP] The aircraft, commanded by Major Bernard L. [CLS] [SEP] Bucher, was participating in the evacuation of South Vietnamese civilians from the Kham Duc campsite. [CLS] [SEP] The C-130 approached the Kham Duc airstrip from the south and managed to land despite taking hits from opposing North Vietnamese forces. [CLS] [SEP] As soon as it landed, approximately 149 South Vietnamese rushed onto the aircraft. [CLS] [SEP] Once the aircraft was full, Major Bucher proceeded to take off in a northward direction, unaware that the North Vietnamese were concentrated in that area. [CLS] [SEP] According to eyewitness reports, the aircraft, under intense enemy mortar and small-arms fire, shook violently out of control, crashed into a nearby ravine less than a mile (1.6 km) from the end of the airstrip, and burned, killing all of the evacuees and the aircraft's crew of six.
