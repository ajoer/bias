[CLS] The Night of the Big Wind (Irish: Oíche na Gaoithe Móire) was a powerful European windstorm that swept across Ireland and the United Kingdom beginning on the afternoon of 6 January 1839, causing severe damage to property and several hundred deaths; 20% to 25% of houses in north Dublin were damaged or destroyed, and 42 ships were wrecked. [SEP] [CLS] The storm attained a very low barometric pressure of 918 hectopascals (27.1 inHg) and tracked eastwards to the north of Ireland, with gusts of over 100 knots (185 km/h; 115 mph), before moving across the north of England to continental Europe, where it eventually dissipated. [SEP] [CLS] At the time, it was the worst storm to hit Ireland for 300 years. [SEP] [CLS] Liverpool also suffered severely, with many shipwrecks and structural damage resulting from strong winds. [SEP] [CLS] 120 people died as a result of such accidents in the city alone. [SEP] [CLS] Two major shipwrecks resulted in damage worth at least £500,000, equivalent to £52.2 million in 2020.
