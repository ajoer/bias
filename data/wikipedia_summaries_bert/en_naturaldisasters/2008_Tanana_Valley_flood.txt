[CLS] The 2008 Tanana Valley flood or the 2008 Fairbanks flood was a flood in late July and early August 2008 that affected several rivers in the central portion of the American state of Alaska. [SEP] [CLS] The city of Fairbanks, Alaska saw high water levels, while the towns of Nenana, Salcha, and Old Minto received heavy damage. [SEP] [CLS] The Salcha River and Tanana River reached their second-highest levels since record-keeping began (the highest was during the 1967 Tanana Valley Flood), while the Chena River, which bisects Fairbanks, was kept below flood stage by the use of the Chena River Lakes Flood Control Project. [SEP] [CLS] Several hundred homes were inundated by the flood in Fairbanks, Salcha, unincorporated Fairbanks North Star Borough, Nenana, and smaller villages, but due to early warnings from the National Weather Service, volunteer fire departments, and the borough's emergency contact system, no one was injured. [SEP] [CLS] The area affected by the flood was declared a state disaster area, making residents whose homes were flooded eligible for state aid. [SEP] [CLS] The long-term effects of the flood, including its effect on the salmon spawning season, are as yet unknown. [SEP] [CLS]
