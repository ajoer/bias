[CLS] The 1987 Gulf Coast tropical storm caused flooding along the Gulf Coast of the United States. [SEP] [CLS] The second tropical cyclone and first tropical storm of the 1987 Atlantic hurricane season, it originated from a tropical wave in the Gulf of Mexico, southeast of Texas, on August 9. [SEP] [CLS] Initially a tropical depression, the cyclone moved north-northwestward and slightly intensified into a tropical storm later that day. [SEP] [CLS] By August 10, it made landfall between Galveston and Beaumont. [SEP] [CLS] The system weakened after moving inland and turned towards the east and later southeast. [SEP] [CLS] Briefly reemerging over the Gulf on August 15, the depression moved onshore a second time in Florida, before dissipating over eastern Georgia on August 17. [SEP] [CLS] Due to the relatively weak nature of the system, it caused relatively little damage. [SEP] [CLS] However, the system dropped heavy rainfall, peaking at 21.05 inches (535 mm) in southern Mississippi. [SEP] [CLS] This resulted in flooding, which forced more than 400 people to evacuate their homes, some of which had 2 to 4 feet (0.61 to 1.22 m) of water. [SEP] [CLS] Flash flooding was reported in a few others states, including Alabama, Florida, and Louisiana. [SEP] [CLS] In all, losses from the unnamed storm reached $7.4 million (1987 USD) and one person was reported missing after being thrown overboard a boat in rough seas. [SEP] [CLS]
