Hurricane Iris was a small, but powerful tropical cyclone that caused widespread destruction in Belize. [CLS] [SEP] Iris was the second-strongest storm of the 2001 Atlantic hurricane season, behind Hurricane Michelle. [CLS] [SEP] It was the ninth named storm, fifth hurricane, and third major hurricane of the year, forming from a tropical wave on October 4 just southeast of Barbados. [CLS] [SEP] It moved westward through the Caribbean, intensifying into a tropical storm on October 5 south of Puerto Rico, and into a hurricane on the following day. [CLS] [SEP] While passing south of the Dominican Republic, Iris dropped heavy rainfall that caused landslides, killing eight people. [CLS] [SEP] Later, the hurricane passed south of Jamaica, where it destroyed two houses. [CLS] [SEP] On reaching the western Caribbean Sea, Iris rapidly intensified into a Category 4 on the Saffir–Simpson scale. [CLS] [SEP] A small hurricane with an eye of only 7 mi (11 km) in diameter, Iris reached peak winds of 145 mph (230 km/h) before making landfall in southern Belize near Monkey River Town on October 9. [CLS] [SEP] The hurricane quickly dissipated over Central America, although its remnants contributed to the formation of Tropical Storm Manuel in the eastern Pacific Ocean. [CLS] [SEP] The hurricane caused severe damage—destroying homes, flooding streets, and leveling trees—in coastal towns south of Belize City. [CLS] [SEP] Destruction was heaviest in Belize and totaled $250 million (2001 USD). [CLS] [SEP] Because Iris was compact, the damage was largely confined to 72% of the houses in the Toledo district and 50% of the houses in the Stann Creek district. [CLS] [SEP] The hurricane damaged or destroyed 3,718 homes nationwide, and wrecked more than 95% of the homes in 35 villages in the poorest parts of the country. [CLS] [SEP] Iris left about 15,000 people homeless, many receiving assistance from the government and the local Red Cross chapter. [CLS] [SEP] High winds also damaged large swaths of forest and crops, mostly affecting the banana industry. [CLS] [SEP] Iris killed 24 people in Belize, including 20 who died when a scuba diving boat capsized near Big Creek. [CLS] [SEP] The storm also killed eight people and damaged about 2,500 homes in neighboring Guatemala, and later dropped heavy rainfall in southern Mexico, where two people died. [CLS] [SEP]
