[CLS] Rajiv Ratna Gandhi ( (listen); 20 August 1944 – 21 May 1991) was an Indian politician who served as the 6th Prime Minister of India from 1984 to 1989.

[SEP] [CLS] Gandhi was from the politically powerful Nehru–Gandhi family, which had been associated with the Indian National Congress party. [SEP] [CLS] For much of his childhood, his maternal grandfather Jawaharlal Nehru was Prime Minister. [SEP] [CLS] Gandhi attended college in the United Kingdom. [SEP] [CLS] He returned to India in 1966 and became a professional pilot for the state-owned Indian Airlines. [SEP] [CLS] In 1968, he married Sonia Gandhi; the couple settled in Delhi to a domestic life with their children Rahul Gandhi and Priyanka Gandhi Vadra. [SEP] [CLS] For much of the 1970s, his mother Indira Gandhi was prime minister and his brother Sanjay Gandhi an MP; despite this, Rajiv Gandhi remained apolitical. [SEP] [CLS] After Sanjay's death in a plane crash in 1980, Gandhi reluctantly entered politics at the behest of Indira. [SEP] [CLS] The following year he won his brother's Parliamentary seat of Amethi and became a member of the Lok Sabha—the lower house of India's Parliament. [SEP] [CLS] As part of his political grooming, Rajiv was made general secretary of the Congress party and given significant responsibility in organising the 1982 Asian Games. [SEP] [CLS] On the morning of 31 October 1984, his mother was assassinated by one of her bodyguards; later that day, Gandhi was appointed Prime Minister.

[SEP] [CLS] That December, Congress party won the largest Lok Sabha majority to date, 411 seats out of 542. [SEP] [CLS] Rajiv Gandhi's period in office was mired in controversies; perhaps the greatest crises were the Bhopal disaster, Bofors scandal and Mohd. [SEP] [CLS] Ahmed Khan v.
