Typhoon Gay, known in the Philippines as Typhoon Seniang, was the strongest and longest-lasting storm of the 1992 Pacific typhoon season. [CLS] [SEP] It formed on November 14 near the International Date Line from a monsoon trough, which also spawned two other systems. [CLS] [SEP] Typhoon Gay later moved through the Marshall Islands as an intensifying typhoon, and after passing through the country it reached its peak intensity over open waters. [CLS] [SEP] The Joint Typhoon Warning Center (JTWC) estimated peak winds of 295 km/h (185 mph) and a minimum barometric pressure of 872 mb (25.8 inHg). [CLS] [SEP] However, the Japan Meteorological Agency (JMA), which is the official warning center in the western Pacific, estimated winds of 205 km/h (125 mph), with a pressure of 900 mbar (27 inHg). [CLS] [SEP] Gay weakened rapidly after peaking because of interaction with another typhoon, and it struck Guam with winds of 160 km/h (100 mph) on November 23. [CLS] [SEP] The typhoon briefly re-intensified before weakening and becoming extratropical south of Japan on November 30. [CLS] [SEP] The typhoon first affected the Marshall Islands, where 5,000 people became homeless and heavy crop damage was reported. [CLS] [SEP] The nation's capital of Majuro experienced power and water outages during the storm. [CLS] [SEP] There were no fatalities among Marshall Islands citizens, although the typhoon killed a sailor traveling around the world. [CLS] [SEP] When Gay struck Guam, it became the sixth typhoon of the year to affect the island. [CLS] [SEP] Most of the weaker structures had been destroyed during Typhoon Omar earlier in the year, resulting in little additional damage from Gay. [CLS] [SEP] Because of its substantial weakening, the typhoon had a disrupted inner-core and produced minimal rainfall. [CLS] [SEP] However, strong winds scorched the plants on Guam with saltwater, causing extensive defoliation. [CLS] [SEP] Further north, high waves from the typhoon destroyed a house on Saipan, and heavy rainfall in Okinawa, Japan, caused flooding and power outages. [CLS] [SEP]
