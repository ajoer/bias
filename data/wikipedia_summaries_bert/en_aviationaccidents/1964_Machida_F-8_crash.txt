[SEP] [CLS] The other aircraft landed safely at Atsugi. [SEP] [CLS] The crash killed four people and injured 32 others on the ground. [SEP] [CLS] The stricken aircraft's pilot, Captain R. [SEP] [CLS] L. [SEP] [CLS] Bown of Seattle, Washington, successfully ejected at 5,000 feet and landed on a car, suffering minor bruises. [SEP] [CLS] The accident destroyed seven houses.
