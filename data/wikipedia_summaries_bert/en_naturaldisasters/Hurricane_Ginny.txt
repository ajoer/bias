Hurricane Ginny was the strongest recorded tropical cyclone to make landfall in Canada, as well as the latest hurricane on a calendar year to affect the U.S. [CLS] [SEP] state of Maine. [CLS] [SEP] The eighth tropical storm of the 1963 Atlantic hurricane season, Ginny developed on October 16 over the Bahamas, although it was not initially a fully tropical cyclone. [CLS] [SEP] As it moved to the North and later northwest, Ginny intensified to hurricane status as it became more tropical. [CLS] [SEP] For eight days, it was located within 250 mi (400 km) of the United States coastline. [CLS] [SEP] After approaching North Carolina, Ginny looped to the southwest and approached within 50 mi (80 km) of the Florida coastline. [CLS] [SEP] It turned to the North, to the East, and later to the northeast, strengthening late in its duration to peak winds of 110 mph (175 km/h). [CLS] [SEP] Ginny became an extratropical cyclone shortly after striking Nova Scotia at its peak intensity on October 29. [CLS] [SEP] Although it remained close to the United States coastline, its impact was minor. [CLS] [SEP] Beach erosion and light rainfall was reported along much of the coastline, although the precipitation was beneficial in ending droughts in South Carolina and New England. [CLS] [SEP] High waves destroyed one house in North Carolina. [CLS] [SEP] Damage was heaviest in New England, where several buildings were damaged and thousands were left without power. [CLS] [SEP] The passage of Ginny resulted in a snow storm across eastern New England, particularly in northern Maine, where it killed two people. [CLS] [SEP] In Atlantic Canada, the extratropical storm produced high wind and waves, causing damage to boats and resulting in power outages. [CLS] [SEP]
