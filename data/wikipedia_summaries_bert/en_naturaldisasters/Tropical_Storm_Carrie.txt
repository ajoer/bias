Tropical Storm Carrie was a strong tropical storm that affected the East Coast of the United States in early September 1972. [CLS] [SEP] The third tropical cyclone of the 1972 Atlantic hurricane season, Carrie formed on August 29 from a complex sequence of meteorological events starting with the emergence of a tropical wave into the Atlantic in the middle of August. [CLS] [SEP] Tracking generally northward throughout its life, Carrie reached an initial peak intensity as a moderate tropical storm before nearly weakening back into tropical depression status. [CLS] [SEP] The storm began to reintensify in a baroclinic environment after turning toward the northwest; its winds of 70 miles per hour (110 km/h) as it was transitioning into an extratropical system eclipsed the cyclone's previous maximum strength. [CLS] [SEP] The extratropical remnants of Carrie skirted eastern New England before making landfall in Maine on September 4 and dissipating over the Gulf of Saint Lawrence during the next two days. [CLS] [SEP] Carrie had a minimal impact on the East Coast south of New England, limited to increased swells, gusty winds, and light rainfall. [CLS] [SEP] The worst conditions occurred over southeastern New England, where wind gusts reached 84 mph (135 km/h) and rainfall exceeded 1 ft (0.30 m). [CLS] [SEP] Damage was most severe along and slightly inland from the coast. [CLS] [SEP] Thousands of people became stranded on offshore islands of Massachusetts after dangerous conditions created by the storm prompted the suspension of steamship service. [CLS] [SEP] Overall damage was generally light, with total monetary losses valued at $1,780,000, and four deaths are blamed on the storm. [CLS] [SEP]
