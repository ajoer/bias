Hurricane Eloise was the most destructive tropical cyclone of the 1975 Atlantic hurricane season. [CLS] [SEP] The fifth tropical storm, fourth hurricane, and second major hurricane of the season, Eloise formed as a tropical depression on September 13 to the east of the Virgin Islands. [CLS] [SEP] The depression tracked westward and intensified into a tropical storm while passing to the north of Puerto Rico. [CLS] [SEP] Eloise briefly attained hurricane intensity soon thereafter, but weakened back to a tropical storm upon making landfall over Hispaniola. [CLS] [SEP] A weak and disorganized cyclone, Eloise emerged into open waters of the northern Caribbean Sea; upon striking the northern Yucatan Peninsula, it turned north and began to re-intensify. [CLS] [SEP] In the Gulf of Mexico, the cyclone quickly matured and became a Category 3 hurricane on September 23. [CLS] [SEP] Eloise made landfall along the Florida Panhandle west of Panama City before moving inland across Alabama and dissipating on September 24. [CLS] [SEP] The storm produced torrential rainfall throughout the islands of Puerto Rico and Hispaniola, causing extensive flooding that led to severe damage and more than 40 deaths. [CLS] [SEP] Thousands of people in these areas became homeless as flood waters submerged numerous communities. [CLS] [SEP] As Eloise progressed westward, it affected Cuba to a lesser extent. [CLS] [SEP] In advance of the storm, about 100,000 residents evacuated from the Gulf Coast region. [CLS] [SEP] Upon making landfall in Florida, Eloise generated wind gusts of 155 miles per hour (249 km/h), which demolished hundreds of buildings in the area. [CLS] [SEP] The storm's severe winds, waves, and storm surge left numerous beaches, piers, and other coastal structures heavily impaired. [CLS] [SEP] Wind-related damage extended into inland Alabama and Georgia. [CLS] [SEP] Further north, torrential rains along the entire East Coast of the United States created an unprecedented and far-reaching flooding event, especially into the Mid-Atlantic States. [CLS] [SEP] In that region, an additional 17 people died as a result of freshwater flooding from the post-tropical storm; infrastructural and geological effects were comparable to those from Hurricane Agnes several years prior. [CLS] [SEP] Across the United States, damage amounted to approximately $560 million. [CLS] [SEP] The storm killed 80 people along its entire track; due to the severe damage, the name "Eloise" was retired from the Atlantic tropical cyclone naming lists. [CLS] [SEP]
