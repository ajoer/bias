[CLS] On April 4, 1955, a United Airlines Douglas DC-6 named Mainliner Idaho crashed shortly after taking off from Long Island MacArthur Airport, in Ronkonkoma, Islip, New York, United States. [SEP] [CLS] The flight was operated for the purpose of maintaining the currency of the instrument rating of two of the airline's pilots. [SEP] [CLS] Shortly after takeoff and only seconds after climbing through 150 feet (46 m), the plane began banking to the right. [SEP] [CLS] It continued to roll through 90 degrees; the nose then dropped suddenly and moments later it struck the ground. [SEP] [CLS] All three members of the flight crew were killed upon impact. [SEP] [CLS] A subsequent investigation found a simulated engine failure procedure was being conducted, which involved a member of the crew pulling back the throttle lever for engine No. [SEP] [CLS] 4 prior to taking off. [SEP] [CLS] Investigators found that if the throttle lever was pulled back too far, it would cause the propeller to reverseâ€”a feature designed to slow the aircraft upon landing. [SEP] [CLS] Once the landing gear was raised, the crew would have to raise a metal flag in the cockpit to bring the propeller blades back into the correct position, since a safety device prevented electric power from operating the rotating mechanism at the roots of the blades unless the aircraft was on the ground or the flag was manually raised. [SEP] [CLS] The Civil Aeronautics Board (CAB) concluded one of the flight crew applied full power to No. [SEP] [CLS] 4 engine, thinking this would bring the aircraft out of the increasing bank. [SEP] [CLS] Because the blades were reversed and the flag was not raised, that increased the reverse thrust from No. [SEP] [CLS] 4 engine, causing the DC-6 to spiral out of control. [SEP] [CLS] Since the plane was so close to the ground, the suddenness of the bank and dive meant the flight crew had no chance to recover the aircraft before impact. [SEP] [CLS] In the aftermath of the accident, the Civil Aeronautics Administration (CAA) issued an Airworthiness Directive ordering all DC-6 and DC-6B aircraft to be fitted with a manual device which could prevent the inadvertent reversal of the propeller blades. [SEP] [CLS] United Airlines also stated they had begun installing reverse thrust indicator lights in the cockpits of their DC-6 aircraft, which would warn pilots when a propeller had reversed.
