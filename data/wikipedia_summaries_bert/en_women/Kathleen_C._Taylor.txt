[CLS] [SEP] She currently works at Columbia University and consults for the United States Department of Energy.Taylor attended Douglass College at Rutgers University, earning a bachelor's in chemistry in 1964; she completed her Ph.D. [CLS] [SEP] in physical chemistry in 1968 at Northwestern University. [CLS] [SEP] She did postdoctoral research at the University of Edinburgh and then joined General Motors in 1970. [CLS] [SEP] Her work at GM on catalytic converters helped reduce pollution from car exhaust, following work done earlier by Eugene Houdry.
