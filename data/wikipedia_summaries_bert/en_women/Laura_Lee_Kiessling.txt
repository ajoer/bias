Dr. [CLS] [SEP] Laura Lee Kiessling (born 21 September 1960) is an American chemist and the Novartis Professor of Chemistry at the Massachusetts Institute of Technology. [CLS] [SEP] Kiessling's research focuses on elucidating and exploiting interactions on the cell surface, especially those mediated by proteins binding to carbohydrates. [CLS] [SEP] Multivalent protein-carbohydrate interactions play roles in cell-cell recognition and signal transduction. [CLS] [SEP] Understanding and manipulating these interactions provides tools to study biological processes and design therapeutic treatments. [CLS] [SEP] Kiessling's interdisciplinary research combines organic synthesis, polymer chemistry, structural biology, and molecular and cell biology. [CLS] [SEP]
