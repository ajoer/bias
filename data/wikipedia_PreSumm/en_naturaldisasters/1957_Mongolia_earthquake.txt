[CLS] The 1957 Mongolia earthquake occurred on December 4. [SEP] [CLS] The earthquake resulted in thirty deaths, and the destruction of all houses in Dzun Bogd and Bayan Gobi. [SEP] [CLS] Subsidence, faulting and fissures occurred in the Bahar Uula and Ih Bogd Uul Mountains. [SEP] [CLS] The largest fissure was 250 km (160 mi) long with as much as 9–11 m (30–36 ft) of vertical and 3 m (9.8 ft) of horizontal offset. [SEP] [CLS] Because of the extremely sparse population in the area, this is perhaps the least damaging great earthquake to have occurred on land in the 20th century. [SEP] [CLS]
