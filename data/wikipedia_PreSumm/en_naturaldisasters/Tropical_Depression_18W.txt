[CLS] The 2010 Pacific typhoon season was the least active Pacific typhoon season on record, featuring only 14 named storms; seven of them strengthened into typhoons while one reached super typhoon intensity. [SEP] [CLS] The Pacific typhoon season during 2010 was in fact less active than the 2010 Atlantic hurricane season, the only such occurrence other than 2005. [SEP] [CLS] In the same year, the Pacific hurricane season broke the same record being the least active season on record. [SEP] [CLS] During the season, no storms made landfall in mainland Japan, the only second such occurrence since 1988. [SEP] [CLS] Also, all of the 14 named storms developed west of 150°E. [SEP] [CLS] The season ran throughout 2010, though most tropical cyclones tend to develop between May and October. [SEP] [CLS] The season's first named storm, Omais, developed on March 24 while the season's last named storm, Chaba dissipated or became extratropical on October 30. [SEP] [CLS] During the season only three storms were notable. [SEP] [CLS] Typhoon Kompasu was the strongest storm to make landfall over in South Korea in 15 years. [SEP] [CLS] In September, Typhoon Fanapi struck Taiwan and China, causing heavy damage in the two countries. [SEP] [CLS] During October, Typhoon Megi reached its peak intensity with a minimum barometric pressure of 885 hPa, making it one of the most intense typhoons ever recorded. [SEP] [CLS] In addition, a rare subtropical storm had developed during December and intensified into Tropical Storm Omeka where it crossed the basin. [SEP] [CLS] The scope of this article is limited to the Pacific Ocean to the north of the equator between 100°E and 180th meridian. [SEP] [CLS] Within the northwestern Pacific Ocean, there are two separate agencies that assign names to tropical cyclones which can often result in a cyclone having two names. [SEP] [CLS] The Japan Meteorological Agency (JMA) will name a tropical cyclone should it be judged to have 10-minute sustained wind speeds of at least 65 km/h (40 mph) anywhere in the basin, whilst the Philippine Atmospheric, Geophysical and Astronomical Services Administration (PAGASA) assigns names to tropical cyclones which move into or form as a tropical depression in their area of responsibility located between 135°E and 115°E and between 5°N–25°N regardless of whether or not a tropical cyclone has already been given a name by the JMA. [SEP] [CLS] Tropical depressions that are monitored by the United States' Joint Typhoon Warning Center (JTWC) are given a number with a "W" suffix. [SEP] [CLS]
