Hurricane Fran caused extensive damage in the United States in early September 1996. [CLS] [SEP] The sixth named storm, fifth hurricane, and fourth major hurricane of the 1996 Atlantic hurricane season, Fran developed from a tropical wave near Cape Verde on August 23. [CLS] [SEP] Due to nearby Hurricane Edouard, the depression remained disorganized as it tracked westward, though it eventually intensified into Tropical Storm Fran on August 27. [CLS] [SEP] While heading west-northwestward, Fran steadily strengthened into a hurricane on August 29, but weakened back to a tropical storm on the following day. [CLS] [SEP] On August 31, Fran quickly re-intensified into a hurricane. [CLS] [SEP] By September 2, Fran began to parallel the islands of the Bahamas and slowly curved north-northwestward. [CLS] [SEP] Fran peaked as a 120 mph (195 km/h) Category 3 hurricane by early on September 5. [CLS] [SEP] Thereafter, Fran weakened slightly, before it made landfall near Cape Fear, North Carolina early on September 6. [CLS] [SEP] The storm rapidly weakened inland and was only a tropical depression later that day. [CLS] [SEP] Eventually, Fran curved east-northeastward and transitioned into an extratropical cyclone over Ontario early on September 9. [CLS] [SEP] In Florida, high tides capsized a boat with five people aboard, though all were rescued. [CLS] [SEP] No significant effects were reported in Georgia. [CLS] [SEP] The outer bands of Fran produced high winds and light to moderate rainfall in South Carolina. [CLS] [SEP] As a result, numerous trees and powerlines were downed, which damaged cars, left over 63,000 people without electricity. [CLS] [SEP] Large waves in North Carolina caused significant coastal flooding in some cities. [CLS] [SEP] Overall, Fran was attributed to 27 fatalities and $5 billion (1996 USD) in damage. [CLS] [SEP] Fran is also the most recent hurricane to make landfall in the Carolinas as a major hurricane. [CLS] [SEP]
