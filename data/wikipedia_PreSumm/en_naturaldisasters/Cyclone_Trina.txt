[CLS] Tropical Cyclone Trina (Fiji Meteorological Service designation: 01F, Joint Typhoon Warning Center designation: 06P) was a weak but destructive tropical cyclone in late 2001 which caused some of the worst flooding in the South Pacific island of Mangaia, Cook Islands, in nearly 50 years. [SEP] [CLS] Forming out of an upper-level low pressure system on November 29 near the island of Rarotonga, or roughly 1,470 mi (2,365 km) southeast of Fiji, Trina remained practically stationary as it meandered in the same general area for over a week. [SEP] [CLS] Due to unfavorable conditions for tropical cyclogenesis, the storm struggled to develop significant convection, preventing it from intensifying beyond 65 km/h (40 mph). [SEP] [CLS] After finally succumbing to wind shear on December 2, the system weakened to a tropical depression near Mangaia and dissipated several days later. [SEP] [CLS] As a result of the cyclone's slow movement, heavy rains impacted the same area for more than a week, resulting in severe flooding. [SEP] [CLS] Throughout Mangaia, nearly 90% of the islands' staple crop was lost and about 60% of the livestock perished. [SEP] [CLS] Following an assessment of the damage, it was determined that US$52,000 was needed to repair losses. [SEP] [CLS] Due to the severity of damage caused by Trina, its name was retired in May 2002 and replaced with Tino. [SEP] [CLS]
