The Jiashi earthquakes were a series of earthquakes from 1997 to 2003, with several earthquakes larger than Ms 6 occurring between January and April, 1997. [CLS] [SEP] Two strong earthquakes with magnitudes Ms 6.4 and 6.3 occurred on January 21, 1997, at 09:47 and 09:48 local time, respectively, in Jiashi County of Xinjiang Autonomous Region, NW China. [CLS] [SEP] The earthquakes occurred on a major strike-slip fault beneath the Tarim Basin. [CLS] [SEP] The fault has no surface expression and prior to the earthquake was not known about. [CLS] [SEP] At least 12 people were killed and 40 injured in the earthquakes of January 21. [CLS] [SEP] Another earthquake on March 1, 1997, at 14:04 local time with magnitude Ms 6.0 killed another person. [CLS] [SEP] On April 6, 6, 11, 16, other four earthquakes with magnitudes Ms 6.3, 6.4, 6.6, 6.3 killed 8 people. [CLS] [SEP] Several predictions were made in this earthquake series. [CLS] [SEP] Some of the predictions were not fulfilled, while some preceded the predicted earthquake from 2.5 hours to 4 days. [CLS] [SEP] The April 11 earthquake occurred 30 minutes after a prediction was made. [CLS] [SEP]
