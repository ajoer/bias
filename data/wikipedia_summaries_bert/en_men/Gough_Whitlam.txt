[CLS] Edward Gough Whitlam (; 11 July 1916 – 21 October 2014) was the 21st Prime Minister of Australia, serving from 1972 to 1975. [SEP] [CLS] The Leader of the Labor Party from 1967 to 1977, Whitlam led his party to power for the first time in 23 years at the 1972 election. [SEP] [CLS] He won the 1974 election before being controversially dismissed by the Governor-General of Australia, Sir John Kerr, at the climax of the 1975 Australian constitutional crisis. [SEP] [CLS] Whitlam remains the only Australian prime minister to have been removed from office in this manner. [SEP] [CLS] Whitlam served as an air navigator in the Royal Australian Air Force for four years during World War II, and worked as a barrister following the war. [SEP] [CLS] He was first elected to Parliament in 1952, representing Werriwa in the House of Representatives. [SEP] [CLS] Whitlam became Deputy Leader of the Labor Party in 1960, and in 1967, after the retirement of Arthur Calwell, was elected Leader and became the Leader of the Opposition. [SEP] [CLS] After narrowly losing the 1969 election, Whitlam led Labor to victory at the 1972 election after 23 years of continuous Liberal-Country Coalition Government. [SEP] [CLS] The Whitlam Government implemented a large number of new programmes and policy changes, including the termination of military conscription, institution of universal health care and free university education, and the implementation of legal aid programmes. [SEP] [CLS] With the opposition-controlled Senate delaying passage of bills, Whitlam called a double dissolution election in 1974 in which he won a slightly reduced majority in the House of Representatives, and picked up three Senate seats. [SEP] [CLS] The Whitlam government then instituted the first and only joint sitting enabled under s. [SEP] [CLS] 57 of the Constitution as part of the double dissolution process. [SEP] [CLS] Despite the government's second election victory, the opposition, reacting to government scandals and a flagging economy suffering from the 1973 oil crisis and the 1973–75 recession, continued to obstruct the government's programme in the Senate. [SEP] [CLS] In late 1975, the Opposition Senators refused to allow a vote on the government's appropriation bills, returning them to the House of Representatives with a demand that the government go to an election, thus denying the government supply. [SEP] [CLS] Whitlam refused to back down, arguing that his government, which held a clear majority in the House of Representatives, was being held to ransom by the Senate. [SEP] [CLS] The crisis ended on 11 November, when Whitlam arrived at a pre-arranged meeting with the Governor-General, Sir John Kerr, at Government House to call a half-Senate election. [SEP] [CLS] Kerr dismissed him and commissioned the opposition leader, Malcolm Fraser, as caretaker prime minister. [SEP] [CLS] Labor lost the subsequent election by a landslide. [SEP] [CLS] Whitlam stepped down after losing again at the 1977 election, and retired from parliament in 1978. [SEP] [CLS] Upon the election of the Hawke Government in 1983, he was appointed as Ambassador to UNESCO, a position he filled with distinction, and was elected a member of the UNESCO Executive Board. [SEP] [CLS] He remained active into his nineties. [SEP] [CLS] The propriety and circumstances of his dismissal and the legacy of his government have been frequently debated in the decades after he left office. [SEP] [CLS]
