Very Very Severe Cyclonic Storm Thane was the strongest tropical cyclone of 2011 within the Bay of Bengal. [CLS] [SEP] Thane initially developed as a tropical disturbance within the monsoon trough to the west of Indonesia. [CLS] [SEP] Over the next couple of days the disturbance gradually developed further while moving towards the northwest, and was declared a Depression during December 25, before being declared Cyclonic Storm Thane during the next day. [CLS] [SEP] As it was named, Thane started to turn towards the west under the influence of a subtropical ridge of high pressure before its development slowed during December 27, as a strong outflow and marginally favourable sea surface temperatures fought with persistent vertical wind shear. [CLS] [SEP] After its development had slowed during December 27, Thane became a Very Severe Cyclonic Storm during December 28, before as it approached the Indian states of Tamil Nadu, it weakened slightly. [CLS] [SEP] Thane then made landfall early on December 30, on the north Tamil Nadu coast between Cuddalore and Puducherry and rapidly weakened into a depression. [CLS] [SEP]
