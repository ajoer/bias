The 1934 Central America hurricane (called the El Salvador hurricane by meteorologist Ivan Ray Tannehill) was a tropical cyclone that caused at least 506 fatalities in Central America in June 1934, making it one of the deadliest hurricanes in Atlantic history. [CLS] [SEP] Its peak strength in the Gulf of Mexico was equivalent to a Category 2 hurricane on the modern Saffir–Simpson scale. [CLS] [SEP] The storm's path was erratic, beginning in the Gulf of Honduras on June 4 shortly before making its first landfall on the British Honduras as a tropical storm. [CLS] [SEP] It then took a looping course through Guatemala before reemerging into the Gulf of Honduras on June 8. [CLS] [SEP] The storm struck the northeastern Yucatán Peninsula as a hurricane on June 9, crossing into the western Gulf of Mexico where its course made another loop. [CLS] [SEP] An accelerated northward course followed, leading to the hurricane's landfall along the Louisiana coast on June 16. [CLS] [SEP] It weakened over land and transitioned into an extratropical cyclone on June 18, accelerating northeast towards the Canadian Maritimes thereafter. [CLS] [SEP] The storm's slow track over Central America between June 5–8 led to copious rainfall and triggered deadly floods; El Salvador and Honduras suffered most among Central American countries. [CLS] [SEP] Rainfall totals exceeded 25 in (640 mm) in some areas. [CLS] [SEP] Fourteen rivers in El Salvador rose above their banks. [CLS] [SEP] Entire villages in El Salvador were destroyed by the floods, with damage extensive in the country's interior and along its Pacific coast. [CLS] [SEP] Communications with El Salvador were downed for 36 hours. [CLS] [SEP] Extensive damage to crops and infrastructure occurred in and around San Salvador, where at least 2,000 people may have perished; property damage totaled $2 million (1934 USD) in the city. [CLS] [SEP] The hurricane was especially deadly in Honduras, primarily west and north of Tegucigalpa. [CLS] [SEP] In Ocotepeque, torrential rainfall caused a landslide that formed a natural dam, allowing floodwater to accumulate behind it. [CLS] [SEP] The dam failed on June 7, and the resulting debris flow downstream destroyed most of Ocotepeque and killed an estimated 468 people. [CLS] [SEP] The Yucatán Peninsula's sparse population mitigated significant damage when the hurricane struck Quintana Roo on June 9, though crops were impacted between Progreso and Payo Obispo. [CLS] [SEP] Much of the shores of the Gulf of Mexico were affected by the hurricane due to its erratic path. [CLS] [SEP] High winds and coastal floods stemming from swells generated by the storm reached Tamaulipas and Brazos Island along the western extents of Gulf of Mexico, while a stationary front tapped into moisture from the storm to produce heavy rainfall across southern Georgia and Florida. [CLS] [SEP] The worst of hurricane's impacts associated with its landfall in Louisiana were caused by the storm's rainbands that raked across Louisiana and Mississippi ahead of the hurricane's center. [CLS] [SEP] Six people were killed in Louisiana and four were killed in Mississippi. [CLS] [SEP] Approximately 3,000–7,000 homes were damaged in Louisiana. [CLS] [SEP] The storm continued to produce high winds and flooding rainfall as it tracked northeast across the Mid-Atlantic states and into Canada, causing power outages and property damage.
