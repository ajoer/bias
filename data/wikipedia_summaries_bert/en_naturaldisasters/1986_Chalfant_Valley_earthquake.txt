The 1986 Chalfant Valley earthquake struck southern Mono County near Bishop and Chalfant, California at 07:42:28 Pacific Daylight Time on July 21. [CLS] [SEP] With a moment magnitude of 6.2 and a maximum Mercalli intensity of VI (Strong), the shock injured two people and caused property damage estimated at $2.7 million in the affected areas. [CLS] [SEP] There was a significant foreshock and aftershock sequence that included a few moderate events, and was the last in a series of three earthquakes that affected southern California and the northern Owens Valley in July 1986. [CLS] [SEP] Strong motion stations at the Long Valley Dam and an instrumented building in Bishop captured light to moderate readings from the event. [CLS] [SEP] The faulting reached the surface of the ground, but the maximum amount of measurable slip was limited to about 11 centimeters (4.3 in) of strike-slip motion along the White Mountain Fault Zone. [CLS] [SEP] Other destructive and surface-rupturing earthquakes, as well as large volume volcanic eruptions, have occurred in the area. [CLS] [SEP] Although the series of shocks occurred within the White Mountain seismic gap, the region continues to have potential for a very large earthquake. [CLS] [SEP]
