Cyclone Bella was a destructive tropical cyclone that passed near the Mauritius outer island of Rodrigues. [CLS] [SEP] The second named storm of the season, Bella originated in the middle of January 1991 from a surge in the monsoon trough to the southwest of Sumatra. [CLS] [SEP] For several days, the system remained weak as it moved generally west-southwestward. [CLS] [SEP] On January 25, it intensified to tropical storm status, but Bella took three more days to intensify to tropical cyclone status, with 10 minute maximum sustained winds of 120 kilometres per hour (75 miles per hour). [CLS] [SEP] The cyclone attained peak intensity on January 29, officially reaching winds of 155 km/h (100 mph). [CLS] [SEP] The Joint Typhoon Warning Center unofficially estimated winds of 240 km/h (150 mph), the highest the agency estimated for any storm in the Southern Hemisphere in the year. [CLS] [SEP] Bella later turned to the southeast and weakened, passing about 50 km (30 mi) west of Rodrigues on January 31. [CLS] [SEP] The storm turned to the south-southwest and back to the southeast again, becoming extratropical on February 4.
