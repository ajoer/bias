[CLS] [SEP] All 102 people on board died, making it the deadliest aviation accident involving a Boeing 737-400. [CLS] [SEP] A national investigation was launched into the disaster. [CLS] [SEP] The final report, released on 25 March 2008, concluded that the pilots lost control of the aircraft after they became preoccupied with troubleshooting the inertial navigation system and inadvertently disconnected the autopilot.
