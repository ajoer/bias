Hurricane Carrie was the strongest tropical cyclone of the 1957 Atlantic hurricane season. [CLS] [SEP] The third named storm and second hurricane of the year, Carrie formed from an easterly tropical wave off the western coast of Africa on September 2, a type of tropical cyclogenesis typical of Cape Verde-type hurricanes. [CLS] [SEP] Moving to the west, the storm gradually intensified, reaching hurricane strength on September 5. [CLS] [SEP] Carrie intensified further, before reaching peak intensity on September 8 as a Category 4 hurricane with maximum sustained winds of 140 mph (220 km/h) in the open Atlantic Ocean. [CLS] [SEP] The hurricane curved northwards and fluctuated in intensity as it neared Bermuda on September 14. [CLS] [SEP] However, Carrie passed well north of the island and turned to the northeast towards Europe. [CLS] [SEP] Weakening as it reached higher latitudes, the storm transitioned into an extratropical cyclone on September 23, prior to affecting areas of the British Isles, and subsequently dissipated on September 28. [CLS] [SEP] Due to its distance away from any major land masses, Carrie caused relatively minor damage along its path. [CLS] [SEP] On September 16, the hurricane passed well north of Bermuda, causing minimal damage despite its intensity at the time, though hurricane reconnaissance flights in the area were postponed due to damage sustained by one of the aircraft. [CLS] [SEP] As it was transitioning to an extratropical cyclone southwest of the Azores, the German ship Pamir encountered the storm and capsized on September 21, resulting in the deaths of 80 crew members on board. [CLS] [SEP] As an extratropical storm, Carrie brought strong storm surge and heavy rain to the British Isles, which claimed three lives. [CLS] [SEP] The hurricane's long duration and path in open water also helped it attain a number of Atlantic hurricane records. [CLS] [SEP]
