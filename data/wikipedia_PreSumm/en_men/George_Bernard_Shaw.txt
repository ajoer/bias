[CLS] George Bernard Shaw (; 26 July 1856 – 2 November 1950), known at his insistence simply as Bernard Shaw, was an Irish playwright, critic, polemicist and political activist. [SEP] [CLS] His influence on Western theatre, culture and politics extended from the 1880s to his death and beyond. [SEP] [CLS] He wrote more than sixty plays, including major works such as Man and Superman (1902), Pygmalion (1912) and Saint Joan (1923). [SEP] [CLS] With a range incorporating both contemporary satire and historical allegory, Shaw became the leading dramatist of his generation, and in 1925 was awarded the Nobel Prize in Literature. [SEP] [CLS] Born in Dublin, Shaw moved to London in 1876, where he struggled to establish himself as a writer and novelist, and embarked on a rigorous process of self-education. [SEP] [CLS] By the mid-1880s he had become a respected theatre and music critic. [SEP] [CLS] Following a political awakening, he joined the gradualist Fabian Society and became its most prominent pamphleteer. [SEP] [CLS] Shaw had been writing plays for years before his first public success, Arms and the Man in 1894. [SEP] [CLS] Influenced by Henrik Ibsen, he sought to introduce a new realism into English-language drama, using his plays as vehicles to disseminate his political, social and religious ideas. [SEP] [CLS] By the early twentieth century his reputation as a dramatist was secured with a series of critical and popular successes that included Major Barbara, The Doctor's Dilemma and Caesar and Cleopatra. [SEP] [CLS] Shaw's expressed views were often contentious; he promoted eugenics and alphabet reform, and opposed vaccination and organised religion. [SEP] [CLS] He courted unpopularity by denouncing both sides in the First World War as equally culpable, and although not a republican, castigated British policy on Ireland in the postwar period. [SEP] [CLS] These stances had no lasting effect on his standing or productivity as a dramatist; the inter-war years saw a series of often ambitious plays, which achieved varying degrees of popular success. [SEP] [CLS] In 1938 he provided the screenplay for a filmed version of Pygmalion for which he received an Academy Award. [SEP] [CLS] His appetite for politics and controversy remained undiminished; by the late 1920s he had largely renounced Fabian Society gradualism and often wrote and spoke favourably of dictatorships of the right and left—he expressed admiration for both Mussolini and Stalin. [SEP] [CLS] In the final decade of his life he made fewer public statements, but continued to write prolifically until shortly before his death, aged ninety-four, having refused all state honours, including the Order of Merit in 1946. [SEP] [CLS] Since Shaw's death scholarly and critical opinion about his works has varied, but he has regularly been rated among British dramatists as second only to Shakespeare; analysts recognise his extensive influence on generations of English-language playwrights. [SEP] [CLS] The word Shavian has entered the language as encapsulating Shaw's ideas and his means of expressing them. [SEP] [CLS]
