[CLS] Hurricane Walaka ( ua-la-ka; Hawaiian: Ê»walaka meaning "ruler of the army") was one of the most intense hurricanes on record for the Central Pacific Basin. [SEP] [CLS] By minimum pressure, Walaka is the second-strongest tropical cyclone in central Pacific, alongside Hurricane Gilma in 1994, and is only surpassed by Hurricane Ioke in 2006. [SEP] [CLS] The nineteenth named storm, twelfth hurricane, eighth major hurricane, and second Category 5 hurricane of the 2018 Pacific hurricane season, Walaka originated from an area of low pressure that formed over a thousand miles south-southeast of Hawaii on September 25. [SEP] [CLS] The National Hurricane Center tracked the disturbance for another day or so before it moved into the Central Pacific Basin. [SEP] [CLS] The Central Pacific Hurricane Center monitored the disturbance from that time until September 29, when the system organized into Tropical Storm Walaka. [SEP] [CLS] Walaka gradually strengthened, becoming a hurricane on October 1. [SEP] [CLS] Walaka then began to rapidly intensify, reaching Category 5 intensity by early on October 2. [SEP] [CLS] An eyewall replacement cycle caused some weakening of the hurricane, though it remained a powerful storm for the next day or so. [SEP] [CLS] Afterward, less favorable conditions caused a steady weakening of the hurricane, and Walaka became extratropical on October 6, well to the north of the Hawaiian Islands. [SEP] [CLS] The storm's remnants then accelerated northeastward, before dissipating on October 9. [SEP] [CLS] Although the hurricane did not impact any major landmasses, it passed very close to the unpopulated Johnston Atoll as a strong Category 4 hurricane, where a hurricane warning was issued in advance of the storm. [SEP] [CLS] Four scientists there intended to ride out the storm on the island, but were then evacuated before the storm hit. [SEP] [CLS] Walaka then neared the far Northwestern Hawaiian Islands, but weakened considerably as it did so. [SEP] [CLS] East Island in the French Frigate Shoals suffered a direct hit and was completely destroyed. [SEP] [CLS]
