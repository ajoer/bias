Cecil John Rhodes (5 July 1853 â€“ 26 March 1902) was a British mining magnate, and politician in southern Africa who served as Prime Minister of the Cape Colony from 1890 to 1896. [CLS] [SEP] An ardent believer in British imperialism, Rhodes and his British South Africa Company founded the southern African territory of Rhodesia (now Zimbabwe and Zambia), which the company named after him in 1895. [CLS] [SEP] South Africa's Rhodes University is also named after him. [CLS] [SEP] Rhodes set up the provisions of the Rhodes Scholarship, which is funded by his estate. [CLS] [SEP] He also put much effort towards his vision of a Cape to Cairo Railway through British territory.The son of a vicar, Rhodes was born at Netteswell House, Bishop's Stortford, Hertfordshire. [CLS] [SEP] He was a sickly child. [CLS] [SEP] He was sent to South Africa by his family when he was 17 years old in the hope that the climate might improve his health. [CLS] [SEP] He entered the diamond trade at Kimberley in 1871, when he was 18, and over the next two decades gained near-complete domination of the world diamond market. [CLS] [SEP] His De Beers diamond company, formed in 1888, retains its prominence into the 21st century. [CLS] [SEP] Rhodes entered the Cape Parliament at the age of 27 in 1880, and a decade later became Prime Minister. [CLS] [SEP] After overseeing the formation of Rhodesia during the early 1890s, he was forced to resign as Prime Minister in 1896 after the disastrous Jameson Raid, an unauthorised attack on Paul Kruger's South African Republic (or Transvaal). [CLS] [SEP] His career never recovered; his heart was weak and after years of poor health he died in 1902. [CLS] [SEP] One of Rhodes's primary motivations in politics and business was his professed belief that the Anglo-Saxon race was, to quote a letter of 1877, "the first race in the world". [CLS] [SEP] Under the reasoning that "the more of the world we inhabit the better it is for the human race", he advocated vigorous settler colonialism and ultimately a reformation of the British Empire so that each component would be self-governing and represented in a single parliament in London. [CLS] [SEP] Historian Richard A. [CLS] [SEP] McFarlane has described Rhodes "as integral a participant in southern African and British imperial history as George Washington or Abraham Lincoln are in their respective eras in United States history." He has been the target of much recent criticism, with some historians attacking him as a ruthless imperialist and white supremacist, and activists demanding that his memorials be removed.
