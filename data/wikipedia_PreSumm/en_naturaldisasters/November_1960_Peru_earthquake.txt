[CLS] The November 1960 Peru earthquake occurred offshore northern Peru on November 20 at 17:02 local time. [SEP] [CLS] The magnitude of the earthquake was put at Ms 6.75 by using the conventional magnitude measurement within a shorter duration of ~20 s. [SEP] [CLS] However, there is a large discrepancy between the magnitudes in Ms and Mw in this earthquake. [SEP] [CLS] The discrepancy was resulted from that the earthquake had a long source duration of about 130 s, and by calculating the seismic moment, the magnitude would be Mw 7.6 or Mw 7.8, according to different sources. [SEP] [CLS] This earthquake belongs to a category of earthquakes with slow rupture velocities and potential of producing tsunamis larger than those expected from the moment magnitudes.This earthquake triggered a tsunami with a height of 9 meters (30 ft) in Puerto Eten, Lambayeque Department. [SEP] [CLS] The tsunami caused damage along the coast of the Lambayeque department. [SEP] [CLS] Three deaths were reported in Lambayeque Department. [SEP] [CLS] Thirteen deaths and 50 missing were reported in Gua√±ape Islands, La Libertad Department. [SEP] [CLS] The tsunami was also observed in Hilo, Hawaii. [SEP] [CLS]
