The 1932 San Ciprián hurricane was one of the strongest tropical cyclones in the history of Puerto Rico. [CLS] [SEP] The center of the storm traversed the island on an east-to-west path in late September 1937, killing 272 people and inflicting at least $35 million in damage. [CLS] [SEP] Winds in San Juan, Puerto Rico, were estimated to have reached at least 120 mph (195 km/h), causing extensive destruction. [CLS] [SEP] The storm's origins can be traced back to at least September 25, 1932, when it was a tropical storm east of the Windward Islands. [CLS] [SEP] Moving west as a compact tropical cyclone, it rapidly intensified as it moved across the Virgin Islands the following day before ultimately making landfall on September 27 in Ceiba, Puerto Rico, at a peak intensity equivalent to that of a Category 4 hurricane on the modern Saffir–Simpson scale. [CLS] [SEP] The hurricane diminished for the remainder of its duration, leaving Puerto Rico and brushing the southern coast of Hispaniola. [CLS] [SEP] The cyclone passed near Jamaica on September 29 and moved ashore British Honduras on October 1 as a tropical storm, dissipating the next day over southeastern Mexico. [CLS] [SEP] The hurricane brought strong winds to parts of the Virgin Islands. [CLS] [SEP] In Saint Thomas, wires and trees were blown down and homes were damaged. [CLS] [SEP] Ships also sank in the Saint Thomas harbor, as well as at Tortola. [CLS] [SEP] Property losses on Saint Thomas were estimated to have exceeded $200,000 and 15 people were killed. [CLS] [SEP] Most of the damage caused by the San Ciprián hurricane occurred in Puerto Rico, particularly along the island's northern half. [CLS] [SEP] The powerful winds caused the destruction of numerous buildings. [CLS] [SEP] Over 40,000 homes were destroyed throughout the U.S. [CLS] [SEP] territory, contributing to a $15.6 million property damage toll and rendering 25,000 families homeless. [CLS] [SEP] Heavy losses were wrought upon crops, particularly to citrus and coffee. [CLS] [SEP] The hurricane killed 257 people in Puerto Rico and injured another 4,820. [CLS] [SEP] Economic losses stemming from the devastation were equivalent to 20 percent of Puerto Rico's gross income. [CLS] [SEP]
