[CLS] Anna Nahowski (1860–1931) was the mistress of Franz Joseph of Austria from 1875 until 1889. [SEP] [CLS] She was from the age of fourteen married to the silk manufacturer Heuduck, who was heavily indebted by gambling and alcoholism. [SEP] [CLS] She met Franz Joseph at a walk in the park of Schönbrunn. [SEP] [CLS] The relationship was arranged between Anna and Franz Joseph without the knowledge of her spouse. [SEP] [CLS] Franz Joseph visited her discreetly and regularly while her husband (whose debts were paid) was away. [SEP] [CLS] This arrangement continued also after she remarried the decadent Franz Nahowski. [SEP] [CLS] In 1889, Nahowski discovered that Franz Joseph was in parallel involved, and this time more publicly, with Katharina Schratt, which made Franz Joseph end the relationship to Nahowski. [SEP] [CLS] Anna Nahowski was given economic compensation for both herself and her children (whose paternity is uncertain) in exchange for signing a contract of silence. [SEP] [CLS] Her daughter Helene, who is believed to have been the emperor's, was the wife of the composer Alban Berg. [SEP] [CLS] Her diary was published in 1976. [SEP] [CLS]
