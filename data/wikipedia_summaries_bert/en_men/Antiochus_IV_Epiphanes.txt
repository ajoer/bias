[CLS] Antiochus IV Epiphanes (; Ancient Greek: Ἀντίοχος ὁ Ἐπιφανής, Antíochos ho Epiphanḗs, "God Manifest"; c. [SEP] [CLS] 215 BC – November/December 164 BC) was a Hellenistic king of the Seleucid Empire from 175 BC until his death in 164 BC. [SEP] [CLS] He was a son of King Antiochus III the Great. [SEP] [CLS] His original name was Mithradates (alternative form Mithridates); he assumed the name Antiochus after he ascended the throne. [SEP] [CLS] Notable events during the reign of Antiochus IV include his near-conquest of Egypt, his persecution of the Jews of Judea and Samaria, and the rebellion of the Jewish Maccabees. [SEP] [CLS] Antiochus was the first Seleucid king to use divine epithets on coins, perhaps inspired by the Bactrian Hellenistic kings who had earlier done so, or else building on the ruler cult that his father Antiochus the Great had codified within the Seleucid Empire. [SEP] [CLS] These epithets included Θεὸς Ἐπιφανής "manifest god", and, after his defeat of Egypt, Νικηφόρος "bringer of victory". [SEP] [CLS] However, Antiochus also tried to interact with common people by appearing in the public bath houses and applying for municipal offices, and his often eccentric behavior and capricious actions led some of his contemporaries to call him Epimanes ("The Mad One"), a word play on his title Epiphanes.
