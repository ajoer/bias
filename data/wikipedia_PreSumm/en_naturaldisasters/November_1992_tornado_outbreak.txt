[CLS] The Tornado outbreak of November 1992, sometimes referred to as The Widespread Outbreak (as was the 1974 Super Outbreak initially), was a devastating, three-day outbreak that struck the Eastern and Midwestern United States on November 21-23. [SEP] [CLS] This exceptionally long-lived and geographically large outbreak produced 95 tornadoes over a 41 hour period, making it one of the longest-lasting and largest outbreaks ever recorded in the US, and published studies of the outbreak have indicated the possibility of even more tornadoes (92, 94, 146 and 143, with higher numbers reflected in NOAA studies). [SEP] [CLS] There were 26 fatalities, 641 injuries, and over $300 million in damage. [SEP] [CLS]
