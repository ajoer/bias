Tropical Storm Felice was a modest tropical cyclone that lightly affected parts of the Gulf Coast of the United States in mid-September 1970. [CLS] [SEP] Spawned by an upper-level trough over the Bahamas, the system crossed the Florida Keys and entered the Gulf of Mexico, where it gradually began to strengthen. [CLS] [SEP] Felice was a disorganized storm for its entire duration, plagued by dry air, a lack of deep thunderstorm activity, and an ill-defined center of circulation, but nevertheless managed to peak as a high-end tropical storm with winds just below Category 1 hurricane strength. [CLS] [SEP] Tracking northwestward, the storm brushed southern Louisiana on September 15 before making landfall northeast of Galveston, Texas, late that same day. [CLS] [SEP] Once ashore, Felice quickly deteriorated as it recurved into the central United States. [CLS] [SEP] While over southeastern Oklahoma, however, its remnants still closely resembled a formidable tropical cyclone. [CLS] [SEP] In advance of the cyclone, officials prompted residents in vulnerable communities to leave their homes, and temporary storm shelters were established. [CLS] [SEP] However, the effects from Felice were generally light. [CLS] [SEP] Beneficial rains fell over parts of southern Florida, while sections of coastal Louisiana experienced minimal gale-force winds and above-normal tides. [CLS] [SEP] Winds gusting to 55 mph (89 km/h) at Galveston—and estimated near 70 mph (110 km/h) elsewhere—caused scattered power outages and minor tree damage, while heavy rainfall totaling over 6 in (150 mm) triggered some street flooding. [CLS] [SEP] Felice delayed the local rice harvest and damaged some hay that had been cut before the storm. [CLS] [SEP] Significant precipitation and gusty winds accompanied the system into northern Texas and Oklahoma. [CLS] [SEP] Overall, the storm left no fatalities or widespread property damage anywhere along its path. [CLS] [SEP]
