[CLS] Hurricane Celia was the costliest tropical cyclone in Texas history until Hurricane Alicia in 1983. [SEP] [CLS] The third named storm, second hurricane, and first major hurricane of the 1970 Atlantic hurricane season, Celia developed from a tropical wave in the western Caribbean Sea on July 31. [SEP] [CLS] Initially, the depression tracked north-northwestward without significantly strengthening, and crossed over western Cuba on August 1. [SEP] [CLS] Heavy rains on the island caused severe flooding, leading to five fatalities. [SEP] [CLS] The depression entered the Gulf of Mexico and was upgraded to Tropical Storm Celia later on August 1. [SEP] [CLS] Due to warm sea surface temperatures, Celia rapidly intensified into a major hurricane on August 1 and after the creation of the Saffirâ€“Simpson hurricane wind scale in 1971 she was estimated to have been a Category 3 storm. [SEP] [CLS] Storm surge and swells lashed the west coast of Florida, especially the Panhandle, causing eight people to drown. [SEP] [CLS] Early on August 2, Celia began to weaken. [SEP] [CLS] However, the storm underwent rapid deepening again and peaked as a Category 3 hurricane with winds of 125 mph (205 km/h) on August 3. [SEP] [CLS] In Louisiana, tides caused minor coastal flooding. [SEP] [CLS] Minor erosion damage was reported along Highway 82 in Cameron Parish. [SEP] [CLS] Late on August 3, Celia made landfall near Corpus Christi, Texas. [SEP] [CLS] Throughout the state, 8,950 homes were destroyed and damaged about 55,650 others. [SEP] [CLS] About 252 small businesses, 331 boats, and 310 farm buildings were either damaged or destroyed. [SEP] [CLS] Impact was the worst in Nueces County, which observed gusts as high as 180 mph (290 km/h). [SEP] [CLS] In Corpus Christi, about one-third of houses suffered severe damage or were destroyed. [SEP] [CLS] Additionally, about 90% of the buildings in downtown were damaged to some degree. [SEP] [CLS] Celia weakened as it continued further inland and dissipated over New Mexico on August 6. [SEP] [CLS] The remnants of Celia brought up to 2 inches (51 mm) of rainfall to the state. [SEP] [CLS] Overall, this storm caused 28 deaths and $930 million (1970 USD) in damage. [SEP] [CLS]
