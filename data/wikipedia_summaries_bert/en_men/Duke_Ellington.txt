[CLS] Edward Kennedy "Duke" Ellington (April 29, 1899 â€“ May 24, 1974) was an American composer, pianist, and leader of a jazz orchestra, which he led from 1923 until his death over a career spanning more than six decades.Born in Washington, D.C., Ellington was based in New York City from the mid-1920s onward and gained a national profile through his orchestra's appearances at the Cotton Club in Harlem. [SEP] [CLS] In the 1930s, his orchestra toured in Europe.
