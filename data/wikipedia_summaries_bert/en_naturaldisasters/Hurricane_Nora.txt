Hurricane Nora was only the third tropical cyclone on record to reach Arizona as a tropical storm, and one of the rare cyclones to make landfall in Baja California. [CLS] [SEP] Nora was the fourteenth named tropical cyclone and seventh hurricane of the 1997 Pacific hurricane season. [CLS] [SEP] The September storm formed off the Pacific coast of Mexico, and aided by waters warmed by the 1997–98 El Niño event, eventually peaked at Category 4 intensity on the Saffir–Simpson hurricane scale. [CLS] [SEP] Nora took an unusual path, making landfall twice as a hurricane in the Baja California Peninsula. [CLS] [SEP] Weakening quickly after landfall, its remnants lashed the Southwestern United States with tropical-storm-force winds, torrential rain and flooding. [CLS] [SEP] The storm was blamed for two direct casualties in Mexico, as well as substantial beach erosion on the Mexican coast, flash flooding in Baja California, and record precipitation in Arizona. [CLS] [SEP] It persisted far inland and eventually dissipated near the Arizona–Nevada border. [CLS] [SEP]
