[CLS] The 1755 Cape Ann earthquake took place off the coast of the British Province of Massachusetts Bay (present-day Massachusetts) on November 18. [SEP] [CLS] At between 6.0 and 6.3 on the Richter scale, it remains the largest earthquake in the history of Massachusetts. [SEP] [CLS] No one was killed, but it damaged hundreds of buildings in Boston and was felt as far north as Nova Scotia and as far south as South Carolina. [SEP] [CLS] Sailors on a ship more than 200 miles (320 km) offshore felt the quake, and mistook it at first for their ship running aground. [SEP] [CLS] Many residents of Boston and the surrounding areas attributed the quake to God, and it occasioned a brief increase in religious fervor in the city. [SEP] [CLS] Modern studies estimate that if a similar quake shook Boston today, it would result in as much as $5 billion in damage and hundreds of deaths. [SEP] [CLS] Some discussion has revolved around the idea that this may have been a remotely triggered event. [SEP] [CLS]
