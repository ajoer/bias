[CLS] Typhoon Meranti, known in the Philippines as Typhoon Ferdie, was one of the most intense tropical cyclones on record. [SEP] [CLS] Impacting the Batanes in the Philippines, Taiwan, as well as Fujian Province in September 2016, Meranti formed as a tropical depression on September 8 near the island of Guam. [SEP] [CLS] Tracking to the west northwest, Meranti gradually intensified until September 11, at which point it began a period of rapid intensification. [SEP] [CLS] Continuing to rapidly intensify, it became a super typhoon early on September 12, as it passed through the Luzon Strait, ultimately reaching its peak intensity on September 13 with 1-minute sustained winds of 315 km/h (195 mph). [SEP] [CLS] Shortly afterwards, it passed directly over the island of Itbayat. [SEP] [CLS] Meranti passed to the south of Taiwan as a super typhoon, and began weakening steadily as a result of land interaction. [SEP] [CLS] By September 15, it struck Fujian Province as a Category 2-equivalent typhoon, becoming the strongest typhoon on record to impact the province. [SEP] [CLS] Upon moving inland, rapid weakening ensued and Meranti became extratropical the next day, dissipating shortly afterwards after it passed to the south of the Korean Peninsula. [SEP] [CLS] The island of Itbayat sustained a direct hit from the super typhoon near its peak intensity, severing communications from the island for several days. [SEP] [CLS] No fatalities were reported on the island from the island. [SEP] [CLS] The typhoon caused ₱244.99 million (US$5.16 million) in damage on the island. [SEP] [CLS] However, the most costly and direct impacts were felt in eastern China, where 45 people were killed from floods. [SEP] [CLS] Total economic cost in China reached ¥31.78 billion (US$4.76 billion). [SEP] [CLS] In total, Meranti caused US$4.79 billion in damage and killed 47 people. [SEP] [CLS] During its lifetime, Meranti broke or tied several meteorological records. [SEP] [CLS] With JTWC-estimated 1-minute sustained winds of 315 km/h (195 mph), Meranti is tied with Typhoon Haiyan as the second-strongest tropical cyclone on record by wind speed. [SEP] [CLS] Additionally, in terms of 1-minute sustained winds, the storm's landfall on the island of Itbayat shortly after peak intensity ties it with Haiyan as the strongest landfalling tropical cyclone on record. [SEP] [CLS] The estimated pressure of 890 mbar (26 inHg) was also the lowest on record in the Western Pacific since Typhoon Megi in 2010. [SEP] [CLS]
