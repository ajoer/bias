Dayan Khan (Mongolian: Даян Хаан; Chinese: 達延汗) (given name: Batumöngke; 1464–1517/1543) was a Mongol khan who reunited the Mongols under Chinggisid supremacy in Mongolia during Northern Yuan dynasty. [CLS] [SEP] His reigning title, "Dayan", means the "Great Yuan", as he enthroned himself as Great Khan of the Great Yuan, though the Yuan dynasty, the principal khanate of the Mongol Empire, had already lost control over China a century earlier (1368). [CLS] [SEP] Dayan Khan and his queen, Mandukhai, eliminated Oirat power and abolished the taishi system used by both local and foreign warlords.
