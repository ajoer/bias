[SEP] [CLS] As of August 2020, Flight 3407 is the most recent aviation incident resulting in mass casualties involving a U.S.-based airline.Families of the accident victims lobbied the U.S. [SEP] [CLS] Congress to enact more stringent regulations for regional carriers, and to improve the scrutiny of safe operating procedures and the working conditions of pilots. [SEP] [CLS] Although it did nothing to address the specific causes of the crash – improper stall recovery technique and pilot fatigue – the Airline Safety and Federal Aviation Administrative Extension Act of 2010 (Public Law 111-216) required some of these regulation changes.
