On 8 April 2000, a V-22 Osprey aircraft operated by the United States Marine Corps crashed during a night training exercise at Marana Regional Airport near Tucson, Arizona. [CLS] [SEP] The crash killed all 19 U.S. [CLS] [SEP] Marines on board and intensified debate about the reliability of the Osprey.
