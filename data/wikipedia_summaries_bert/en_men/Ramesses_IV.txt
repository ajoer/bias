Heqamaatre Ramesses IV (also written Ramses or Rameses) was the third pharaoh of the Twentieth Dynasty of the New Kingdom of Ancient Egypt. [CLS] [SEP] His name prior to assuming the crown was Amonhirkhopshef. [CLS] [SEP] He was the fifth son of Ramesses III and was appointed to the position of crown prince by the twenty-second year of his father's reign when all four of his elder brothers predeceased him. [CLS] [SEP] His promotion to crown prince: is suggested by his appearance (suitably entitled) in a scene of the festival of Min at the Ramesses III temple at Karnak, which may have been completed by Year 22 [of his father's reign]. [CLS] [SEP] (the date is mentioned in the poem inscribed there) As his father's chosen successor, the Prince employed three distinctive titles: "Hereditary Prince", "Royal scribe" and "Generalissimo"; the latter two of his titles are mentioned in a text at Amenhotep III's temple at Soleb and all three royal titles appear on a lintel now in Florence, Italy. [CLS] [SEP] As heir-apparent he took on increasing responsibilities; for instance, in Year 27 of his father's reign, he is depicted appointing a certain Amenemope to the important position of Third Prophet of Amun in the latter's TT 148 tomb. [CLS] [SEP] Amenemope's Theban tomb also accords prince Ramesses all three of his aforementioned sets of royal titles. [CLS] [SEP] Due to the three decade long rule of Ramesses III, Ramesses IV is believed to have been a man in his forties when he took the throne. [CLS] [SEP] His rule has been dated to either 1151 to 1145 BC or 1155 to 1149 BC. [CLS] [SEP]
