The 1927 Nova Scotia hurricane (also known as the 1927 Great August Gale or the Great Gale of August 24) was the deadliest tropical cyclone striking Canada in the 20th century. [CLS] [SEP] The first observed storm of the season, this cyclone developed from a tropical wave over the deep tropics of the Atlantic Ocean on August 18. [CLS] [SEP] Initially a tropical storm, it moved west-northwestward and intensified into a Category 1 hurricane on the modern day Saffir–Simpson hurricane wind scale by August 19. [CLS] [SEP] The storm intensified significantly over the next few days, and by August 22, it peaked as a Category 3 hurricane with maximum sustained winds of 125 mph (205 km/h). [CLS] [SEP] Around that time, the system began curving northwestward and later northward. [CLS] [SEP] By August 23, it turned to the north-northeast and then began weakening on August 24. [CLS] [SEP] Thereafter, the storm accelerated toward Atlantic Canada. [CLS] [SEP] Late on August 24, the hurricane struck near Yarmouth, Nova Scotia, as a Category 2 hurricane, just before becoming extratropical. [CLS] [SEP] In New England, rainfall caused minor street flooding, especially in central Massachusetts and Maine, where 2.09 inches (53 mm) of precipitation fell in the city of Portland. [CLS] [SEP] Of the 173–192 fatalities in Canada, most of them occurred due to damaged or missing ships, with two boats losing their entire crew. [CLS] [SEP] On land, Nova Scotia was impacted most significantly. [CLS] [SEP] Heavy rainfall washed out 20–25 percent of the rail lines, which disrupted rail service. [CLS] [SEP] Flooding also damaged numerous roads and swept away bridges, making traveling difficult. [CLS] [SEP] Crop damage from the hurricane was severe as the storm destroyed about half of the fruit, vegetable, and hay harvest, leaving a loss of $1 million (1927 USD). [CLS] [SEP] Property damage in the province was in the thousands of dollars range. [CLS] [SEP] There were many electrical and telephone service outages. [CLS] [SEP] The storm's rains and winds caused similar but less severe damage in the provinces of New Brunswick, Prince Edward Island, and Newfoundland. [CLS] [SEP] Overall, the hurricane caused just under $1.6 million in damage. [CLS] [SEP]
