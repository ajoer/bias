[CLS] Typhoon Fran, known in the Philippines as Typhoon Reming, produced tremendous rainfall in Japan including, at the time, a national 24-hour record accumulation of 1,140 mm (44.8 in). [SEP] [CLS] Forming as a tropical depression on September 3 to the southeast of Guam, Fran steadily intensified as it moved along a general northwest track.

[SEP] [CLS] A period of explosive intensification ensued thereafter and Fran reached its peak as a Category 4-equivalent typhoon with winds of 240 km/h (150 mph) the following day. [SEP] [CLS] Gradual weakening began on September 8 as it neared the Ryukyu Islands, and the system subsequently meandered near the islands for two days before striking Kyushu on September 12. [SEP] [CLS] It then moved over the Sea of Japan where it transitioned into an extratropical cyclone and ultimately dissipated on September 16. [SEP] [CLS] Regarded as the worst typhoon in ten years, nearly a week of continuous rains caused disastrous flooding and landslides across Japan.
