[CLS] Typhoon Noru was the second-longest-lasting tropical cyclone of the Northwest Pacific Ocean on record—behind only 1986's Wayne and tied with 1972's Rita—and the second-most-intense tropical cyclone of the basin in 2017, tied with Talim. [SEP] [CLS] Forming as the fifth named storm of the annual typhoon season on July 20, Noru further intensified into the first typhoon of the year on July 23. [SEP] [CLS] However, Noru began to interact with nearby Tropical Storm Kulap on July 24, executing a counterclockwise loop southeast of Japan. [SEP] [CLS] Weakening to a severe tropical storm on July 28, Noru began to restrengthen as it turned sharply to the west on July 30. [SEP] [CLS] Amid favorable conditions, Noru rapidly intensified into the season's first super typhoon, and reached peak intensity with annular characteristics on July 31. [SEP] [CLS] In early August, Noru underwent a gradual weakening trend while curving northwestwards and then northwards. [SEP] [CLS] After stalling off the Satsunan Islands weakening to a severe tropical storm again on August 5, the system began to accelerate northeastwards towards the Kansai region of Japan, making landfall in Wakayama Prefecture on August 7. [SEP] [CLS] Noru became extratropical over the Sea of Japan on August 8, and dissipated one day later. [SEP] [CLS] Noru was responsible for two deaths in Kagoshima Prefecture, and at least $100 million (2017 USD) in damages in Japan. [SEP] [CLS]
