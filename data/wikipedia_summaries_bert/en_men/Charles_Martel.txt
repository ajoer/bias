[CLS] [SEP] He was a son of the Frankish statesman Pepin of Herstal and Pepin's mistress, a noblewoman named Alpaida. [CLS] [SEP] Charles, also known as “The Hammer”, successfully asserted his claims to power as successor to his father as the power behind the throne in Frankish politics. [CLS] [SEP] Continuing and building on his father's work, he restored centralized government in Francia and began the series of military campaigns that re-established the Franks as the undisputed masters of all Gaul. [CLS] [SEP] According to a near-contemporary source, the Liber Historiae Francorum, Charles was "a warrior who was uncommonly [...] effective in battle".Most notably, Martel decisively defeated a Muslim invasion of Aquitaine at the Battle of Tours. [CLS] [SEP] This victory is seen as a crucial, historic act of preservation of Western Culture. [CLS] [SEP] Alongside his military endeavours, Charles has been traditionally credited with a seminal role in the development of the Frankish system of feudalism.At the end of his reign, Charles divided Francia between his sons, Carloman and Pepin. [CLS] [SEP] The latter became the first king of the Carolingian dynasty. [CLS] [SEP] Charles' grandson, Charlemagne, extended the Frankish realms, and became the first emperor in the West since the fall of Rome. [CLS] [SEP]
