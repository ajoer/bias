Claudius ( KLAW-dee-əs; Tiberius Claudius Caesar Augustus Germanicus; 1 August 10 BC – 13 October AD 54) was Roman emperor from AD 41 to 54. [CLS] [SEP] Born Tiberius Claudius Drusus to Nero Claudius Drusus and Antonia Minor at Lugdunum in Roman Gaul, where his father was stationed as a military legate, he was the first Roman emperor to be born outside Italy. [CLS] [SEP] Nonetheless, Claudius was an Italic of Sabine origins and a member of the Julio-Claudian dynasty. [CLS] [SEP] Because he was afflicted with a limp and slight deafness due to sickness at a young age, his family ostracized him and excluded him from public office until his consulship, shared with his nephew Caligula in 37. [CLS] [SEP] Claudius' infirmity probably saved him from the fate of many other nobles during the purges of Tiberius' and Caligula's reigns; potential enemies did not see him as a serious threat. [CLS] [SEP] His survival led to his being declared emperor by the Praetorian Guard after Caligula's assassination, at which point he was the last male of his family. [CLS] [SEP] Despite his lack of experience, Claudius proved to be an able and efficient administrator. [CLS] [SEP] He expanded the imperial bureaucracy to include freedmen, and helped to restore the empire's finances after the excess of Caligula's reign. [CLS] [SEP] He was also an ambitious builder, constructing many new roads, aqueducts, and canals across the Empire. [CLS] [SEP] During his reign the Empire started its successful conquest of Britain. [CLS] [SEP] Having a personal interest in law, he presided at public trials, and issued up to twenty edicts a day. [CLS] [SEP] He was seen as vulnerable throughout his reign, particularly by elements of the nobility. [CLS] [SEP] Claudius was constantly forced to shore up his position; this resulted in the deaths of many senators. [CLS] [SEP] These events damaged his reputation among the ancient writers, though more recent historians have revised this opinion. [CLS] [SEP] Many authors contend that he was murdered by his own wife, Agrippina the Younger. [CLS] [SEP] After his death at the age of 63, his grand-nephew and legally adopted step-son Nero succeeded him as emperor. [CLS] [SEP] His 13-year reign (slightly longer than Nero's) would not be surpassed by any successors until that of Domitian, who reigned for 15 years. [CLS] [SEP] He was a descendant of the Octavii Rufi (through Gaius Octavius), Julii Caesares (through Julia Minor and Julia (Mark Antony's mother)), and the Claudii Nerones (through Nero Claudius Drusus). [CLS] [SEP] He was a step-grandson (through his father Drusus) and great-nephew (through his mother Antonia Minor) of Augustus. [CLS] [SEP] Tiberius was his father's brother. [CLS] [SEP] Through his brother Germanicus, Claudius was an uncle of Caligula and a great uncle of Nero. [CLS] [SEP] Through his mother, Antonia Minor, he was also a grandson of Mark Antony and Octavia Minor. [CLS] [SEP]
