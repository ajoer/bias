[CLS] Maurits Cornelis Escher (Dutch pronunciation: [ˈmʌurɪt͡s kɔrˈneːlɪs ˈɛʃər]; 17 June 1898 – 27 March 1972) was a Dutch graphic artist who made mathematically inspired woodcuts, lithographs, and mezzotints. [SEP] [CLS] Despite wide popular interest, Escher was for long somewhat neglected in the art world, even in his native Netherlands. [SEP] [CLS] He was 70 before a retrospective exhibition was held. [SEP] [CLS] In the twenty-first century, he became more widely appreciated, with exhibitions across the world. [SEP] [CLS] His work features mathematical objects and operations including impossible objects, explorations of infinity, reflection, symmetry, perspective, truncated and stellated polyhedra, hyperbolic geometry, and tessellations. [SEP] [CLS] Although Escher believed he had no mathematical ability, he interacted with the mathematicians George Pólya, Roger Penrose, Harold Coxeter and crystallographer Friedrich Haag, and conducted his own research into tessellation. [SEP] [CLS] Early in his career, he drew inspiration from nature, making studies of insects, landscapes, and plants such as lichens, all of which he used as details in his artworks. [SEP] [CLS] He traveled in Italy and Spain, sketching buildings, townscapes, architecture and the tilings of the Alhambra and the Mezquita of Cordoba, and became steadily more interested in their mathematical structure. [SEP] [CLS] Escher's art became well known among scientists and mathematicians, and in popular culture, especially after it was featured by Martin Gardner in his April 1966 Mathematical Games column in Scientific American. [SEP] [CLS] Apart from being used in a variety of technical papers, his work has appeared on the covers of many books and albums. [SEP] [CLS] He was one of the major inspirations of Douglas Hofstadter's Pulitzer Prize-winning 1979 book Gödel, Escher, Bach. [SEP] [CLS]
