[CLS] Very Intense Tropical Cyclone Hellen of March 2014 was one of the most powerful tropical cyclones in the Mozambique Channel on record, as well as the most intense of the 2013–14 South-West Indian Ocean cyclone season. [SEP] [CLS] Hellen formed on March 26 in the northern portion of the channel, and the storm brought rainfall to coastal Mozambique while in its formative stages. [SEP] [CLS] While moving southeastward, it developed an organized area of convection over the center of circulation. [SEP] [CLS] Warm waters allowed Hellen to rapidly intensify while passing south of the Comoros, with a well-defined eye forming in the middle of the thunderstorms. [SEP] [CLS] The cyclone attained peak intensity March 30, with maximum sustained winds estimated 230 km/h (145 mph) according to the Regional Specialized Meteorological Center, Météo-France in La Réunion. [SEP] [CLS] Subsequently, Hellen weakened quickly due to dry air and land interaction with Madagascar, and the storm's eye dissipated. [SEP] [CLS] On March 31, the storm made landfall in northwestern Madagascar as a weakened cyclone, despite previous forecasts for the center to remain over water. [SEP] [CLS] By April 1, Hellen was no longer a tropical cyclone after most of the convection dissipated. [SEP] [CLS] The remnants turned to the west, moving over Mozambique without redeveloping, later dissipating on April 5. [SEP] [CLS] Early in its existence, Hellen's rainfall in Mozambique destroyed hundreds of houses and a bridge. [SEP] [CLS] Flooding killed four people in the country, three of whom due to a home collapsing. [SEP] [CLS] Later, the cyclone passed south of the Comoros islands, causing flooding due to high storm surge and waves that killed one person. [SEP] [CLS] The storm forced 8,956 people to evacuate their homes due to the threat for landslides, while 901 houses were damaged or destroyed. [SEP] [CLS] On nearby Mayotte, high rainfall flooded rivers, sweeping one car away. [SEP] [CLS] In northwestern Madagascar, Hellen damaged or destroyed 611 houses, leaving 1,736 people homeless. [SEP] [CLS] The storm killed three people after capsizing a boat. [SEP] [CLS]
