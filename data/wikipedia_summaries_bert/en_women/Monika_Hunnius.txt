Baron Raimund von zur-Mühlen (sometimes "Raymond", "Raimund von Zur Mühlen") (10 November 1854 in Uusna Manor (Neu-Tennasilm), Viljandi Parish (now in Viiratsi Parish), Viljandi County, Governorate of Livonia – 11 December 1931 in Wiston, near Steyning, England) was a celebrated tenor Lieder singer who also became a famous teacher of singing, instructing many famous artists. [CLS] [SEP] His Lieder-interpretations are legendary. [CLS] [SEP] He was a student of Auguste Hohenschildt, Felix Schmidt, Adolf Schulze, Julius Stockhausen and Clara Schumann. [CLS] [SEP] He made his debut in 1878, together with Hans Schmidt, in Riga. [CLS] [SEP] After this he continued working on his capabilities as a singer, above all with Manuel Garcia, Beniamino Carelli and Pauline Viardot.He is recognised as a founder of the Lieder-abend or evening recital of the German concert Lieder as a distinct performance entity. [CLS] [SEP] His interpretation of Lieder and his specialist study of Lieder interpretation were of the utmost importance in the evolution of the Lieder genre itself. [CLS] [SEP] He gave Schumann Lieder-recitals with Clara Schumann. [CLS] [SEP] She set him on the path to London, where he gave his first concert in 1883. [CLS] [SEP] At one of his concerts, Johannes Brahms shouted out, 'Endlich, endlich habe ich meinen Sänger gefunden!' (At last, at last, I have found my singer). [CLS] [SEP] Thereafter he spent much time in London. [CLS] [SEP] In 1907 he emigrated to England, with homes in London and Steyning. [CLS] [SEP] His last stay in Germany must have been in 1913–1914 in Berlin, where he gave a course of Masterclasses. [CLS] [SEP] Thereafter he lived in England for the remainder of his life. [CLS] [SEP] Here he met for the last time Monika Hunnius, author and singing-teacher, who had regularly studied with him in 1904–1911 at the Schloss Fellin at Neuhäuser, and developed a deep friendship with him. [CLS] [SEP] In his younger days he usually appeared with his habitual accompanist and kindred spirit Hans Schmidt. [CLS] [SEP] Among his later accompanists were Victor Beigel and Coenraad V. [CLS] [SEP] Bos. [CLS] [SEP] Bos mentions him in his book: the singer gave his young accompanist no encouragement, but criticized him severely. [CLS] [SEP] After their fifth concert together he was told 'You must have played well today, for I did not notice you.' He was the teacher of Lula Mysz-Gmeiner (who taught Elisabeth Schwarzkopf), of Mark Raphael, Hans Lissman, Eva Jekelius-Lissman, Rose Walter, Eidé Norena, Martha Lipton, Georg A. [CLS] [SEP] Walter, Fanny Opfer, Naima Wifstrand, and Hermann Weißenborn, among many others. [CLS] [SEP] He was considered an ideal Lieder singer. [CLS] [SEP] He is also described as an eccentric. [CLS] [SEP] He was born of an aristocratic family. [CLS] [SEP] His valuable collection of documents, musical and artistic papers were destroyed in 1930 in a great fire at his house near Steyning.
