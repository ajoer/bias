[CLS] Cyclone Savannah was a strong tropical cyclone that brought significant impacts to Java and Bali and minor impacts to Christmas Island and the Cocos (Keeling) Islands during March 2019. [SEP] [CLS] It was the sixteenth tropical low, sixth tropical cyclone and third severe tropical cyclone of the 2018–19 Australian region cyclone season. [SEP] [CLS] Savannah developed from a tropical low that formed well to the east of Christmas Island on 8 March. [SEP] [CLS] The system was slow to develop initially, but reached tropical cyclone intensity on 13 March after adopting a southwesterly track. [SEP] [CLS] Savannah underwent rapid intensification and reached peak intensity on 17 March as a Category 4 severe tropical cyclone on the Australian scale. [SEP] [CLS] Ten-minute sustained winds were estimated as 175 km/h (110 mph), with a central barometric pressure of 951 hPa (28.08 inHg). [SEP] [CLS] One-minute sustained winds reached 185 km/h (115 mph) at this time, equivalent to a Category 3 major hurricane on the Saffir-Simpson hurricane wind scale. [SEP] [CLS] Weakening commenced soon afterwards, and responsibility for the system passed from the Australian Bureau of Meteorology to Météo-France. [SEP] [CLS] As it moved into the new region, Savannah became the eighth of a record-breaking ten intense tropical cyclones in the 2018–19 South-West Indian Ocean cyclone season. [SEP] [CLS] Savannah was downgraded to a tropical depression on 20 March, and its remnants dissipated in the central Indian Ocean on 24 March. [SEP] [CLS] Savannah brought significant impacts to Java and Bali early in its lifetime. [SEP] [CLS] Prolonged heavy rainfall and river level rise led to widespread flooding and landslides throughout the region. [SEP] [CLS] Floodwaters impacted scores of villages, causing damage to thousands of homes, submerging thousands of hectares of agricultural land and cutting off access to key infrastructure and services. [SEP] [CLS] Thousands of families were affected during the event, with evacuations occurring both before and after the flooding. [SEP] [CLS] According to local media reports, the total damage and economic losses caused by the disaster exceeded Rp106 billion (US$7.5 million). [SEP] [CLS] Ten people were reported to have died during the event, making Savannah the deadliest tropical cyclone in the Australian region since Tropical Cyclone Cempaka in 2017. [SEP] [CLS] News reports also indicate that at least five people were injured and that one person went missing during the disaster. [SEP] [CLS]
