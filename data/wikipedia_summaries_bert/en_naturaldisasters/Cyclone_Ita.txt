Severe Tropical Cyclone Ita was the strongest tropical cyclone in the Australian region by central pressure, since George in 2007, and since Monica in 2006 by wind speed. [CLS] [SEP] The system was first identified over the Solomon Islands as a tropical low on 1 April 2014, and gradually moved westward, eventually reaching cyclone intensity on 5 April. [CLS] [SEP] On 10 April, Ita intensified rapidly into a powerful Category 5 system on the Australian Scale, but it weakened to a Category 4 system in the hours immediately preceding landfall the following day. [CLS] [SEP] At the time of landfall at Cape Flattery at 12 April 22:00 (UTC+10), the cyclone's Dvorak intensity was approximately T5.0, consistent with a weak Category 4 system, and considerably lower than the T6.5 observed when the system was at its peak intensity. [CLS] [SEP] Meteorologists noted the system had, at that time, begun an eyewall replacement cycle; as a result, the system was considerably less powerful than various intensity scales hadpredicted. [CLS] [SEP] Ita's impact on terrain was lessened, as a result. [CLS] [SEP] Owing to the rapid degradation of the cyclone before landfall, structural damage was relatively low at A$8.4 million (US$7.9 million). [CLS] [SEP] However, the agricultural industry suffered extensive impacts and total losses reached A$1.1 billion (US$1 billion). [CLS] [SEP]
