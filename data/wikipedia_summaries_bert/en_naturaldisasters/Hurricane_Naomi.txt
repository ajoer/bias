[CLS] Hurricane Naomi was a short-lived Category 1 hurricane that made landfall in Mexico's Pacific coast during the 1968 Pacific hurricane season. [SEP] [CLS] After rapidly intensifying before its landfall in Sinaloa, Naomi caused rainfall throughout northern Mexico and the U.S. [SEP] [CLS] state of Texas in association with a frontal system, with the highest measurement occurring in Corpus Christi. [SEP] [CLS] Four people perished in Mexico due to Naomi's effects with ten more missing, all in Sinaloa. [SEP] [CLS] The only reported injury in Texas due to the remnants was a factory worker who was injured when the roof of the plant they were working in collapsed due to rainfall. [SEP] [CLS] Naomi was the seventeenth tropical depression, fourteenth tropical storm and the fourth hurricane of the 1968 Pacific hurricane season. [SEP] [CLS] Its precipitation on the Mexican Altiplano briefly threatened the unfinished Lázaro Cárdenas dam on the Nazas River. [SEP] [CLS] If the dam failed, the twin cities of Gómez Palacio, Durango, and Torreón, Coahuila, would have been inundated. [SEP] [CLS] On the other hand, releasing water from the dam would have saved Torreón by submerging Gómez Palacio with the dam's runoff. [SEP] [CLS] From help with satellite imagery, the authorities decided to keep the dam closed—risking its possible failure—saving both towns. [SEP] [CLS]
