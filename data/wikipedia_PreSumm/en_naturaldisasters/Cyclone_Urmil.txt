[CLS] Tropical Cyclone Urmil (RSMC Nadi designation: 06F, JTWC designation: 07P) was a short lived storm of January 2006 that explosively intensified to reach its peak intensity as a high-end Category 2 cyclone on the Australian Scale, just 12 hours after being named. [SEP] [CLS] Forming out of a tropical disturbance early on January 14, Urmil quickly intensified before weakening just as quickly. [SEP] [CLS] The intensification was a result of the main convective banding feature wrapping around the center of circulation. [SEP] [CLS] However, the combination of high wind shear and the rapid movement of the cyclone caused convection to become separated from the center. [SEP] [CLS] By January 15, the storm transitioned into an extratropical cyclone shortly before dissipating. [SEP] [CLS] Urmil had only minor effects on land; scattered vegetation damage was reported in Tonga. [SEP] [CLS]
