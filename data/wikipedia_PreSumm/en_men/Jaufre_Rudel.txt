[CLS] Jaufre Rudel (Jaufré in modern Occitan) was the Prince of Blaye (Princes de Blaia) and a troubadour of the early–mid 12th century, who probably died during the Second Crusade, in or after 1147. [SEP] [CLS] He is noted for developing the theme of "love from afar" (amor de lonh or amour de loin) in his songs. [SEP] [CLS] Very little is known about his life, but a reference to him in a contemporary song by Marcabru describes him as being oltra mar—across the sea, probably on the Second Crusade in 1147. [SEP] [CLS] Probably he was the son of Girard, also castellan of Blaye, and who was titled "prince" in an 1106 charter. [SEP] [CLS] Girard's father was the first to carry the title, being called princeps Blaviensis as early as 1090. [SEP] [CLS] During his father's lifetime the suzerainty of Blaye was disputed between the Counts of Poitou and the Counts of Angoulême. [SEP] [CLS] Shortly after the succession of William VIII of Poitou, who had inherited it from his father, Blaye was taken by Wulgrin II of Angoulême, who probably vested Jaufre with it. [SEP] [CLS] According to one hypothesis, based on flimsy evidence, Wulgrin was Jaufre's father. [SEP] [CLS] According to his legendary vida, or fictionalised biography, he was inspired to go on Crusade upon hearing from returning pilgrims of the beauty of Countess Hodierna of Tripoli, and that she was his amor de lonh, his far-off love. [SEP] [CLS] The legend claims that he fell sick on the journey and was brought ashore in Tripoli a dying man. [SEP] [CLS] Countess Hodierna is said to have come down from her castle on hearing the news, and Rudel died in her arms. [SEP] [CLS] This romantic but unlikely story seems to have been derived from the enigmatic nature of Rudel's verse and his presumed death on the Crusade. [SEP] [CLS] Seven of Rudel's poems have survived to the present day, four of them with music. [SEP] [CLS] His composition Lanquan li jorn is thought to be the model for the Minnesinger Walther von der Vogelweide's crusade song Allerest lebe ich mir werde (Palästinalied). [SEP] [CLS]
