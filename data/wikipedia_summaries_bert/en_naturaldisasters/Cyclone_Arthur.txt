Severe Tropical Cyclone Wasa–Arthur was the first major tropical cyclone to affect French Polynesia and Tahiti since the 1982–83 season. [CLS] [SEP] The system was first noted on December 3, 1991 as a shallow tropical depression that was embedded within the monsoon trough, to the north of the Cook Island: Rarotonga. [CLS] [SEP] Over the next couple of days the system gradually developed further, before it was classified as a tropical cyclone and named Wasa during December 5. [CLS] [SEP] The system gradually strengthened further and acquired hurricane-force winds on December 6, as it performed a small clockwise loop. [CLS] [SEP] After completing the loop, Wasa moved southwards before it peaked in intensity during December 8, with sustained wind speeds of 165 km/h (105 mph). [CLS] [SEP] Over the next few days the system started to weaken as it passed through the French Polynesian Society Islands, and became the first major tropical cyclone to affect French Polynesia since 1983. [CLS] [SEP] During December 12, Wasa passed through the French Polynesian Austral Islands and passed directly over Tubuai, before it degenerated into a tropical depression later that day. [CLS] [SEP] However, gale-force winds remained associated with the depression, before the system turned towards the east-northeast and entered into warmer waters near the Tuamotu Islands. [CLS] [SEP] During December 14, Wasa regenerated into a tropical depression and was renamed Arthur for various reasons. [CLS] [SEP] During that day the system gradually intensified before it reached its secondary peak intensity with sustained wind speeds of 95 km/h (60 mph). [CLS] [SEP] During December 15, the system maintained its peak intensity, as it moved through the uninhabited Acteon Group of islands, before during the next day it started to gradually weaken. [CLS] [SEP] Arthur degenerated into a shallow depression during December 17, before it was last noted during the next day as it dissipated to the north of the Pitcairn islands. [CLS] [SEP] Tourists on the island of Bora Bora were evacuated to a local church, after Wasa–Arthur had swept high seas into tourist bungalows. [CLS] [SEP] Overall the system caused an estimated US$60 million in damage within French Polynesia, with the majority of the damage done between December 9 – 12. [CLS] [SEP] The system destroyed or damaged several homes, a variety of crops and damaged several public buildings, hotels, roads and power installations, with the worst affected islands being Bora Bora and Tubuai. [CLS] [SEP] On Rurutu island, Moerai harbour was destroyed by a cyclonic swell generated by the system, while the local school and police station were destroyed by high waves. [CLS] [SEP] Two people were killed after torrential rainfall from the system caused a mudslide on the island of Moorea, during a night of torrential rain the day after Wasa had made its closest approach to the island. [CLS] [SEP] The French Government incurred costs of about FF68 million including FF53 million for the efforts of the French Military. [CLS] [SEP] The French Polynesian Government subsequently borrowed FF55 million and built up a fund from local banks of about FF1.5 billion, to help with the reconstruction. [CLS] [SEP] The name Wasa was later retired, from the list of tropical cyclone names by the World Meteorological Organization. [CLS] [SEP]
