The 1949 Ambato earthquake was the largest earthquake in the Western Hemisphere in more than five years. [CLS] [SEP] On August 5, 1949, it struck Ecuador's Tungurahua Province southeast of its capital Ambato and killed 5,050 people. [CLS] [SEP] Measuring 6.4 on the Ms scale, it originated from a hypocenter 15 km beneath the surface. [CLS] [SEP] The nearby villages of Guano, Patate, Pelileo, and Pillaro were destroyed, and the city of Ambato suffered heavy damage. [CLS] [SEP] The earthquake flattened buildings and subsequent landslides caused damage throughout the Tungurahua, Chimborazo, and Cotopaxi Provinces. [CLS] [SEP] It disrupted water mains and communication lines and opened a fissure into which the small town of Libertad sank. [CLS] [SEP] Moderate shaking from the event extended as far away as Quito and Guayaquil.Earthquakes in Ecuador stem from two major interrelated tectonic areas: the subduction of the Nazca Plate under the South American Plate and the Andean Volcanic Belt. [CLS] [SEP] The 1949 Ambato earthquake initially followed an intersection of several northwest-southeast-trending faults in the Inter-Andean Valley which were created by the subduction of the Carnegie Ridge. [CLS] [SEP] Strata of rock cracked as the earthquake ruptured the faults, sending out powerful shock waves. [CLS] [SEP] Today threats exist throughout the country from both interplate and intraplate seismicity. [CLS] [SEP]
