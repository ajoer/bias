The 2009 Saudi Arabian floods affected Jeddah, on the Red Sea (western) coast of Saudi Arabia, and other areas of Makkah Province. [CLS] [SEP] They have been described by civil defence officials as the worst in 27 years. [CLS] [SEP] As of 3 January 2010, some 122 people had been reported to have been killed, and more than 350 were missing. [CLS] [SEP] Some roads were under a meter (three feet) of water on 26 November, and many of the victims were believed to have drowned in their cars. [CLS] [SEP] At least 3,000 vehicles were swept away or damaged. [CLS] [SEP] The death toll was expected to rise as flood waters receded, allowing rescuers to reach stranded vehicles.More than 70 millimetres (2.76 inches) of rain fell in Jeddah in just four hours on Wednesday 25 November. [CLS] [SEP] This is nearly twice the average for an entire year and the heaviest rainfall in Saudi Arabia in a decade. [CLS] [SEP] The flooding came just two days before the expected date of the Eid al-Adha festival and during the annual Hajj pilgrimage to nearby Mecca. [CLS] [SEP] Business losses were estimated at a billion riyals (US$270 million). [CLS] [SEP] The poorer neighbourhoods in the south of Jeddah were particularly hard hit, as was the area around King Abdulaziz University.
