Tropical Cyclone Kesiny was the first recorded tropical cyclone – the equivalent of a minimal hurricane – to make landfall in the month of May in the south-west Indian Ocean. [CLS] [SEP] The final named storm of the busy 2001–02 South-West Indian Ocean cyclone season, Kesiny formed on May 2 from a trough near the equator. [CLS] [SEP] Its formation was the result of an increase in the Madden–Julian oscillation, which also contributed to a twin storm in the north Indian Ocean that hit Oman, and another set of storms in northeast and southeast Indian Ocean. [CLS] [SEP] Kesiny initially moved to the southeast, but later turned to the southwest due to a strengthening ridge. [CLS] [SEP] On May 6, it intensified into a tropical cyclone, but later weakened and was not expected to re-strengthen. [CLS] [SEP] However, Kesiny developed an eye and re-intensified into a tropical cyclone on May 9, reaching peak winds of 130 km/h (81 mph) before striking Madagascar about 60 km (37 mi) southeast of Antsiranana. [CLS] [SEP] It weakened while crossing the country, and after turning to the south it struck the country again before dissipating on May 11. [CLS] [SEP] Across Madagascar, Cyclone Kesiny dropped heavy rainfall, reaching 891 mm (35.1 in) in three days at Toamasina, the second largest city in the country. [CLS] [SEP] The rains caused mudslides and flooding in the eastern portion of the country, wrecking the rice and maize crops and leaving 5,000 people homeless. [CLS] [SEP] At least 33 bridges were destroyed, and many roads were damaged. [CLS] [SEP] A total of 33 people were killed, and 1,200 people were injured. [CLS] [SEP] The cyclone struck in the midst of a political crisis, in which the top two candidates of the Malagasy presidential election in 2001 declared themselves the winner; the incumbent, who lost, declared Toamasina as the capital city, and the political instability disrupted relief efforts.
