[CLS] The 1999 Pentecost flood (German: Pfingsthochwasser 1999) was a 100-year flood around the Pentecost season in 1999 that mostly affected Bavaria, Vorarlberg and Tirol. [SEP] [CLS] It was caused by heavy rainfall coinciding with the regular Alpine meltwater. [SEP] [CLS] By late May, the annual spring meltwater from the Alps meant many Bavarian rivers were already at a high water level. [SEP] [CLS] On May 22 the rainstorm "Quartus" hit the northern Alps, bringing an additional 180 litres/m², causing the Ammersee and the Amper and Isar rivers to expand and flood large areas. [SEP] [CLS] These flooded areas expanded quickly covering parts of the Oberallgäu on the river Iller. [SEP] [CLS] The flood then continued downstream to some of the more inhabited areas in Bavaria. [SEP] [CLS] The water level of the Isar, which flows through Munich, was lowered by the Sylvensteinspeicher reservoir near Bad Tölz. [SEP] [CLS] However causeways on the Iller failed, flooding Sonthofen, parts of Augsburg and Neustadt. [SEP] [CLS] In Hindelang-Hinterstein the flood reached a peak not recorded in the previous 250 years. [SEP] [CLS] A subsequent Alpine highwater on 23-24 August 2005 again did damage to these areas. [SEP] [CLS] In the Vorarlberg area the Rhine flood affected Lake Constance damaging Hard and Bregenz. [SEP] [CLS] In Tirol the village Pflach in Lechtal was flooded. [SEP] [CLS]
