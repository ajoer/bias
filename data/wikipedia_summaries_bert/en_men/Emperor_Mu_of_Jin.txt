[CLS] [SEP] While he "reigned" 17 years, most of the years were as a child, with the actual power in such figures as his mother Empress Chu Suanzi, He Chong (何充), his granduncle Sima Yu the Prince of Kuaiji, Yin Hao, and Huan Wen. [CLS] [SEP] It was during his reign that Jin's territory temporarily expanded to its greatest extent since the fall of northern China to Han Zhao, as Huan destroyed Cheng Han and added its territory to Jin's, and Later Zhao's collapse allowed Jin to regain most of the territory south of the Yellow River.
