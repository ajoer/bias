Typhoon Prapiroon, known in the Philippines as Typhoon Lusing, was the costliest tropical cyclone to strike the Korean Peninsula and the eighth costliest in the West Pacific on record. [CLS] [SEP] Prapiroon developed as a tropical depression on August 24, 2000, and took a primarily northerly course for much of its duration, though steering currents caused it to track westward for extended periods of time on two occasions. [CLS] [SEP] Intensification was gradual, and on August 26 the system reached tropical storm status, though the system's organization remained rather loose for much of its early developmental history. [CLS] [SEP] On August 29, Prapiroon swung near Taiwan and East China as it tracked about the western periphery of a nearby high-pressure area. [CLS] [SEP] A day later, the storm reached typhoon intensity within the East China Sea, later attaining peak intensity as a typhoon of moderate strength within the Yellow Sea. [CLS] [SEP] On August 31, a slightly weakened Prapiroon made landfall on North Korea and quickly tracked across the Korean Peninsula, before transitioning into an extratropical cyclone in the Sea of Japan on September 1; the system dissipated east of Hokkaido three days later.
