Cyclone Amara brought stormy conditions to Rodrigues in December 2013. [CLS] [SEP] Amara was the first named storm in the southwest Indian Ocean during the later half of 2013, and developed from a disturbance within the monsoon trough on December 14. [CLS] [SEP] The following day, the system attained tropical depression status. [CLS] [SEP] Despite its ill-defined organization, the depression was able to continue strengthening, reaching moderate tropical storm status on December 16 as it tracked southwest. [CLS] [SEP] Situated in a favorable atmospheric environment, a period of rapid intensification ensued after Amara reached tropical cyclone status on December 18. [CLS] [SEP] After fluctuating in strength, the cyclone peaked with maximum sustained winds of 205 km/h (125 mph) and a minimum barometric pressure of 933 mbar (hPa; 27.55 inHg) on December 21, making it an intense tropical cyclone based on the intensity scale utilized by Météo-France. [CLS] [SEP] Shortly after, wind shear strengthened as Amara tracked southeast, resulting in a weakening phase. [CLS] [SEP] The shearing effects caused the cyclone to rapidly decay, and by December 23, Amara degenerated into a remnant low. [CLS] [SEP] Amara was initially expected to track directly over the island of Rodrigues, prompting widespread precautionary measures and resulting in the issuance of a Class 4 warning – denoting a warning of highest urgency – by the Mauritius Meteorological Services. [CLS] [SEP] Though the tropical cyclone eventually passed to the east of the island, Amara was close enough to Rodrigues to severely effect the island. [CLS] [SEP] Strong winds, peaking at a measured 152 km/h (94 mph) in Pointe Canon, resulted in widespread infrastructural damage, including the tearing of metal sheeting and uprooting of trees. [CLS] [SEP] Widespread power outage cut power to 12,000 homes and shut off communications to and from the island. [CLS] [SEP] Heavy rains produced by Amara also triggered flooding in some locations and caused soil erosion. [CLS] [SEP]
