The Junkers Ju 52/3m (nicknamed Tante Ju ("Aunt Ju") and Iron Annie) is a transport aircraft that was designed and manufactured by German aviation company Junkers. [CLS] [SEP] Development of the Ju 52 commenced during 1930, headed by German aeronautical engineer Ernst Zindel. [CLS] [SEP] The aircraft's design incorporated a corrugated duralumin metal skin as a strengthening measure, which was very unusual at the time. [CLS] [SEP] The Ju 52's maiden flight was performed on 13 October 1930. [CLS] [SEP] It was initially designed with a single engine, however, it was produced in quantity as a trimotor. [CLS] [SEP] The primary early production model, the Ju 52/3m, was principally operated as a 17-seat airliner or utility transport aircraft by various civil operators during the 1930s. [CLS] [SEP] Following the rise of Nazi Germany, thousands of Ju 52s were procured as a staple military transport of the nation. [CLS] [SEP] The Ju 52/3mg7e was the principal production model. [CLS] [SEP] The Ju 52 was in production between 1931 and 1952. [CLS] [SEP] In a civilian role, it flew with over 12 airlines, including Swissair and Deutsche Luft Hansa, as both a passenger carrier and a freight hauler. [CLS] [SEP] In a military role, large numbers flew with the Luftwaffe, being deployed on virtually all fronts of the Second World War as a troop and cargo transport; it was also briefly used as a medium bomber. [CLS] [SEP] Additionally, the type was deployed by other nation's militaries in conflicts such as the Spanish Civil War, the Chaco War, and the Portuguese Colonial War. [CLS] [SEP] During the postwar era, the Ju 52 had a lengthy service life with numerous military and civilian operators; large numbers were still in use by the 1980s. [CLS] [SEP] Even in the 21st century, several aircraft have remained operational, typically used for purposes such as heritage aviation displays and aerial sightseeing. [CLS] [SEP]
