[CLS] The 1914 Burdur earthquake occurred at 00:07 local time (22:07 UTC) on 4 October. [SEP] [CLS] It was estimated to be 7.0 on the surface wave magnitude scale with a maximum intensity of IX (Violent) on the Mercalli intensity scale. [SEP] [CLS] It was centered near Lake Burdur in southwestern Turkey and the mainshock and subsequent fire destroyed more than 17,000 homes, and caused 2,344 casualties. [SEP] [CLS] In Burdur nearly 100 percent of the homes were destroyed along with other significant and historical monuments.

[SEP] [CLS] Other villages were also impacted as far as 60 kilometers (37 mi) from the epicenter.The earthquake, along with several others in 1959 and 1971, occurred along the Fethiye-Burdur fault zone, a parallel and discontinuous series of fault segments. [SEP] [CLS] No unambiguous fault displacement has been found that is related to the event, but a 23 km (14 mi) portion of the southeast coast of Lake Burdur experienced subsidence of up to 150 centimeters (59 in) and this may indicate that the event was due to normal faulting with a strike of N45Â°E.
