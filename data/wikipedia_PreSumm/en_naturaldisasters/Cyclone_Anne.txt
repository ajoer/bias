[CLS] Severe Tropical Cyclone Anne was one of the most intense tropical cyclones within the South Pacific basin during the 1980s. [SEP] [CLS] The cyclone was first noted on January 5, 1988 as a weak tropical depression to the northeast of Tuvalu, in conjunction with the future Typhoon Roy in the Northern Hemisphere. [SEP] [CLS] Over the next few days, the system gradually developed while moving southwestward. [SEP] [CLS] Once it became a tropical cyclone, it was named Anne on January 8. [SEP] [CLS] The next day, Anne rapidly intensified, becoming the fourth major tropical cyclone to affect Vanuatu within four years. [SEP] [CLS] On January 11, Anne peaked in intensity while it was equivalent to a Category 5 on the Saffirâ€“Simpson hurricane wind scale, and a Category 4 on the Australian tropical cyclone intensity scale. [SEP] [CLS] After turning southward on January 12, Anne struck New Caledonia, becoming the strongest tropical cyclone to affect the French Overseas Territory. [SEP] [CLS] The system subsequently weakened as it started to interact with Tropical Cyclone Agi. [SEP] [CLS] Anne weakened into a depression and was last noted on January 14 to the south-east of New Caledonia. [SEP] [CLS] Several islands within the Solomon Islands reported extensive property and crop damage. [SEP] [CLS] Within Vanuatu, Anne brought heavy rains, flooding, and a storm surge. [SEP] [CLS] These effects damaged houses, crops, and property, especially on Ureparapara islands and the Torres Islands. [SEP] [CLS] Extensive damage was reported in New Caledonia after it was exposed to a prolonged period of storm force winds, with the eastern and southern coasts particularly affected. [SEP] [CLS] On January 12, the system produced the highest daily rainfall totals since 1951 in several areas. [SEP] [CLS] Two people were killed after they attempted to cross a flooded river, and about 80 others were injured by the cyclone. [SEP] [CLS] Due to the impact of this storm, the name Anne was retired. [SEP] [CLS]
