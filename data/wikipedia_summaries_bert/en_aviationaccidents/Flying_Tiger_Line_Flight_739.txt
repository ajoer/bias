Flying Tiger Line Flight 739 was a Lockheed L-1049 Super Constellation propliner chartered by the United States military that disappeared on March 16, 1962, over the Western Pacific Ocean. [CLS] [SEP] The aircraft was transporting 93 U.S. [CLS] [SEP] soldiers and 3 South Vietnamese from Travis Air Force Base, California to Saigon, Vietnam. [CLS] [SEP] After refueling at Andersen Air Force Base, Guam, the Super Constellation was en route to Clark Air Base in the Philippines when it disappeared. [CLS] [SEP] All 107 aboard were declared missing and presumed dead. [CLS] [SEP] The airliner's disappearance prompted one of the largest air and sea searches in the history of the Pacific. [CLS] [SEP] Aircraft and surface ships from four branches of the U.S. [CLS] [SEP] military searched more than 200,000 square miles (520,000 km2) during the course of eight days. [CLS] [SEP] A civilian tanker observed what appeared to be an in-flight explosion believed to be the missing Super Constellation, though no trace of wreckage or debris was ever recovered. [CLS] [SEP] The Civil Aeronautics Board determined that, based on the tanker's observations, Flight 739 probably exploded in-flight, though an exact cause could not be determined without examining the remnants of the aircraft. [CLS] [SEP] To date, this remains the worst aviation accident involving the Lockheed Constellation series. [CLS] [SEP]
