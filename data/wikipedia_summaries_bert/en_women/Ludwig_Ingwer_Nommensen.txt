Ludwig Ingwer Nommensen (6 February 1834 – 23 May 1918) was a German Lutheran missionary to Sumatra who also translated the New Testament into the native Batak language. [CLS] [SEP] Stephen Neill, a historian of missions, considered Nommensen one of the greatest missionaries of all time. [CLS] [SEP] He is commemorated as a missionary on November 7 in the Calendar of Saints of the Lutheran Church with John Christian Frederick Heyer and Bartholomäus Ziegenbalg. [CLS] [SEP] Nommensen was born in the Nordstrand peninsula in 1834, when the area was part of Denmark. [CLS] [SEP] In 1846, a horse cart rolled over his legs, crushing them. [CLS] [SEP] The initial prognosis was that he would be unlikely to walk again. [CLS] [SEP] After praying for recovery, some three years later, he was able to walk again. [CLS] [SEP] An interest in Christian missionary work led to Nommensen's enrolment at the Rhenish Missionary Society seminary at Wuppertal-Barmen in 1857. [CLS] [SEP] He was sent as a missionary to Sumatra in 1862. [CLS] [SEP] He focused his attention on the Batak people of the interior of Sumatra. [CLS] [SEP] His first mission station was in the Silindung Valley. [CLS] [SEP] He experienced initial difficulties, but later succeeded in converting several local chiefs and their followers to Christianity. [CLS] [SEP] By 1865 he reported that 2000 Batak had converted to Christianity. [CLS] [SEP] At first most converts had to leave their villages, and came to live with Nommensen in his Huta dame (Village of Peace). [CLS] [SEP] In 1878 he completed the first translation of the New Testament into the Batak language. [CLS] [SEP] In the same year he, his fellow missionaries and the Christian Batak were threatened by the Batak priest king Singamangaraja XII who had gained support from Aceh that was involved in a war against the Dutch occupants. [CLS] [SEP] In the subsequent military expedition against Singamangaraja XII, which became known as the First Toba War, Nommensen played a prominent role in serving the colonial army as an interpreter and cultural consultant. [CLS] [SEP] Nommensen himself laid out his involvement in the war in a report that was published in BRMG 12, 1878:361–81, in which he explained that his involvement was aimed to save lives and to avoid Dutch brutal punitive action against local villages. [CLS] [SEP] After the war Nommensen was seen by Batak people as the one who could protect them against Dutch influence. [CLS] [SEP] In 1890 he moved north to the village of Sigumpar near Laguboti. [CLS] [SEP] The area had greater Islamic influences, but Nommensen remained successful in building an indigenous Batak church. [CLS] [SEP] He had already instituted a church order and hierarchy, overseen by a Batak ephorus. [CLS] [SEP] By the time of his death the church numbered 180,000 members, with 34 Batak pastors and 788 teacher-preachers. [CLS] [SEP] Today most Toba Batak Christians belong to the Huria Kristen Batak Protestan (HKBP) church, one of the largest church denominations in Asia. [CLS] [SEP] He was awarded an honorary doctorate of theology by the University of Bonn, and in 1911 he was made an officer of the Dutch Order of Orange-Nassau. [CLS] [SEP] The Batak Christian University at Medan and Pematang Siantar was named Nommensen University in 1954. [CLS] [SEP] Bishop Stephen Neill, in his History of Christian Missions, describes Nommensen as “one of the most powerful missionaries of whom we have record anywhere” (page 348). [CLS] [SEP] Another source writes, “Nommensen may have been one of the most successful missionaries ever to preach the gospel” (Ambassadors for Christ, ed by J. [CLS] [SEP] Woodbridge, page 146).
