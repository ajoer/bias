Hurricane Ella was the strongest hurricane on record in Canadian waters. [CLS] [SEP] It formed on August 30, 1978 to the south of Bermuda, and quickly intensified as it tracked west-northwestward. [CLS] [SEP] By September 1, Ella reached winds of 125 mph (205 km/h), and it was expected to pass close to the Outer Banks of North Carolina during the busy Labor Day Weekend. [CLS] [SEP] The hurricane became stationary for about 24 hours, and later turned to the northeast away from the coast. [CLS] [SEP] On September 4, Ella reached Category 4 status on the Saffir-Simpson Hurricane Scale off the coast of Nova Scotia. [CLS] [SEP] It subsequently weakened, passing southeast of Newfoundland before being absorbed by a large extratropical cyclone. [CLS] [SEP] In North Carolina, the National Hurricane Center issued a hurricane watch due to the large influx of people expected during the holiday weekend. [CLS] [SEP] As such, there was a significant drop in tourism, although no significantly adverse weather occurred along the Outer Banks. [CLS] [SEP] High waves and some minor beach erosion was reported, but there were no deaths, injuries, or damage from Ella. [CLS] [SEP] By the time the hurricane passed Newfoundland, the strongest winds were to the southeast of the center, and as a result, no significant impact was reported on Canada. [CLS] [SEP]
