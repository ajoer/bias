[CLS] The catastrophe du Boël (disaster of Boël) was a landslide that occurred on June 6, 1884 in a quarry at a place named Le Boël in Bruz, Ille-et-Vilaine, in the west of France. [SEP] [CLS] The landslide killed eight people including two children. [SEP] [CLS] Groundwater that weakened the cliff and damage caused by explosives used to remove red shale (found as a construction material in the local churches) from the quarry were the principle causes of the accident. [SEP] [CLS] The search to recover the bodies took five days. [SEP] [CLS] At the time, the event left its mark, probably because of the death of the children and because it impacted different social classes. [SEP] [CLS] Editors of several newspapers from Rennes collaborated and sold a magazine at 50 cents apiece to benefit the victims. [SEP] [CLS] Donation campaigns were also carried out by the local press. [SEP] [CLS]
