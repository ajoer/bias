Walter Dix (born January 31, 1986) is a retired American sprinter who specialized in the 100 meters and 200 meters. [CLS] [SEP] He is the fifth-fastest 200-meter runner ever with a best of 19.53 seconds, and has broken the 10-second barrier in the 100 meters, with a best of 9.88 (9.80w) seconds. [CLS] [SEP] Dix was a highly successful amateur athlete, setting a state record in the 100 m and trying out for the US Olympic Team at the age of eighteen. [CLS] [SEP] He joined Florida State University and in his first year he broke the 100 m American junior record and won at the NCAA Outdoor Championships. [CLS] [SEP] After a fourth-place finish at the 2005 US Championships, Dix continued with his collegiate success, setting an NCAA record of 19.69 seconds in the 200 m and coming within one hundredth of the 100 m record.
