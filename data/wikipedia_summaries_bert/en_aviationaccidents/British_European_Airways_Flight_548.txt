[CLS] British European Airways Flight 548 was a scheduled passenger flight from London Heathrow to Brussels that crashed near the town of Staines, Surrey, England, soon after take-off on 18 June 1972, killing all 118 people on board. [SEP] [CLS] The accident became known as the Staines air disaster. [SEP] [CLS] As of 2020, it remains the deadliest air accident (as opposed to terrorist incidents) in the United Kingdom and was the deadliest air accident involving a Hawker Siddeley Trident. [SEP] [CLS] The aircraft suffered a deep stall in the third minute of its flight and crashed to the ground, narrowly missing a busy main road. [SEP] [CLS] The inquest principally blamed the captain for failing to maintain airspeed and configure the high-lift devices correctly. [SEP] [CLS] It also cited the captain's heart condition and the limited experience of the co-pilot, while noting an unspecified "technical problem" that the crew apparently resolved before take-off. [SEP] [CLS] The crash took place against the background of a pilots' strike that had caused bad feelings between crew members. [SEP] [CLS] The strike had also disrupted services, causing Flight 548 to be loaded with the maximum weight allowable. [SEP] [CLS] Recommendations from the inquiry led to the mandatory installation of cockpit voice recorders in British-registered airliners. [SEP] [CLS] Another recommendation was for greater caution before allowing off-duty crew members to occupy flight deck seats. [SEP] [CLS] Some observers felt that the inquiry was unduly biased in favour of the aircraft's manufacturers. [SEP] [CLS]
