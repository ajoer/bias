Tropical Cyclone Sose was a moderate storm system that chiefly impacted the island nation of Vanuatu in early April 2001. [CLS] [SEP] The developing cyclone was first detected on April 3, while situated well to the northeast of Vanuatu. [CLS] [SEP] As atmospheric conditions became more conducive to intensification, the disturbance gradually consolidated as it drifted toward the west-southwest. [CLS] [SEP] After receiving the name Sose on April 5, the cyclone was driven southeastward, passing just west of Espiritu Santo and neighboring islands. [CLS] [SEP] Although it never made landfall, Sose was particularly expansive, producing a wide area of gale-force winds. [CLS] [SEP] The cyclone peaked in strength between April 7 and 8 with maximum 10-minute sustained winds of 110 km/h (70 mph) and 1-minute sustained winds of 130 km/h (80 mph), placing it at Category 2 intensity on the Australian tropical cyclone intensity scale. [CLS] [SEP] Ultimately, stronger wind shear and an increasingly hostile upper-air pattern took their toll on the cyclone as it progressed due south; Sose lost tropical characteristics to the northeast of Norfolk Island by April 12. [CLS] [SEP] The extratropical remnants of Sose continued into the Tasman Sea. [CLS] [SEP] Occurring just two months after Cyclone Paula affected Vanuatu, Sose compounded the damage already done by the previous storm, especially to crops and farmlands. [CLS] [SEP] Throughout the island chain, two people lost their lives to the storm. [CLS] [SEP] Roadways were blocked by debris and floodwaters, while schools and classrooms on several islands were damaged or ruined. [CLS] [SEP] The storm destroyed about 200 homes around the nation and damaged many more, particularly on southern Espiritu Santo. [CLS] [SEP] The storm's large fetch generated enormous swells as far away as Australia's Eastern Seaboard, where surfers took advantage of the abnormally intense conditions and two swimmers drowned. [CLS] [SEP] On Mar√© Island in New Caledonia, a man was swept away by a large wave and presumed dead. [CLS] [SEP] The storm later produced torrential rainfall and strong winds over the North Island of New Zealand, sparking damaging freshwater floods and downing trees and power lines. [CLS] [SEP] Hazardous driving conditions in the Waikato region led to a fatal traffic accident in which three people died. [CLS] [SEP] Another individual drowned in a swollen river. [CLS] [SEP] Sose reportedly contributed to coastal flooding as far away as Tonga. [CLS] [SEP] In all, Sose killed nine people; total monetary damage is unknown. [CLS] [SEP] As a result of the storm's destruction, its name was later retired. [CLS] [SEP]
