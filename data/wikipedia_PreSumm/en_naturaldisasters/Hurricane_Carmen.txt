[CLS] Hurricane Carmen was the most intense tropical cyclone of the 1974 Atlantic hurricane season. [SEP] [CLS] A destructive storm with widespread impacts, Carmen originated as a tropical disturbance that emerged from Africa toward the end of August. [SEP] [CLS] The disturbance traveled westward, spawning a tropical depression east of the Lesser Antilles on August 29. [SEP] [CLS] The storm moved through the Caribbean Sea, and in an environment conducive to intensification, it quickly strengthened to its initial peak intensity as a Category 4 hurricane on the Saffir–Simpson Hurricane Scale. [SEP] [CLS] Carmen moved ashore on the Yucatán Peninsula, where, despite striking a sparsely populated region, it caused significant crop damage and killed several people. [SEP] [CLS] Before the storm's arrival, officials had set up several evacuation centers, and many residents had moved to higher ground. [SEP] [CLS] Upon entering the Gulf of Mexico, Carmen turned northward and re-intensified as it approached the United States. [SEP] [CLS] Initially threatening the major city of New Orleans, it veered westward and made landfall on the marshland of southern Louisiana, eventually dissipating over eastern Texas on September 10. [SEP] [CLS] Tropical cyclone watches and warnings had been issued for the storm, and approximately 100,000 residents left their homes and sought shelter. [SEP] [CLS] Damage was lighter than first feared, but the sugar industry suffered substantial losses. [SEP] [CLS] Throughout its course, the hurricane killed 8 people and caused $162 million in damage. [SEP] [CLS] Due to the severity of the storm, the name Carmen was retired from the list of Atlantic tropical cyclone names. [SEP] [CLS]
