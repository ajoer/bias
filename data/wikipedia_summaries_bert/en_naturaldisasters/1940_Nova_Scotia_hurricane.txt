The 1940 Nova Scotia hurricane swept through areas of Atlantic Canada in mid-September 1940. [CLS] [SEP] The fifth tropical cyclone and fourth hurricane of the year, it formed as a tropical depression east of the Lesser Antilles on September 7, though at the time weather observations in the area were sparse, so its formation was inferred. [CLS] [SEP] The disturbance gradually intensified throughout much of its early formative stages, attaining tropical storm strength on September 10; further strengthening into a hurricane north of Puerto Rico occurred two days later. [CLS] [SEP] Shortly thereafter, the hurricane recurved northward, and reached peak intensity the following day as a Category 2 hurricane with maximum sustained winds of 100 mph (160 km/h) and a minimum barometric pressure of at least 988 mbar (hPa; 29.18 inHg). [CLS] [SEP] The cyclone steadily weakened thereafter before making landfall on Nova Scotia on September 17 with winds of 85 mph (135 km/h). [CLS] [SEP] Moving into the Gulf of Saint Lawrence later that day, the storm transitioned into an extratropical cyclone. [CLS] [SEP] The remnant system curved eastward and passed over Newfoundland before dissipating over the Atlantic on September 19. [CLS] [SEP] While off the United States East Coast, the hurricane caused numerous shipping incidents, most notably the stranding of the Swedish freighter Laponia off Cape Hatteras, North Carolina on September 16. [CLS] [SEP] Two other boat incidents resulted in two deaths. [CLS] [SEP] The hurricane also brought strong winds of tropical storm-force and snow over areas of New England. [CLS] [SEP] In Atlantic Canada, a strong storm surge peaking at 4 ft (1.3 m) above average sunk or damaged several ships and inundated cities. [CLS] [SEP] In New Brunswick, the waves hurt the lobster fishing industry. [CLS] [SEP] In Nova Scotia, strong winds disrupted telecommunication and power services. [CLS] [SEP] The winds also severely damaged crops. [CLS] [SEP] Roughly half of apple production in Annapolis Valley was lost during the storm, resulting in around $1.49 million in economic losses. [CLS] [SEP] Strong winds in New Brunswick caused moderate to severe infrastructural damage, and additional damages to crops occurred there. [CLS] [SEP] Overall, the hurricane caused three fatalities, with two off the United States and one in New Brunswick. [CLS] [SEP]
