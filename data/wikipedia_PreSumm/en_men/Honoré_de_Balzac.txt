[CLS] Honoré de Balzac ( BAL-zak, more commonly US: BAWL-, French: [ɔnɔʁe d(ə) balzak]; born Honoré Balzac; 20 May 1799 – 18 August 1850) was a French novelist and playwright. [SEP] [CLS] The novel sequence La Comédie humaine, which presents a panorama of post-Napoleonic French life, is generally viewed as his magnum opus. [SEP] [CLS] Owing to his keen observation of detail and unfiltered representation of society, Balzac is regarded as one of the founders of realism in European literature. [SEP] [CLS] He is renowned for his multi-faceted characters; even his lesser characters are complex, morally ambiguous and fully human. [SEP] [CLS] Inanimate objects are imbued with character as well; the city of Paris, a backdrop for much of his writing, takes on many human qualities. [SEP] [CLS] His writing influenced many famous writers, including the novelists Émile Zola, Charles Dickens, Gustave Flaubert, and Henry James, filmmaker François Truffaut, and philosophers such as Friedrich Engels and Karl Marx. [SEP] [CLS] Many of Balzac's works have been made into films and continue to inspire other writers. [SEP] [CLS] An enthusiastic reader and independent thinker as a child, Balzac had trouble adapting to the teaching style of his grammar school. [SEP] [CLS] His willful nature caused trouble throughout his life and frustrated his ambitions to succeed in the world of business. [SEP] [CLS] When he finished school, Balzac was apprenticed in a law office, but he turned his back on the study of law after wearying of its inhumanity and banal routine. [SEP] [CLS] Before and during his career as a writer, he attempted to be a publisher, printer, businessman, critic, and politician; he failed in all of these efforts. [SEP] [CLS] La Comédie Humaine reflects his real-life difficulties, and includes scenes from his own experience. [SEP] [CLS] Balzac suffered from health problems throughout his life, possibly owing to his intense writing schedule. [SEP] [CLS] His relationship with his family was often strained by financial and personal drama, and he lost more than one friend over critical reviews. [SEP] [CLS] In 1850, Balzac married Ewelina Hańska, a Polish aristocrat and his longtime love; he died in Paris five months later. [SEP] [CLS]
