[CLS] The 2009 Alaska floods were a series of natural disasters taking place in the United States state of Alaska during April and May 2009. [SEP] [CLS] The floods were a result of heavier-than-normal winter snowfall and above-average spring temperatures that resulted in rapid melting of the winter snowfall. [SEP] [CLS] The resulting high water levels were magnified in places by the development of ice dams which caused catastrophic flooding. [SEP] [CLS] The record-breaking flood that affected Eagle, Alaska in early May is the best example of an ice dam causing flooding beyond the norm. [SEP] [CLS]
