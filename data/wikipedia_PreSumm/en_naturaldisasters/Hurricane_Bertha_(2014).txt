[CLS] Hurricane Bertha was an unusual tropical cyclone in early August 2014 that attained minimal hurricane status, despite having a disheveled appearance and a relatively high atmospheric pressure. [SEP] [CLS] On July 26, a tropical wave south of the Cape Verde Islands was monitored for possible tropical cyclogenesis. [SEP] [CLS] Over the following days, it slowly developed and acquired gale-force winds and enough convection to be designated as Tropical Storm Bertha early on August 1. [SEP] [CLS] A mostly disorganized cyclone, Bertha quickly moved across the Lesser Antilles, clipping the northern end of Martinique, later that day. [SEP] [CLS] During its trek across the eastern Caribbean Sea, its circulation became severely disrupted and it may have degenerated into a tropical wave. [SEP] [CLS] On August 3, it traversed the Mona Passage and moved over the Southeastern Bahamas where conditions favored development. [SEP] [CLS] Despite an overall ragged appearance on satellite imagery, data from Hurricane Hunters indicated it intensified to a hurricane on August 4; it acquired peak winds of 80 mph (130 km/h) that day. [SEP] [CLS] Turning north, and later northeast, Bertha soon weakened as it began to merge with an approaching trough to the west. [SEP] [CLS] This merger ultimately took place on August 6, at which time Bertha was declared extratropical well to the south of Nova Scotia. [SEP] [CLS] The remnant system raced eastward across the Atlantic and later struck the United Kingdom on August 10. [SEP] [CLS] Once over the North Sea, the storm stalled for a few days before resuming its eastward track. [SEP] [CLS] It was last noted around the Baltic Sea on August 16. [SEP] [CLS] As a tropical cyclone, Bertha's impact was relatively minor. [SEP] [CLS] Widespread power outages occurred along its path but no major damage or loss of life took place. [SEP] [CLS] Enhanced swells and rip currents associated with the hurricane resulted in three fatalities and dozens of rescues along the East Coast of the United States. [SEP] [CLS] After becoming an extratropical system, it had significant effects in Western Europe. [SEP] [CLS] Particularly hard hit was the United Kingdom, where wind gusts reached 108 mph (174 km/h). [SEP] [CLS] Unseasonably heavy rains triggered widespread flooding which shut down roads and prompted evacuations. [SEP] [CLS] One fatality took place offshore. [SEP] [CLS] On mainland Europe, a small tornado outbreak resulted in scattered structural damage in Belgium, France, and Germany. [SEP] [CLS]
