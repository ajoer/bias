[CLS] Hurricane San Roque was a destructive tropical cyclone in August 1893 that principally affected Puerto Rico, eastern New England, and Atlantic Canada. [SEP] [CLS] Its informal name in Puerto Rico arises from the feast day of Saint Roch, or San Roque in Spanish, which coincided with the hurricane's landfall on that island. [SEP] [CLS] It was the third known hurricane of the 1893 Atlantic hurricane season. [SEP] [CLS] The system was first observed on August 13 at low latitudes east of the Lesser Antilles. [SEP] [CLS] It grew to be a powerful, slow-moving hurricane in the Caribbean Sea, and on August 17 struck Puerto Rico at the equivalence of Category 3 on the modern-day Saffirâ€“Simpson scale. [SEP] [CLS] The eye crossed the island from southeast to northwest in about seven hours. [SEP] [CLS] A prolonged period of strong winds caused widespread destruction on the island, most notably along the northern coast. [SEP] [CLS] Large numbers of homes sustained varying degrees of damage, with flimsy shacks belonging to poor workers faring the worst; many families were left homeless, and four people were killed. [SEP] [CLS] Telegraph communications were severed across the island. [SEP] [CLS] In addition to the intense winds, several days of heavy rainfall in interior sectors triggered extensive river flooding. [SEP] [CLS] The combined effects of rain and wind destroyed fields of crops, most notably coffee and sugar cane. [SEP] [CLS] On August 19, the hurricane began to turn northeastward, accelerate, and gradually weaken. [SEP] [CLS] Although its center remained far from the United States, heavy rainfall and gale-force winds overspread the country's East Coast on August 20 and 21. [SEP] [CLS] Eastern New England experienced conditions akin to a particularly bad nor'easter, with winds as high as 72 mph (116 km/h) recorded on Block Island. [SEP] [CLS] Across Rhode Island and Massachusetts, grain crops were flattened and orchards were stripped of their fruits. [SEP] [CLS] The racing yacht Volunteer was badly damaged, and a fishing schooner sank off Nantucket; only one of the seven crew members managed to survive, by clinging to debris for 33 hours. [SEP] [CLS] Later that day, the now-rapidly moving cyclone made landfall in Nova Scotia. [SEP] [CLS] Damage to utility wires in Halifax cut power and communications services, and a child was killed by a downed power line. [SEP] [CLS] The storm wrought havoc on ships and boats throughout Atlantic Canada, becoming "one of the most notorious marine storms in the history of Nova Scotia". [SEP] [CLS] The greatest maritime tragedy was the wreck of the steamship Dorcas and its barge, Etta Stewart, which struck a rocky shoal while underway east of Halifax. [SEP] [CLS] Dorcas capsized and was driven ashore, while the barge broke up in the pounding surf. [SEP] [CLS] All crew members and passengers on the two vessels, totaling 24 people, were killed. [SEP] [CLS] Two more people died when their boat sank on Trinity Bay in Newfoundland, for a storm total of 37 fatalities. [SEP] [CLS]
