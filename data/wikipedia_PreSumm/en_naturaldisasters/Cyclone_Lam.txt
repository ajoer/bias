[CLS] Cyclone Lam was the strongest storm to strike Australia's Northern Territory since Cyclone Monica in 2006. [SEP] [CLS] It formed from the monsoon trough on February 12 in the Coral Sea. [SEP] [CLS] For much of its duration, the system moved westward due to a ridge to the south. [SEP] [CLS] The system crossed over the Cape York Peninsula and moved into the Gulf of Carpentaria, whereupon it gradually organized due to warm waters and favorable outflow. [SEP] [CLS] On February 16, the Bureau of Meteorology (BoM) classified it as a Category 1 on the Australian tropical cyclone intensity scale and gave it the name Lam. [SEP] [CLS] The storm intensified further while drifting toward the Wessel Islands, developing an eye and strengthening to the equivalence of a minimal hurricane on February 18. [SEP] [CLS] It strengthened to reach maximum sustained winds of 185 km/h (115 mph) early on February 19 before turning to the southwest, making it a Category 4 cyclone. [SEP] [CLS] That day, it made landfall on Northern Territory between Milingimbi and Elcho Island at peak intensity, and it rapidly weakened over land. [SEP] [CLS] About six hours after Lam moved ashore, Cyclone Marcia struck Queensland as a Category 5 cyclone, marking the first time on record that two storms of Category 4 intensity struck Australia on the same day. [SEP] [CLS] In its formative stages, Lam produced heavy rainfall and flooding in Far North Queensland. [SEP] [CLS] Later, the cyclone's rainfall set daily precipitation records in Northern Territory. [SEP] [CLS] However, the winds caused the most damage, with gusts estimated as high as 230 km/h (145 mph). [SEP] [CLS] The highest gust was 170 km/h (110 mph) at Cape Wessel on Rimbija Island. [SEP] [CLS] Lam caused considerable destruction, particularly affecting local aboriginal communities. [SEP] [CLS] Total damage in the Northern Territory exceeded A$100 million (US$78.1 million).
