Arrow Air Flight 1285 was a McDonnell Douglas DC-8 jetliner that operated as an international charter flight carrying U.S. [CLS] [SEP] troops from Cairo, Egypt, to their home base in Fort Campbell, Kentucky, via Cologne, West Germany, and Gander, Canada.On the morning of Thursday, 12 December 1985, shortly after takeoff from Gander en route to Fort Campbell, the aircraft stalled, crashed, and burned about half a mile from the runway, killing all 248 passengers and 8 crew members on board. [CLS] [SEP] As of 2020, it is the deadliest aviation accident to occur on Canadian soil and the second-deadliest of any accident involving a DC-8, behind the crash of Nigeria Airways Flight 2120 six years later. [CLS] [SEP] The accident was investigated by the Canadian Aviation Safety Board (CASB), which determined the probable cause of the crash was the aircraft's unexpectedly high drag and reduced lift condition, most likely due to ice contamination on the wings' leading edges and upper surfaces, as well as underestimated onboard weight. [CLS] [SEP] A minority report stated that the accident could have been caused by an onboard explosion of unknown origin prior to impact, with one of these dissenting investigators later telling a United States congressional committee that it was impossible for a thin layer of ice to bring down the aircraft. [CLS] [SEP] The dissenting report led to delays in changes to de-icing procedures, with a thin layer of ice causing the deadly crash of Air Ontario Flight 1363 in Canada in 1989. [CLS] [SEP] In response to lack of confidence in accident investigations by the CASB, the Government of Canada shut down that board in 1990, replacing it with an independent, multi-modal investigative agency â€“ the Transportation Safety Board of Canada.
