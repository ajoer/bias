[CLS] James Monroe (; April 28, 1758 – July 4, 1831) was an American statesman, lawyer, diplomat and Founding Father who served as the fifth president of the United States from 1817 to 1825. [SEP] [CLS] A member of the Democratic-Republican Party, Monroe was the last president of the Virginia dynasty; his presidency coincided with the Era of Good Feelings. [SEP] [CLS] He is perhaps best known for issuing the Monroe Doctrine, a policy of opposing European colonialism in the Americas. [SEP] [CLS] He also served as the governor of Virginia, a member of the United States Senate, the U.S. [SEP] [CLS] ambassador to France and Britain, the seventh Secretary of State, and the eighth Secretary of War. [SEP] [CLS] Born into a planter family in Westmoreland County, Virginia, Monroe served in the Continental Army during the American Revolutionary War. [SEP] [CLS] After studying law under Thomas Jefferson from 1780 to 1783, he served as a delegate in the Continental Congress. [SEP] [CLS] As a delegate to the Virginia Ratifying Convention, Monroe opposed the ratification of the United States Constitution. [SEP] [CLS] In 1790, he won election to the Senate, where he became a leader of the Democratic-Republican Party. [SEP] [CLS] He left the Senate in 1794 to serve as President George Washington's ambassador to France, but was recalled by Washington in 1796. [SEP] [CLS] Monroe won election as Governor of Virginia in 1799 and strongly supported Jefferson's candidacy in the 1800 presidential election. [SEP] [CLS] As President Jefferson's special envoy, Monroe helped negotiate the Louisiana Purchase, through which the United States nearly doubled in size. [SEP] [CLS] Monroe fell out with his longtime friend James Madison after Madison rejected the Monroe–Pinkney Treaty that Monroe negotiated with Britain. [SEP] [CLS] He unsuccessfully challenged Madison in the 1808 presidential election, but in April 1811 he joined Madison's administration as Secretary of State. [SEP] [CLS] During the later stages of the War of 1812, Monroe simultaneously served as Madison's Secretary of State and Secretary of War. [SEP] [CLS] His wartime leadership established him as Madison's heir apparent, and he easily defeated Federalist Party candidate Rufus King in the 1816 presidential election. [SEP] [CLS] Monroe's presidency was coterminous with the Era of Good Feelings, as the Federalist Party collapsed as a national political force. [SEP] [CLS] As president, Monroe signed the Missouri Compromise, which admitted Missouri as a slave state and banned slavery from territories north of the parallel 36°30′ north. [SEP] [CLS] In foreign affairs, Monroe and Secretary of State John Quincy Adams favored a policy of conciliation with Britain and a policy of expansionism against the Spanish Empire. [SEP] [CLS] In the 1819 Adams–Onís Treaty with Spain, the United States secured Florida and established its western border with New Spain. [SEP] [CLS] In 1823, Monroe announced the United States' opposition to any European intervention in the recently independent countries of the Americas with the Monroe Doctrine, which became a landmark in American foreign policy. [SEP] [CLS] Monroe was a member of the American Colonization Society, which supported the colonization of Africa by freed slaves, and Liberia's capital of Monrovia is named in his honor. [SEP] [CLS] Following his retirement in 1825, Monroe was plagued by financial difficulties, and died on July 4, 1831 in New York City. [SEP] [CLS] He has been generally ranked as an above-average president by historians. [SEP] [CLS]
