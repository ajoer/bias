[CLS] The New Year's Day Storm (Norwegian: Nyttårsorkanen) was a powerful European windstorm that affected much of northern Scotland and western Norway on 1 January 1992. [SEP] [CLS] DNMI estimated the strongest sustained winds (10 min. [SEP] [CLS] average) and the strongest gusts to have reached 90 knots (46 m/s) and 62 m/s, respectively. [SEP] [CLS] Unofficial records of gusts in excess of 130 knots (67 m/s) were recorded in Shetland, while Statfjord-B in the North Sea recorded wind gusts in excess of 145 knots (75 m/s). [SEP] [CLS] There were very few fatalities, mainly due to the rather low population of the islands, and the fact that the islanders are used to powerful wind, and because it struck in the morning on a public holiday when people were indoors. [SEP] [CLS] In Norway there was one fatality, in Frei, Møre og Romsdal county. [SEP] [CLS] There were also two fatalities on Unst in the Shetland Isles. [SEP] [CLS]
