Typhoon Bilis, known in the Philippines as Typhoon Isang, was the strongest tropical cyclone in the western Pacific during 2000 and wrought considerable damage in Taiwan and China in August of that year. [CLS] [SEP] The tenth named storm of the season, Bilis originated from an area of disturbed weather that developed into a tropical depression southeast of Guam on August 18. [CLS] [SEP] Situated within an environment highly conductive for continued tropical development, the depression intensified into a tropical storm a day after formation; Bilis was upgraded to typhoon status on August 20 as it maintained a northwest course. [CLS] [SEP] Without significant inhibiting factors, the typhoon reached peak intensity with maximum sustained winds of 205 km/h (125 mph) and a minimum barometric pressure of 920 mbar (hPa; 27.17 inHg). [CLS] [SEP] At the same intensity Bilis made landfall on Taiwan the following day. [CLS] [SEP] Despite its short stint over land, Bilis was greatly weakened, and made a brief track over the Taiwan Strait before its final landfall on China's Fujian Province early the next day. [CLS] [SEP] Moving inland into Mainland China, Bilis quickly weakened, and was only a tropical depression later that day; the depression diffused into a remnant low on August 25. [CLS] [SEP] These remnants tracked northeast across the Yellow Sea before dissipating in the Korean Peninsula on August 27. [CLS] [SEP]
