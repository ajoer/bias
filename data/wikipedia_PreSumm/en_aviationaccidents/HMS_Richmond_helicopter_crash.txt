[CLS] The Westland Lynx helicopter attached to the Royal Navy frigate HMS Richmond crashed into the Atlantic Ocean on 12 June 2002, killing two of the three on board. [SEP] [CLS] It had been returning to the ship after an air-to-ship missile live firing exercise, when it suffered a double engine failure. [SEP] [CLS] The two fatalities were Lieutenants Rod Skidmore and Jenny Lewis, the pilot and observer seated in the two-person cockpit; Lewis is believed to be the first female Royal Navy pilot or observer to die in service. [SEP] [CLS] A third crew member, Petty Officer Paul Hanson, survived after being rescued. [SEP] [CLS] He had been on board to record the exercise. [SEP] [CLS] The helicopter went down approximately 200 miles off the eastern seaboard of the United States, necessitating the deepest salvage operation ever undertaken by the Ministry of Defence. [SEP] [CLS] Both the wreckage and the body of Skidmore were recovered, but Lewis's body was never found, leading the coroner to express regret that he was only permitted in law to record a verdict on Skidmore, of accidental death.
