The 1906 Aleutian Islands earthquake occurred at 00:11 UTC on August 17. [CLS] [SEP] It had an estimated seismic moment of 3.8 x 1028 dyn cm−1, equivalent to a magnitude of 8.35 on the moment magnitude scale. [CLS] [SEP] This earthquake was followed thirty minutes later by the 1906 Valparaíso earthquake in Chile, but the two events are not thought to be linked. [CLS] [SEP] Due to the remote location, there are no reports of damage associated with this earthquake. [CLS] [SEP] A transpacific tsunami reported from Japan and Hawaii was triggered by the Chilean event, rather than the Aleutian Islands earthquake. [CLS] [SEP]
