[CLS] The 1953 North Sea flood was a major flood caused by a heavy storm that occurred on the night of Saturday, 31 January 1953 and morning of Sunday, 1 February 1953. [SEP] [CLS] The floods struck the Netherlands, Belgium and the United Kingdom. [SEP] [CLS] A combination of a high spring tide and a severe European windstorm over the North Sea caused a storm tide; the combination of wind, high tide, and low pressure led to a water level of more than 5.6 metres (18.4 ft) above mean sea level in some locations. [SEP] [CLS] The flood and waves overwhelmed sea defences and caused extensive flooding. [SEP] [CLS] The Netherlands, a country with 20% of its territory below mean sea level and 50% less than 1 metre (3.3 ft) above sea level and which relies heavily on sea defences, was worst affected, recording 1,836 deaths and widespread property damage. [SEP] [CLS] Most of the casualties occurred in the southern province of Zeeland. [SEP] [CLS] In England, 307 people were killed in the counties of Lincolnshire, Norfolk, Suffolk and Essex. [SEP] [CLS] Nineteen were killed in Scotland. [SEP] [CLS] Twenty-eight people were killed in West Flanders, Belgium. [SEP] [CLS] In addition, more than 230 deaths occurred on water craft along Northern European coasts as well as on ships in deeper waters of the North Sea. [SEP] [CLS] The ferry MV Princess Victoria was lost at sea in the North Channel east of Belfast with 133 fatalities, and many fishing trawlers sank. [SEP] [CLS] Realising that such infrequent events could reoccur, the Netherlands and the United Kingdom carried out major studies on strengthening of coastal defences. [SEP] [CLS] The Netherlands developed the Delta Works, an extensive system of dams and storm surge barriers. [SEP] [CLS] The UK constructed storm surge barriers on the River Thames below London and on the River Hull where it meets the Humber Estuary. [SEP] [CLS]
