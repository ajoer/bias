[CLS] Hurricane Hilda was a intense tropical cyclone that ravaged areas of the United States Gulf Coast, particularly Louisiana. [SEP] [CLS] In addition to its damage inland, the hurricane greatly disrupted offshore oil production, and at its time was the costliest tropical cyclone for Louisiana's offshore oil production. [SEP] [CLS] Due in part to flights made by the National Hurricane Research Laboratory, Hilda became one of the most well-documented storms meteorologically in the Atlantic. [SEP] [CLS] Lasting for seven days as a tropical cyclone, Hilda caused US$126 million in damage and 38 deaths. [SEP] [CLS] It was the tenth named storm, sixth hurricane, and the fourth major hurricane of the 1964 Atlantic hurricane season. [SEP] [CLS] Hilda developed over the southern shores of Cuba on September 28 as a tropical depression, tracking westward in an area of favorable conditions and reaching tropical storm intensity the next day. [SEP] [CLS] Once situated in the Gulf of Mexico, Hilda strengthened into a hurricane and began a slow trawl northward, rapidly intensifying to its peak intensity with winds of 140 mph (240 km/h) on October 1, making it a Category 4 hurricane equivalent. [SEP] [CLS] Slight weakening occurred as Hilda made landfall on the southern Louisiana coast on October 3. [SEP] [CLS] After reaching land, the hurricane took a sharp turn eastward and rapidly weakened as a result of land interaction and the presence of cool, dry air. [SEP] [CLS] The weakened remnants of Hilda merged with a cold front a day after landfall and dissipated on October 5. [SEP] [CLS] Originating near Cuba, the cyclone intensified while moving through the Gulf of Mexico, and became a Category 4 hurricane in the Gulf of Mexico before striking Louisiana in early October. [SEP] [CLS] In combination with a frontal zone located across the Southeast United States, the hurricane spread heavy rains through the South through the Carolinas into the Mid-Atlantic States. [SEP] [CLS] Hilda led to significant damage to oil platforms in the Gulf of Mexico, as well as $126 million (1964 USD) in damage, and 38 deaths. [SEP] [CLS]
