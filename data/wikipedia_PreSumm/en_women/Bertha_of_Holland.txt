[CLS] Bertha of Holland (c. [SEP] [CLS] 1055 â€“ 15 October 1094), also known as Berthe or Bertha of Frisia and erroneously as Berta or Bertrada, was queen of France from 1072 until 1092, as the first wife of King Philip I of France. [SEP] [CLS] Bertha's marriage to the king in 1072 was a result of peace negotiations between him and her stepfather, Count Robert I of Flanders. [SEP] [CLS] After nine years of childlessness, the royal couple had three children, including Philip's successor, Louis VI. [SEP] [CLS] Philip, however, grew tired of his wife by 1090, and repudiated her in 1092 in order to marry the already married Bertrade of Montfort. [SEP] [CLS] That marriage was a scandal since both Philip and Bertrade were already married to other people, at least until Queen Bertha died the next year. [SEP] [CLS]
