[SEP] [CLS] He later served as Chief of Staff of the U.S. [SEP] [CLS] Air Force from 1961 to 1965. [SEP] [CLS] LeMay joined the U.S. [SEP] [CLS] Army Air Corps, the precursor to the U.S. [SEP] [CLS] Air Force, in 1929 while studying civil engineering at Ohio State University. [SEP] [CLS] He had risen to the rank of major by the time of Japan's Attack on Pearl Harbor in December 1941 and the United States's subsequent entry into World War II. [SEP] [CLS] He commanded the 305th Operations Group from October 1942 until September 1943, and the 3rd Air Division in the European theatre of World War II until August 1944, when he was transferred to the China Burma India Theater. [SEP] [CLS] He was then placed in command of strategic bombing operations against Japan, planning and executing a massive fire bombing campaign against Japanese cities and Operation Starvation, a crippling minelaying campaign in Japan's internal waterways. [SEP] [CLS] After the war, he was assigned to command USAF Europe and coordinated the Berlin airlift.

[SEP] [CLS] The ticket won 13.5% of the popular vote, a strong tally for a third party campaign, but the Wallace campaign came to see LeMay as a liability.
