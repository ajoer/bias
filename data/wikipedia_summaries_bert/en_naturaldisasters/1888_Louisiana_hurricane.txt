The 1888 Louisiana hurricane was a major hurricane that caused significant flooding and wind damage to the Mississippi River Delta and the Mississippi Valley in late August 1888. [CLS] [SEP] It was the third tropical cyclone and second hurricane of the 1888 Atlantic hurricane season. [CLS] [SEP] The cyclone first appeared north-northeast of the Turks and Caicos Islands, but may have formed earlier, undetected. [CLS] [SEP] It moved west-northwest, reaching hurricane intensity and making several landfalls in the Bahamas. [CLS] [SEP] In the island chain, the hurricane caused some damage to shipping, fruit groves, and fences, but apparently caused no known deaths. [CLS] [SEP] The storm then peaked as the equivalence of a strong Category 3 hurricane before hitting South Florida near present-day Miami Beach. [CLS] [SEP] Few people then lived in the area, so damage was mostly minimal, but a large storm surge affected the coast, and areas farther north on the peninsula reported damage to fruit groves, communications wires, and boats. [CLS] [SEP] Afterward, the cyclone crossed the thinly populated southern peninsula into the Gulf of Mexico, which it reached as a weaker hurricane. [CLS] [SEP] Re-intensifying over the Gulf of Mexico, the hurricane attained a secondary peak intensity of 110 miles per hour (177 km/h) before hitting Louisiana at that intensity. [CLS] [SEP] Areas along the Gulf Coast reported significant, widespread destruction from heavy rains, storm surge, and high tides, especially in Louisiana, where the storm destroyed crops and blew down buildings. [CLS] [SEP] The storm then curved northeast into New England before transitioning into an extratropical low-pressure area. [CLS] [SEP] The outer bands of the storm produced gale-force winds in the region and nearby Mid-Atlantic states, downing loose objects such as tree branches, awnings, and wires. [CLS] [SEP] Heavy rains washed out transportation networks like roads and railroads, but the worst effects were from a tornado outbreak; several significant tornadoes hit the Mid-Atlantic region, one of which caused 10 of the 12 reported deaths in the outbreak.
