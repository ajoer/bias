[CLS] The Keanakakoi eruption was a VEI-4 eruption that occurred from the summit caldera of Kīlauea volcano in or around November 1790. [SEP] [CLS] It has been described as the deadliest volcanic eruption in what is now the United States, with more than 400 people having been killed in the event. [SEP] [CLS] The eruption deposited the Keanakakoi Ash which surrounds the Kīlauea Caldera.Three eruptive phases define the Keanakakoi eruption, all of which were separated by quiescent spells. [SEP] [CLS] The first phase was phreatomagmatic, and involved the deposition of fine-grained, well-bedded volcanic ash. [SEP] [CLS] A Strombolian-style scoria fall deposit and phreatomagmatic ash similar to that of the first phase were deposited during the second phase. [SEP] [CLS] The third and final phase was phreatic and produced interbedded fallout and surge deposits. [SEP] [CLS]
