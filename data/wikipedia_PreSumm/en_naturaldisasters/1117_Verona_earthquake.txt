[CLS] An earthquake, rated at VII (Very strong) on the Mercalli intensity scale, struck northern Italy and Germany on 3 January 1117. [SEP] [CLS] The epicentre of the first shock was near Verona, the city which suffered the most damage. [SEP] [CLS] The outer wall of the amphitheatre was partially felled, and the standing portion was damaged in a later earthquake of 1183. [SEP] [CLS] Many other churches, monasteries, and ancient monuments were destroyed or seriously damaged, eliminating much of Verona's early medieval architecture and providing space for a massive Romanesque rebuilding. [SEP] [CLS] After the first shock of 3 January, seismic activity persisted for months, striking on 12 January, 4 June, 1 July, 1 October, and 30 December. [SEP] [CLS] The earthquake was not only felt in Verona but across northern Italy, from Cividale to Pavia, south to Pisa and north to Switzerland. [SEP] [CLS] Outside of Verona the most damaged areas were Milan, Bergamo, Brescia, Venice, Treviso, Modena, Parma, and Cremona. [SEP] [CLS] The main churches of Padua all suffered major damage. [SEP] [CLS] News of the earthquake reached Montecassino and Reims. [SEP] [CLS] The Milanese chronicler Landolfo Iuniore reported that the church synods needed to be carried out in the open air, due to the destruction. [SEP] [CLS] In Germany, damage was also extensive. [SEP] [CLS] The Michaelskirche in Bamberg, the abbey at Brauweiler, and buildings in Rottenburg am Neckar, Constance, Meersburg, and FÃ©nis were all reported damaged.Recent studies, however, suggest that it was not a major, single event on 3 January, but instead a series of shocks in the areas of Verona (west Veneto) and Cremona (Lower Lombardy), which happened in a few days or even in a few hours. [SEP] [CLS] Other earthquakes may have hit as far south as Pisa (northwest Tuscany) and as north as Augsburg (southwest Bavaria), as distinct events, in the same days. [SEP] [CLS]
