[CLS] Cyclone Alibera was the second longest-lasting tropical cyclone on record in the south-west Indian Ocean, with a duration of 22 days. [SEP] [CLS] It formed on December 16, 1989, well to the northeast of Madagascar. [SEP] [CLS] For several days, it meandered southwestward while gradually intensifying. [SEP] [CLS] On December 20, Alibera intensified to tropical cyclone status with 10‑minute maximum sustained winds of 120 km/h (75 mph), or the equivalent of a minimal hurricane. [SEP] [CLS] That day, the Météo-France office in Réunion (MFR) estimated 10‑minute winds of 140 km/h (85 mph), while the Joint Typhoon Warning Center (JTWC), an unofficial warning agency for the region, estimated peak 1‑minute winds of 250 km/h (150 mph). [SEP] [CLS] After drifting erratically for several days, the storm began a steady southwest motion on December 29 as a greatly weakened system. [SEP] [CLS] On January 1, Alibera struck southeastern Madagascar near Mananjary, having re-intensified to just below tropical cyclone status. [SEP] [CLS] It weakened over land but again restrengthened upon reaching open waters on January 3. [SEP] [CLS] The storm turned to the southeast, then to the southwest, and finally back to the southeast, dissipating on January 5. [SEP] [CLS] Early in its duration, Alibera produced gusty winds in the Seychelles. [SEP] [CLS] Upon moving ashore in Madagascar, the cyclone lashed coastal cities with heavy rainfall and up to 250-km/h (150-mph) wind gusts. [SEP] [CLS] In Mananjary, nearly every building was damaged or destroyed, and locals considered it the worst storm since 1925. [SEP] [CLS] Across the region, the cyclone destroyed large areas of crops, thousands of houses, and several roads and bridges. [SEP] [CLS] Alibera killed 46 people and left 55,346 people homeless. [SEP] [CLS] After the storm, the Malagasy government requested for international assistance. [SEP] [CLS]
