Ronald Wilson Reagan (; February 6, 1911 – June 5, 2004) was an American politician who served as the 40th president of the United States from 1981 to 1989 and became a highly influential voice of modern conservatism. [CLS] [SEP] Prior to his presidency, he was a Hollywood actor and union leader before serving as the 33rd governor of California from 1967 to 1975. [CLS] [SEP] Reagan was raised in a low-income family in small towns of northern Illinois. [CLS] [SEP] He graduated from Eureka College in 1932 and worked as a radio sports commentator. [CLS] [SEP] After moving to California in 1937, he found work as an actor and starred in a few major productions. [CLS] [SEP] As president of the Screen Actors Guild, Reagan worked to root out communist influence. [CLS] [SEP] In the 1950s, he moved into television and was a motivational speaker at General Electric factories. [CLS] [SEP] In 1964, his speech "A Time for Choosing" earned him national attention as a new conservative spokesman. [CLS] [SEP] Building a network of supporters, Reagan was elected governor of California in 1966. [CLS] [SEP] As governor, he raised taxes, turned a state budget deficit to a surplus, challenged the protesters at UC Berkeley, and ordered in National Guard troops during a period of protest movements. [CLS] [SEP] In 1980, Reagan won the Republican presidential nomination and defeated the incumbent president, Jimmy Carter. [CLS] [SEP] At 69 years, 349 days of age at the time of his first inauguration, Reagan was the oldest person to assume the U.S. [CLS] [SEP] presidency, a distinction he held until 2017, when Donald Trump was inaugurated at age 70 years, 220 days. [CLS] [SEP] Reagan faced former vice president Walter Mondale when he ran for re-election in 1984 and defeated him, winning the most electoral votes of any U.S. [CLS] [SEP] president, 525, or 97.6% of the 538 votes in the Electoral College. [CLS] [SEP] It was the second-most lopsided presidential election in modern U.S. [CLS] [SEP] history after Franklin D. [CLS] [SEP] Roosevelt's 1936 victory over Alfred M. [CLS] [SEP] Landon, in which he won 98.5%, or 523, of the (then-total) 531 electoral votes.Immediately on taking office as president, Reagan began implementing sweeping new political and economic initiatives that were highly popular among conservatives but denounced by liberals. [CLS] [SEP] Reagan won over enough conservative Democrats to pass his program through Congress. [CLS] [SEP] Economic conditions had deteriorated under Carter, with slow growth and high inflation. [CLS] [SEP] Reagan promised that his supply-side economic policies, dubbed "Reaganomics", would turn around the economy with lower tax rates, economic deregulation, and reduction in government spending. [CLS] [SEP] However conditions remained harsh until they finally turned as promised in time for his reelection in 1984. [CLS] [SEP] Over his two terms, the economy saw a reduction of inflation from 12.5% to 4.4% and an average real GDP annual growth of 3.6%. [CLS] [SEP] Reagan enacted cuts in domestic discretionary spending, cut taxes, and increased military spending, which contributed to increased federal debt overall. [CLS] [SEP] In his first term, he survived an assassination attempt, spurred the War on Drugs, and fought public sector labor unions. [CLS] [SEP] In foreign affairs he denounced Communism and invaded the island country of Grenada after far-left elements took control. [CLS] [SEP] It represented a rollback of Communism that astonished the world. [CLS] [SEP] With the economy booming again, foreign affair crises dominated his second term. [CLS] [SEP] Major concerns were the bombing of Libya, the Iran–Iraq War, the Iran–Contra affair, and the renewed Cold War. [CLS] [SEP] In June 1987, four years after he publicly described the Soviet Union as an "evil empire", Reagan challenged Soviet leader Mikhail Gorbachev to "tear down this wall!", during a speech at the Berlin Wall. [CLS] [SEP] He transitioned Cold War policy from détente to rollback by escalating an arms race with the USSR. [CLS] [SEP] He then engaged in talks with Gorbachev that culminated in the INF Treaty, which shrank both countries' nuclear arsenals. [CLS] [SEP] Reagan began his presidency during the decline of the Soviet Union. [CLS] [SEP] The Cold War ended in October 1989 and Soviet communism suddenly collapsed in 1991. [CLS] [SEP] When Reagan left office in January 1989, he held an approval rating of 68%, matching those of Franklin D. [CLS] [SEP] Roosevelt, and later Bill Clinton, as the highest ratings for departing presidents in the modern era. [CLS] [SEP] He was the first president since Dwight D. [CLS] [SEP] Eisenhower to serve two full terms, after the five prior presidents did not. [CLS] [SEP] Although he had planned an active post-presidency, Reagan disclosed in November 1994 that he had been diagnosed with Alzheimer's disease earlier that year. [CLS] [SEP] Afterward, his informal public appearances became more infrequent as the disease progressed. [CLS] [SEP] He died at home on June 5, 2004. [CLS] [SEP] His tenure constituted a realignment toward conservative policies in the United States, and he is an icon among conservatives. [CLS] [SEP] Evaluations of his presidency among historians and the general public place him among the upper tier of American presidents. [CLS] [SEP]
