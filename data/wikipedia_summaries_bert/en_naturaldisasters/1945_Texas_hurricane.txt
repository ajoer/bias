The 1945 Texas hurricane was a slow-moving tropical cyclone which paralleled the Texas Gulf Coast, causing extensive damage in late-August 1945. [CLS] [SEP] The fifth tropical storm and second hurricane of the annual hurricane season, the storm formed out of an area of disturbed weather which had been situated over the Bay of Campeche on August 24. [CLS] [SEP] In favorable conditions, the system quickly intensified as it steadily moved northward, attaining hurricane intensity later that day. [CLS] [SEP] As it approached the coast, however, the hurricane quickly slowed in forward motion, allowing it time to intensify off the Texas coast. [CLS] [SEP] After reaching major hurricane status, the storm reached peak intensity on August 26 as a minimal Category 3 hurricane with maximum sustained winds of 115 miles per hour (185 km/h). [CLS] [SEP] Later that day, the cyclone executed a slight curve toward the Texas coast, and early the next day made landfall near Seadrift at peak intensity. [CLS] [SEP] Once inland, it quickly weakened, and degenerated into a remnant low on August 29 over Central Texas. [CLS] [SEP] The hurricane's slow movement and strong intensity was a catalyst for extensive and damaging impacts in Texas. [CLS] [SEP] Prior to making landfall, thousands of people were ordered to evacuate from cities along coastal regions. [CLS] [SEP] Upon making landfall, the storm brought strong winds, which caused widespread power outages and infrastructural damage. [CLS] [SEP] A peak gust of 135 mph (215 km/h) measured in Collegeport, Texas. [CLS] [SEP] Northeast of Houston, Texas, a tornado killed a person after traveling for 22 mi (35 km). [CLS] [SEP] At the coast, the hurricane produced a strong storm surge which swept and damaged port cities. [CLS] [SEP] Port Lavaca, Texas was inundated by a 15 ft (4.6 m) storm surge, which at the time was the third highest ever recorded in the state. [CLS] [SEP] Damage in the port alone was estimated to be as high as $1 million. [CLS] [SEP] The strong wave action killed two people when it capsized a fishing vessel. [CLS] [SEP] Further inland, the storm produced torrential rainfall, which was also aided by the hurricane's slow movement. [CLS] [SEP] Rainfall peaked at 19.6 in (500 mm) in Hockley, Texas. [CLS] [SEP] The heavy rains caused extensive crop damage, particularly to cotton and rice crops. [CLS] [SEP] Damage to cotton in the Corpus Christi, Texas area alone was estimated at $1.5 million. [CLS] [SEP] Overall, the hurricane caused $20.1 million in damage, mostly to crops, and three deaths. [CLS] [SEP]
