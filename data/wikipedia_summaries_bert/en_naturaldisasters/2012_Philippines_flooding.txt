The 2012 Luzon southwest monsoon floods (informally known in Tagalog as Hagupít ng Habagat, "wrath of the monsoon" and Bagsík ng Habagat, "fierceness of the monsoon", from habagat, the Filipino term for the southwest monsoon), was an eight-day period of torrential rain and thunderstorms in Luzon in the Philippines from August 1 to August 8, 2012. [CLS] [SEP] Its effects centered on Metro Manila, the surrounding provinces of the Calabarzon region (Quezon, Cavite, Laguna and Rizal) and the provinces of Central Luzon (Bulacan, Pampanga and Bataan). [CLS] [SEP] Not a typhoon in its own right, the storm was a strong movement of the southwest monsoon (Tagalog: Habagat) caused by the pull of Typhoon Saola (Gener) from August 1–3, strengthened by Typhoon Haikui. [CLS] [SEP] It caused typhoon-like damage: the most damage caused by rain since September 2009, when Typhoon Ketsana (Ondoy) struck Metro Manila. [CLS] [SEP] The heavy rain caused the Marikina River to overflow, destroying areas also affected by Ketsana, triggering a landslide in the Commonwealth area and collapsing the northbound Marcos Highway. [CLS] [SEP] Its damage was nearly as severe as Ketsana's, although the storm did not reach typhoon intensity when the rain reached its peak on August 7. [CLS] [SEP] The floods and rain left 95 people dead, 8,428 homes destroyed and 6,706 damaged. [CLS] [SEP] Nationwide losses totaled at least ₱604.63 million (US$14.31 million). [CLS] [SEP]
