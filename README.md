# Bias

Data and code for bias and fairness evaluation of encoders.

So far this repo only contains the code for extracting summaries of pages on Wikipedia (films, restaurants and speeches), the extracted summaries and the initial list of pages.
Later this will also include the analysis and visualization code as well as resources and other data sources used in the project. 

The list of films is cut off at 5000.
The lists of films, restaurants and speeches is extracted from Wikidata and are language dependent (except for restaurants, which are named entities and presumed language independent).
