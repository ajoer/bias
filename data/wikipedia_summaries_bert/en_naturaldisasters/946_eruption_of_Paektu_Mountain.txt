The 946 eruption of Paektu Mountain in Korea and China, also known as the Millennium Eruption or Tianchi eruption, was one of the most powerful volcanic eruptions in recorded history and is classified as a VEI 7 event. [CLS] [SEP] The eruption resulted in a brief period of significant climate change in Manchuria. [CLS] [SEP] The year of the eruption has not been precisely determined, but a possible year is A.D. [CLS] [SEP] 946.The eruption ejected about 100–120 cubic kilometers (24–29 cu mi) of tephra and collapsed the mountain into a caldera, which now contains the crater lake Heaven Lake. [CLS] [SEP] The eruption began with a strong Plinian column, and ended with voluminous pyroclastic flows. [CLS] [SEP] An average of 5 cm (2.0 in) of Plinian ashfall and coignimbrite ashfall covered about 1,500,000 km2 (580,000 sq mi) of the Sea of Japan and northern Japan. [CLS] [SEP] This ash layer has been named the "Baegdusan-Tomakomai ash"(B-Tm). [CLS] [SEP] It probably occurred in winter in late A.D. [CLS] [SEP] 946. [CLS] [SEP] This was one of the largest and most violent eruptions in the last 5000 years, along with the Hatepe eruption of Lake Taupo (around 180 AD), the 1257 eruption of Mount Samalas near Mount Rinjani, and the 1815 eruption of Mount Tambora.
