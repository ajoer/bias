[SEP] [CLS] After reaching hurricane status on October 21, Neki intensified at a much faster rate and peaked with winds of 125 mph (205 km/h). [SEP] [CLS] It later turned to the north and north-northeast and weakened due to hostile conditions. [SEP] [CLS] While passing through the Papahānaumokuākea Marine National Monument, Neki was downgraded to a tropical storm after the center became exposed from the deepest convection. [SEP] [CLS] It caused little impact in the island chain. [SEP] [CLS] After stalling and executing a small loop, Neki resumed its northward track and dissipated on October 27. [SEP] [CLS]
