[CLS] In 2002, two large airtankers – a Lockheed C-130 Hercules and a Consolidated PB4Y-2 Privateer – crashed about a month apart while performing aerial firefighting operations. [SEP] [CLS] These crashes prompted a review of the maintenance and use of the entire U.S. [SEP] [CLS] large airtanker fleet. [SEP] [CLS] Ultimately, the whole fleet (33 aircraft in all) was grounded, dramatically reducing the resources available to fight major wildfires. [SEP] [CLS] Both aircraft were owned by Hawkins & Powers Aviation of Greybull, Wyoming and operated under contract to the United States Forest Service (USFS). [SEP] [CLS] The crashes occurred in one of the worst fire seasons in the last half century, one in which 73,000 fires burned 7.2 million acres (29,000 km2) of land. [SEP] [CLS]
