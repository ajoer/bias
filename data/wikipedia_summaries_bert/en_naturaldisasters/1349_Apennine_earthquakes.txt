[SEP] [CLS] Four moderate-large earthquakes devastated towns and villages across the central Italian peninsula, with damage even reported in Rome. [SEP] [CLS] These earthquakes originated from the Apennine fold and thrust belt fault network, with the first and most destructive shock's epicenter originating from the north-west Campania region. [SEP] [CLS] Paleoseimological data gathered from scarping, fault length, and collapsed sections of Venafro's Roman aqueduct indicates the epicenter of the main shock was likely along the Aquae Iuliae fault. [SEP] [CLS] The fault suspected of causing this earthquake occurred on the Aqua Iuliae fault along the Molise-Campania border. [SEP] [CLS]
