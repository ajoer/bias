[CLS] [SEP] After the initial shocks, a sequence of aftershocks continued for four years, with over 2000 in the period from November 1570 to February 1571.The same area was struck, centuries later, by another major earthquake of comparable intensity. [CLS] [SEP] The disaster destroyed half the city, permanently marked many of the buildings left standing, and directly contributed to – but was not the sole cause of – a long-term decline of the city lasting until the 19th century. [CLS] [SEP] The earthquake caused the first documented episode of soil liquefaction in the Po Valley, and one of the oldest occurrences of the event known outside of paleoseismology.
