Mahieu de Gant (fl. [CLS] [SEP] mid–late 13th century) was a Flemish trouvère (composer) from Ghent associated with the so-called "school of Arras". [CLS] [SEP] He has been conflated with Mahieu le Juif, but the same manuscript containing both their works clearly distinguishes them. [CLS] [SEP] His career can only be dated because of those with whom he composed jeux partis, which includes Robert de la Piere, who died in 1258. [CLS] [SEP] All of Mahieu's melodies are in bar form.
