Tropical Storm Trudy was a short-lived tropical cyclone in October 2014 that caused significant flooding in southern Mexico. [CLS] [SEP] The storm originated from an area of low pressure associated with a monsoon trough near Central America in early October. [CLS] [SEP] A slow-moving system, the low eventually consolidated into a tropical depression on October 17 near the Mexican coastline. [CLS] [SEP] Favorable environmental conditions aided rapid development of Trudy. [CLS] [SEP] Within 15 hours of its designation, an eye formed over the storm's center. [CLS] [SEP] Trudy ultimately achieved its peak as a strong tropical storm with 65 mph (100 km/h) winds as it made landfall just southeast of Marquelia, Mexico. [CLS] [SEP] The region's mountainous terrain quickly weakened Trudy and the cyclone dissipated early on October 19. [CLS] [SEP] Though the cyclone dissipated, its remnant energy later contributed to the formation of Tropical Storm Hanna in the Atlantic. [CLS] [SEP] Prior to Trudy's landfall, the Government of Mexico issued multiple watches and warnings for the threatened region. [CLS] [SEP] Forecasters highlighted the threat of heavy rains and mudslides. [CLS] [SEP] Guerrero experienced the greatest effects from Trudy, with landslides and flooding claiming eight lives in the state. [CLS] [SEP] Over 4,000 people were evacuated in the region. [CLS] [SEP] A ninth fatality took place in Campeche. [CLS] [SEP]
