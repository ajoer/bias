[CLS] [SEP] He came to prominence through his tenures as Mayor of Dalian and then the governor of Liaoning. [CLS] [SEP] From 2004 to November 2007, he served as Minister of Commerce. [CLS] [SEP] Between 2007 and 2012, he served as a member of the Politburo and Communist Party Secretary of Chongqing, a major interior municipality. [CLS] [SEP] He is the son of Bo Yibo, one of the Eight Elders of the Communist Party of China, and one of the "princelings" of Chinese politics. [CLS] [SEP] He cultivated a casual and charismatic image in a marked departure from Chinese political convention. [CLS] [SEP] In Chongqing, Bo initiated a campaign against organized crime, increased spending on welfare programs, maintained consistent double-digit percentage GDP growth, and campaigned to revive Cultural Revolution-era "red culture". [CLS] [SEP] Bo's promotion of egalitarian values and the achievements of his "Chongqing model" made him the champion of the Chinese New Left, composed of both Maoists and social democrats disillusioned with the country's market-based economic reforms and increasing economic inequality. [CLS] [SEP] However, the perceived lawlessness of Bo's anti-corruption campaigns, coupled with concerns about the image he cultivated, made him a controversial figure. [CLS] [SEP] Bo was considered a likely candidate for promotion to the elite Politburo Standing Committee in 18th Party Congress in 2012. [CLS] [SEP] His political fortunes came to an abrupt end following the Wang Lijun incident, in which his top lieutenant and police chief sought asylum at the American consulate in Chengdu. [CLS] [SEP] Wang claimed to have information about the involvement of Bo Xilai and his wife Gu Kailai in the murder of British businessman Neil Heywood, who allegedly had close financial ties to the two. [CLS] [SEP] In the fallout, Bo was removed as the party chief of Chongqing and lost his seat on the Politburo. [CLS] [SEP] He was later stripped of all his positions and lost his seat at the National People's Congress and eventually expelled from the party. [CLS] [SEP] In 2013, Bo was found guilty of corruption, stripped of all his assets and sentenced to life imprisonment. [CLS] [SEP] He is incarcerated at Qincheng Prison. [CLS] [SEP]
