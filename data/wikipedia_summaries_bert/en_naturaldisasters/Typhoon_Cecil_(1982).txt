Typhoon Cecil, known in the Philippines as Typhoon Loleng, was a mid-season tropical cyclone that affected Japan and South Korea during August 1982. [CLS] [SEP] An area of disturbed weather formed to the north of Truk on July 31 and tracked westward over the next several days. [CLS] [SEP] Following an increase in shower activity and a decrease in wind shear, a tropical depression developed on August 4. [CLS] [SEP] Two days later, the depression strengthened into a tropical storm. [CLS] [SEP] After turning northwestward and then northward, Cecil intensified into a typhoon on August 7, and then began to deepen at a rapid clip. [CLS] [SEP] On August 8, Cecil attained its maximum intensity as it brushed Taiwan. [CLS] [SEP] There, 19 people were killed, including 4 in Wugu District, where 2,800 families sought shelter. [CLS] [SEP] After pulling away from Taiwan, Typhoon Cecil moved northwestward, and then on August 10, turned to the north-northeast. [CLS] [SEP] Colder air, cooler waters, and higher shear contributed to a weakening trend, and Cecil was downgraded to a tropical storm on August 11. [CLS] [SEP] Although Cecil passed east of Japan, it came close enough to the country to drop heavy rains. [CLS] [SEP] Nation-wide, three people were killed and two were injured.
