Hurricane Mitch is the second-deadliest Atlantic hurricane on record, causing over 11,000 fatalities in Central America in 1998, including approximately 7,000 in Honduras and 3,800 in Nicaragua due to catastrophic flooding from the slow motion of the storm. [CLS] [SEP] It was the deadliest hurricane in Central American history, surpassing Hurricane Fifi–Orlene, which killed slightly fewer people there in 1974. [CLS] [SEP] The thirteenth named storm, ninth hurricane, and third major hurricane of the 1998 Atlantic hurricane season, Mitch formed in the western Caribbean Sea on October 22, and after drifting through extremely favorable conditions, it rapidly strengthened to peak at Category 5 status, the highest possible rating on the Saffir–Simpson Hurricane Scale. [CLS] [SEP] After drifting southwestward and weakening, the hurricane hit Honduras as a minimal hurricane. [CLS] [SEP] Mitch drifted through Central America, regenerated in the Bay of Campeche, and ultimately struck Florida as a strong tropical storm. [CLS] [SEP] It then became extratropical and accelerated northeastward across the North Atlantic, before dissipating on November 9. [CLS] [SEP] At the time, Mitch was the strongest Atlantic hurricane observed in the month of October, though it has since been surpassed by Hurricane Wilma of the 2005 season. [CLS] [SEP] In addition, Mitch is the eighth-most intense Atlantic hurricane on record. [CLS] [SEP] Being "the deadliest Atlantic hurricane" in over 200 years, Mitch caused catastrophic impacts across its path, but the most disastrous impacts came from Honduras, which suffered over half of the total deaths. [CLS] [SEP] The President of Honduras estimated that Mitch set back 50 years of economic development. [CLS] [SEP] The storm wrecked about 35,000 houses and damaged another 50,000, leaving up to 1.5 million people homeless, or about 20 percent of the country's population. [CLS] [SEP] Mitch directly caused $2.005 billion in damage, with an additional $1.8 billion in indirect costs. [CLS] [SEP] Most of the damage was ruined crops, and cash crop exports were cut by 9.4 percent in 1999, largely due to the storm. [CLS] [SEP] Over 70 percent of the transportation infrastructure was damaged, mostly damaged highways and bridges. [CLS] [SEP] Widespread areas experienced power outages, and about 70 percent of the country lost water after the storm. [CLS] [SEP] In the capital, Tegucigalpa, a large landslide affected three neighborhoods and formed a temporary dam. [CLS] [SEP] Floods in the city damaged buildings that were over 350 years old. [CLS] [SEP] Throughout the country, there were at least 7,000 fatalities, some reported in each department. [CLS] [SEP] Following the storm, officials in Honduras requested international assistance, which totaled $2.8 billion over a several year period. [CLS] [SEP] Despite this, the gross domestic product began decreasing at the end of 1998, and contracted by 1.9 percent in 1999. [CLS] [SEP] Officials enacted a widespread curfew following the storm, and for 15 days temporarily restricted constitutional rights to maintain order. [CLS] [SEP] There were outbreaks of various diseases, and many residents faced food and water shortages. [CLS] [SEP] Due to the slow motion from October 29 to November 3, Hurricane Mitch dropped historic amounts of rainfall in Honduras, Guatemala, and Nicaragua, with unofficial reports of up to 75 inches (1,900 mm). [CLS] [SEP] Deaths due to catastrophic flooding made it the second deadliest Atlantic hurricane in history after the Great Hurricane of 1780; at least 11,374 people were confirmed to have been killed with over 11,000 left missing by the end of 1998; the true death toll may never be known. [CLS] [SEP] Additionally, roughly 2.7 million were left homeless as a result of the hurricane. [CLS] [SEP] Total damages caused by the hurricane were estimated to be around $6 billion (1998 USD). [CLS] [SEP] The name "Mitch" was retired, and will not be used for another Atlantic tropical cyclone. [CLS] [SEP]
