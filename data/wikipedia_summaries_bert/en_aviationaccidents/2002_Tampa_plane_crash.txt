[CLS] On January 5, 2002, Charles J. [SEP] [CLS] Bishop, a high-school student of East Lake High School in Tarpon Springs, Florida, United States, stole a Cessna 172 light aircraft and crashed it into the side of the Bank of America Tower in downtown Tampa, Florida. [SEP] [CLS] The impact killed the teenager and damaged an office room, but there were no other injuries. [SEP] [CLS] Bishop had been inspired by the September 11 attacks; he had left a suicide note crediting Osama bin Laden for the attacks and praising it as a justified response to actions against the Palestinians and Iraqis and said he (Bishop) was acting on behalf of Al Qaeda, from whom he had turned down help. [SEP] [CLS] As officials could find no other evidence of any connections, terrorism as a motive was ruled out, and they suggested that the crash was an apparent suicide. [SEP] [CLS] Bishop's mother filed, then dropped, a lawsuit claiming that psychological side effects from isotretinoin, an acne medicine Bishop took, which can include depression and rarely suicidal actions, caused the incident.
