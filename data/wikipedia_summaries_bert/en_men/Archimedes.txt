Archimedes of Syracuse (; Ancient Greek: Ἀρχιμήδης, Arkhimḗdēs; Doric Greek: [ar.kʰi.mɛː.dɛ̂ːs]; c. [CLS] [SEP] 287 – c. [CLS] [SEP] 212 BC) was a Greek mathematician, physicist, engineer, inventor, and astronomer. [CLS] [SEP] Although few details of his life are known, he is regarded as one of the leading scientists in classical antiquity. [CLS] [SEP] Considered to be the greatest mathematician of ancient history, and one of the greatest of all time, Archimedes anticipated modern calculus and analysis by applying concepts of infinitesimals and the method of exhaustion to derive and rigorously prove a range of geometrical theorems, including: the area of a circle; the surface area and volume of a sphere; area of an ellipse; the area under a parabola; the volume of a segment of a paraboloid of revolution; the volume of a segment of a hyperboloid of revolution; and the area of a spiral.Other mathematical achievements include deriving an accurate approximation of pi; defining and investigating the spiral that now bears his name; and creating a system using exponentiation for expressing very large numbers. [CLS] [SEP] He was also one of the first to apply mathematics to physical phenomena, founding hydrostatics and statics, including an explanation of the principle of the lever. [CLS] [SEP] He is credited with designing innovative machines, such as his screw pump, compound pulleys, and defensive war machines to protect his native Syracuse from invasion. [CLS] [SEP] Archimedes died during the Siege of Syracuse, where he was killed by a Roman soldier despite orders that he should not be harmed. [CLS] [SEP] Cicero describes visiting the tomb of Archimedes, which was surmounted by a sphere and a cylinder, which Archimedes had requested be placed on his tomb to represent his mathematical discoveries. [CLS] [SEP] Unlike his inventions, the mathematical writings of Archimedes were little known in antiquity. [CLS] [SEP] Mathematicians from Alexandria read and quoted him, but the first comprehensive compilation was not made until c. [CLS] [SEP] 530 AD by Isidore of Miletus in Byzantine Constantinople, while commentaries on the works of Archimedes written by Eutocius in the 6th century AD opened them to wider readership for the first time. [CLS] [SEP] The relatively few copies of Archimedes' written work that survived through the Middle Ages were an influential source of ideas for scientists during the Renaissance, while the discovery in 1906 of previously unknown works by Archimedes in the Archimedes Palimpsest has provided new insights into how he obtained mathematical results.
