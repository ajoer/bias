[CLS] Hurricane Frederic was an intense and damaging tropical cyclone that carved a path of damage from the Lesser Antilles to Quebec, in particular devastating areas of the United States Gulf Coast. [SEP] [CLS] Though only five were killed directly, the US$1.77 billion (equivalent to $5 billion in 2018) in damage accrued by Frederic made it the Atlantic basin's costliest tropical cyclone on record at the time. [SEP] [CLS] Prior to its final landfall, the threat that Frederic imposed on areas of the U.S. [SEP] [CLS] Gulf Coast triggered a mass exodus from the region larger than any other evacuation in the past. [SEP] [CLS] While the storm primarily impacted the U.S. [SEP] [CLS] states of Mississippi and Alabama, lesser effects were felt throughout the Greater and Lesser Antilles, as well as inland North America. [SEP] [CLS] Frederic developed from a tropical depression south of the Cape Verde Islands on August 28, 1979. [SEP] [CLS] Tracking at a steady clip westward, the primitive cyclone reached tropical storm intensity the next day. [SEP] [CLS] Favorable conditions in the open Atlantic allowed for Frederic to reach hurricane intensity on September 1. [SEP] [CLS] However, outflow from nearby Hurricane David began to inhibit further intensification and would continue to do so for roughly a week, weakening Frederic as it tracked across the Greater Antilles. [SEP] [CLS] The tropical cyclone nearly dissipated over Cuba before redeveloping on September 9 near the Isle of Youth. [SEP] [CLS] From then on, Frederic moved northwestward, intensifying to its peak intensity in the Gulf of Mexico with winds of 130 mph (210 km/h) on September 12, shortly before making landfall at Dauphin Island, Alabama just below the state line between Alabama and Mississippi. [SEP] [CLS] Over the United States, Frederic weakened for a final time before becoming extratropical in Pennsylvania on September 14 and dissipating the next day. [SEP] [CLS] Damage estimates vary due to inadequate reporting of private insurance claims as well as lack of hard data on uninsured damage; Frederic is believed to have inflicted $5 million (1979 USD) in both Puerto Rico and the U.S. [SEP] [CLS] Virgin Islands, with an additional $1.7 billion in damage on the mainland United States. [SEP] [CLS] FEMA, which had been established only three months before Frederic hit, was the focal point for nearly $250 million in federal aid for recovery, $188 million of which went to Alabama (1979 USD). [SEP] [CLS] In southern Alabama, the landscape was changed for years, with thousands of tall pine trees tilted and leaning northwest. [SEP] [CLS]
