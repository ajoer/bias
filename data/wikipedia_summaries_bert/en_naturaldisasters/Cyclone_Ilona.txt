Severe Tropical Cyclone Ilona caused moderate damage across the Pilbara region of Western Australia in mid-December 1988. [CLS] [SEP] The system originated from a monsoon trough that coalesced into a tropical low over the Timor Sea on 12 December. [CLS] [SEP] The system initially moved southwest, before moving on a more westerly course. [CLS] [SEP] Steady intensification occurred and Ilona reached its peak strength on 17 December as a low-end severe tropical cyclone. [CLS] [SEP] A southward turn directed the cyclone toward Western Australia, and it made landfall near Mardie Station. [CLS] [SEP] The system subsequently degraded over land and dissipated on 19 December. [CLS] [SEP] The cyclone's effects were relatively limited, though locally significant damage was reported in areas such as Dampier and Karratha. [CLS] [SEP] Several homes lost their roof and downed power lines left towns without power for several days. [CLS] [SEP] No casualties were reported, damage amounted to A$1 million (US$725,000), and the name Ilona was retired after the season. [CLS] [SEP]
