Severe Tropical Cyclone Ula was a powerful and long-lived tropical cyclone during late December 2015 and mid-January 2016. [CLS] [SEP] It originated from a tropical disturbance on December 26, 2015, east of the Solomon Islands. [CLS] [SEP] Moving generally east, development was initially slow and the system finally reached cyclone strength—having gale-force winds—on December 30. [CLS] [SEP] The newly christened Tropical Cyclone Ula turned sharply south and rapidly intensified, attaining hurricane-strength the following day. [CLS] [SEP] A shift to the southwest brought the system close to the northern islands of Tonga on January 2, 2016. [CLS] [SEP] It subsequently brushed several islands in the Lau Group of Fiji before weakening. [CLS] [SEP] Nearly degrading to a tropical depression, Ula turned to the northwest and regained strength. [CLS] [SEP] After turning back to the southwest, it achieved its peak intensity as a Category 4 on the Australian scale with winds of 185 km/h (115 mph) on January 10. [CLS] [SEP] Thereafter, the storm bypassed Vanuatu to the southeast and New Caledonia to the east as it accelerated southward. [CLS] [SEP] Throughout its existence, Ula affected several nations but its effects were largely limited, with only localized areas reporting damage. [CLS] [SEP] Dozens of structures were damaged or destroyed in Tuvalu while crops in Tonga, Fiji, and Vanuatu were impacted. [CLS] [SEP] No fatalities have been attributed to the storm, though one person was swept out to sea in American Samoa and was not found. [CLS] [SEP] Residents across the Lau Islands of Fiji required food security due to crop losses. [CLS] [SEP]
