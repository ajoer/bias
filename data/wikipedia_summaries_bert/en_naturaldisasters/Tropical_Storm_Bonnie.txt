Tropical Storm Bonnie was a tropical storm that made landfall on Florida in August 2004. [CLS] [SEP] The second storm of the 2004 Atlantic hurricane season, Bonnie developed from a tropical wave on August 3 to the east of the Lesser Antilles.

[CLS] [SEP] Bonnie attained peak winds of 65 miles per hour (105 km/h) over the Gulf of Mexico, turned to the northeast, and hit Florida as a 45 miles per hour (72 km/h) tropical storm. [CLS] [SEP] The storm accelerated to the northeast and became an extratropical cyclone to the east of New Jersey. [CLS] [SEP] Bonnie was the first of five tropical systems to make landfall on Florida in the 2004 Atlantic hurricane season, and the second of a record eight disturbances to reach tropical storm strength during the month of August. [CLS] [SEP] Bonnie's impact was minimal.
