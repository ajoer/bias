[CLS] Cyclone Mala was the strongest tropical cyclone of the 2006 North Indian Ocean cyclone season. [SEP] [CLS] In mid-April 2006, an area of disturbed weather formed over the southern Bay of Bengal and nearby Andaman Sea. [SEP] [CLS] Over a period of several days, the system became increasingly organized and was classified as a depression on April 24. [SEP] [CLS] Situated within a region of weak steering currents, the storm slowly intensified as it drifted in a general northward direction. [SEP] [CLS] It attained gale-force winds and was named Mala the next day. [SEP] [CLS] Conditions for strengthening improved markedly on April 27 and Mala subsequently underwent rapid intensification which culminated in the cyclone attaining its peak. [SEP] [CLS] Early on April 28, the cyclone had estimated winds of 185 km/h (115 mph). [SEP] [CLS] The Joint Typhoon Warning Center considered Mala to have been slightly stronger, classifying it as a Category 4-equivalent cyclone. [SEP] [CLS] Steady weakening ensued thereafter and the storm made landfall in Myanmar's Rakhine State on April 29. [SEP] [CLS] Rapid dissipation took place once onshore and Mala was last noted early the next morning. [SEP] [CLS] In contrast to Mala's intensity, damage was relatively minimal across Myanmar due to adequate early warnings, while timely and effective evacuations minimized loss of life along the coast. [SEP] [CLS] The greatest damage resulted from a thunderstorm near Yangon on April 28 that spawned a possible tornado in an industrial zone. [SEP] [CLS] A total of 586 homes were damaged there. [SEP] [CLS] Just outside the city in the Hinthada District, a flash flood killed at least 18 people. [SEP] [CLS] Overall, the storm claimed 37 lives in the country and left US$6.7 million in damage. [SEP] [CLS] In the wake of Mala, the Red Cross distributed relief aid to affected residents while local officials set up shelters to house those left homeless. [SEP] [CLS] Government and social organizations donated 5.4 million kyat (US$4,320) in cash to survivors in the Ayeyarwady Region. [SEP] [CLS]
