[CLS] Severe Tropical Cyclone Magda was a relatively small tropical cyclone that brought minor damage to parts of Western Australia in January 2010. [SEP] [CLS] The third named storm of the 2009â€“10 Australian region cyclone season, Magda originated from a tropical low near the Indonesian island of Roti on 18 January. [SEP] [CLS] Quickly strengthening, the system attained tropical cyclone status on 20 January and later reached severe tropical cyclone intensity on 21 January as it approached Western Australia. [SEP] [CLS] Late on 21 January, Magda made landfall in the Kimberley region with winds of 130 km/h (80 mph) before quickly weakening over land. [SEP] [CLS] The remnants of Magda persisted until 24 January, at which time they dissipated east of Port Hedland. [SEP] [CLS] Prior to Cyclone Magda's arrival, several severe weather warnings were issued for the coastline of Western Australia. [SEP] [CLS] Although the storm made landfall with winds of 130 km/h (80 mph), damage was limited due to the sparsely populated region it struck. [SEP] [CLS] The most severe damage was defoliation around Kuri Bay. [SEP] [CLS] Following its usage, the name Magda was retired and replaced with Megan. [SEP] [CLS]
