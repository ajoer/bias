[CLS] On Monday 4 September 2000, a chartered Beechcraft 200 Super King Air departed Perth for a flight to the mining town of Leonora, Western Australia. [SEP] [CLS] The aircraft crashed near Burketown, Queensland, Australia resulting in the deaths of all eight occupants. [SEP] [CLS] During the flight, the aircraft climbed above its assigned altitude. [SEP] [CLS] When air traffic control (ATC) contacted the pilot, the pilot's speech had become significantly impaired and he was unable to respond to instructions. [SEP] [CLS] Three aircraft intercepted the Beechcraft but were unable to make radio contact. [SEP] [CLS] The aircraft continued flying on a straight heading for five hours before running out of fuel and crashing 40 mi (65 km) south-east of Burketown. [SEP] [CLS] The crash became known in the media as the "Ghost Flight".A subsequent investigation concluded that the pilot and passengers had become incapacitated and had been suffering from hypoxia, a lack of oxygen to the body, meaning the pilot would have been unable to operate the aircraft. [SEP] [CLS] Towards the end of the flight, the left engine stopped due to fuel exhaustion and the aircraft crashed into the ground. [SEP] [CLS] The investigation report said that, due to extensive damage to the aircraft, investigators were unable to conclude if any of the eight aboard had used the oxygen system. [SEP] [CLS] The Australian Transport Safety Bureau (ATSB) final report could not determine what incapacitated the occupants. [SEP] [CLS] A number of safety recommendations were made following the crash. [SEP] [CLS]
