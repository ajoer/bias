[CLS] The 1884 Andalusian earthquake (Spanish: Terremoto de Andaluc√≠a de 1884) occurred in Andalusia, in the south of Spain, and had an estimated magnitude of 6.7 Mw. [SEP] [CLS] It shook a poor region where many of the houses were built without foundations, with lime or mud mortar, and with weak joints. [SEP] [CLS] 10,715 buildings were badly damaged, of which 4,399 were completely destroyed. [SEP] [CLS] Fortunately, many people were in the streets celebrating Christmas, or casualties would have been higher, but there were over 1,200 deaths and 1,500 serious injuries. [SEP] [CLS] The heavy snow that followed the earthquake caused further suffering and deaths. [SEP] [CLS] Help was slow to arrive at first, but as the news spread food and blankets arrived, then tents, and then donations from around the world helped with reconstruction. [SEP] [CLS]
