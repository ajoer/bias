[CLS] Hurricane Fern was the sixth named storm and fourth hurricane of the 1971 Atlantic hurricane season. [SEP] [CLS] It formed from a tropical wave which interacted with a large trough of low pressure to form Fern, as well as Hurricane Ginger, Tropical Storm Heidi, and a system later designated as Tropical Depression Sixteen, which moved into South Carolina. [SEP] [CLS] Fern crossed southeastern Louisiana as a tropical depression on September 4 before swinging back out over the Gulf of Mexico. [SEP] [CLS] Fern reached hurricane status on September 8, reaching a peak intensity of 90 mph (140 km/h) before making landfall near Freeport, Texas, two days later. [SEP] [CLS] Fern's path was erratic since it made 90Â° turns three times during its duration, making it difficult for forecasters to track. [SEP] [CLS] The second Atlantic tropical cyclone to make U.S. [SEP] [CLS] landfall that year, Fern produced heavy rainfall across Louisiana and Texas, causing flash flooding that left 2 indirect fatalities and damage totaling over $30 million (1971 USD, $183 million 2020 USD).
