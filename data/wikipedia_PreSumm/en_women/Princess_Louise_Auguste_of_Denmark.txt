[CLS] Princess Louise Augusta of Denmark and Norway (7 July 1771 – 13 January 1843) was the daughter of the Queen of Denmark, Caroline Matilda of Great Britain. [SEP] [CLS] Though officially regarded as the daughter of King Christian VII, it is widely accepted that her biological father was Johann Friedrich Struensee, the king’s royal physician and de facto regent of the country at the time of her birth. [SEP] [CLS] She was referred to sometimes as "la petite Struensee"; this did not, however, have any effect on her position. [SEP] [CLS]
