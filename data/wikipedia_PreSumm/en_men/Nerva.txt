[CLS] Nerva (; originally Marcus Cocceius Nerva; 8 November 30 – 27 January 98) was Roman emperor from 96 to 98. [SEP] [CLS] Nerva became emperor when aged almost 66, after a lifetime of imperial service under Nero and the rulers of the Flavian dynasty. [SEP] [CLS] Under Nero, he was a member of the imperial entourage and played a vital part in exposing the Pisonian conspiracy of 65. [SEP] [CLS] Later, as a loyalist to the Flavians, he attained consulships in 71 and 90 during the reigns of Vespasian and Domitian, respectively. [SEP] [CLS] On 18 September 96, Domitian was assassinated in a palace conspiracy involving members of the Praetorian Guard and several of his freedmen. [SEP] [CLS] On the same day, Nerva was declared emperor by the Roman Senate, although it is possible they were approving a decision made by the Praetorian Guard, as rare coins show him speaking with this group. [SEP] [CLS] As the new ruler of the Roman Empire, he vowed to restore liberties which had been curtailed during the autocratic government of Domitian. [SEP] [CLS] Nerva's brief reign was marred by financial difficulties and his inability to assert his authority over the Roman army. [SEP] [CLS] A revolt by the Praetorian Guard in October 97 essentially forced him to adopt an heir. [SEP] [CLS] After some deliberation Nerva adopted Trajan, a young and popular general, as his successor. [SEP] [CLS] After barely fifteen months in office, Nerva died of natural causes on 27 January 98. [SEP] [CLS] Upon his death he was succeeded and deified by Trajan. [SEP] [CLS] Although much of his life remains obscure, Nerva was considered a wise and moderate emperor by ancient historians. [SEP] [CLS] Nerva's greatest success was his ability to ensure a peaceful transition of power after his death by selecting Trajan as his heir, thus founding the Nerva–Antonine dynasty. [SEP] [CLS]
