Hurricane Ana was the second tropical cyclone in 2014 to threaten the U.S. [CLS] [SEP] state of Hawaii with a direct hit, after Iselle in August. [CLS] [SEP] The twenty-first named storm and fifteenth hurricane of the 2014 Pacific hurricane season, Ana formed from a disturbance that formed in the Central Pacific in mid-October. [CLS] [SEP] It rapidly consolidated, and a tropical depression developed by October 13. [CLS] [SEP] Aided by favorable conditions, Ana gradually strengthened while moving westward, threatening to pass over the island chain of Hawaii once or several times as indicated by early forecasts. [CLS] [SEP] By October 17, it had strengthened to a hurricane south of Hawaii and reached its peak intensity shortly afterwards while also making its closest approach. [CLS] [SEP] Afterwards, Ana weakened and began to fluctuate in intensity as it turned to the north and eventually northeast as it rounded a subtropical ridge and interacted with a cold front before becoming a hurricane briefly again on October 25. [CLS] [SEP] Ana transitioned into an extratropical cyclone on October 26, and raced across the northwest Pacific before dissipating by October 28 after it came ashore in Western Canada. [CLS] [SEP] Because Ana was originally forecasted to strike the Big Island of Hawaii early in its life, tropical storm watches and eventually warnings were issued in advance of the storm. [CLS] [SEP] These were later expanded across nearly the whole island chain as Ana nudged more to the west then forecasted. [CLS] [SEP] At its closest approach, Ana dropped heavy rain of nearly up to 11 inches (28 cm), although the heaviest rain missed Hawaii by nearly 20 miles (32 km), averting a potentially dangerous flooding scenario. [CLS] [SEP] The swath of tropical storm force winds missed the islands as well, minimizing damage by a great deal. [CLS] [SEP]
