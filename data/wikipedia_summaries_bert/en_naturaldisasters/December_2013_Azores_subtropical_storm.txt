[CLS] The 2013 Atlantic hurricane season was a well below average Atlantic hurricane season and the first since 1994 with no major hurricanes. [SEP] [CLS] It was a well below average season for both hurricanes and major hurricanes but it was a slightly above average season for named storms. [SEP] [CLS] It was also the first season since 1968 with no storms of at least Category 2 intensity on the Saffir–Simpson hurricane wind scale. [SEP] [CLS] The first tropical cyclone of this hurricane season, Andrea, developed on June 5, while the final cyclone, an unnamed subtropical storm, dissipated on December 7. [SEP] [CLS] Throughout the year, only two storms—Humberto and Ingrid—reached hurricane intensity; this was the lowest seasonal total since 1982. [SEP] [CLS] The season's impact was minimal; although 15 tropical cyclones developed, most were weak or remained at sea. [SEP] [CLS] Tropical Storm Andrea killed four people after making landfall in Florida and moving up the East Coast of the United States. [SEP] [CLS] In early July, Tropical Storm Chantal moved through the Leeward Islands, causing one fatality, but minimal damage overall. [SEP] [CLS] Tropical storms Dorian and Erin and Hurricane Humberto brought only squally weather to the Cape Verde Islands. [SEP] [CLS] Mexico, where Hurricane Ingrid, Tropical Depression Eight, and tropical storms Barry and Fernand all made landfall, was the hardest hit; Ingrid alone caused at least 32 deaths and $1.5 billion (2013 USD) in damage. [SEP] [CLS] In early October, Karen brought showers and gusty winds to the central Gulf Coast of the United States. [SEP] [CLS] All major forecasting agencies predicted an above-average season. [SEP] [CLS] All reduced their seasonal predictions in early August, but even the revised predictions were too high. [SEP] [CLS] The lack of activity was primarily caused by an unexpected significant weakening of the Atlantic Ocean thermohaline circulation between winter and spring. [SEP] [CLS] This resulted in continuation of the spring weather pattern over the Atlantic Ocean, with strong vertical wind shear, mid-level moisture, and atmospheric stability, which suppressed tropical cyclogenesis.
