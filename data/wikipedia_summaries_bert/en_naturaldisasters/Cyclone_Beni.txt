[CLS] Severe Tropical Cyclone Beni was an intense tropical cyclone that affected four countries, on its 18-day journey across the South Pacific Ocean during January and February 2003. [SEP] [CLS] The system originally developed during 19 January as a weak tropical disturbance within the monsoon trough, to the northeast of the Santa Cruz Islands. [SEP] [CLS] Over the next few days the system gradually developed further before it was classified as a tropical cyclone and named Beni during 24 January. [SEP] [CLS] Originally, the storm moved slowly towards the west. [SEP] [CLS] Initially moving towards the west, the cyclone then made a clockwise loop, and turned south. [SEP] [CLS] Beni entered more conductive conditions and began to strengthen while moving southeast. [SEP] [CLS] After attaining winds of hurricane-force, Beni strengthened rather quickly. [SEP] [CLS] Traveling between Vanuatu and New Caledonia, Beni reached its peak intensity on January 29 with winds of 125 mph (205 km/h 10-minute sustained), and a peak pressure of 920 mbar (27 inHg) before rapidly weakening. [SEP] [CLS] The cyclone made its closest approach to the island of New Caledonia on January 30; shortly after that, Beni weakened into a tropical depression. [SEP] [CLS] In the Coral Sea, however, the storm once again entered more favorable conditions and it briefly re-intensified into. [SEP] [CLS] However, this trend was short-lived; wind shear took its toll on the cyclone, weakening it back down to a tropical depression. [SEP] [CLS] The remnants of Beni proceeded to make landfall near Mackay, Queensland and produce heavy rain over much of the drought stricken state of Queensland until finally dissipating on February 5. [SEP] [CLS] The cyclone caused a food shortage and flooded portions of the Solomon Islands. [SEP] [CLS] Across the island group, about 2,000 people took shelter, some in caves. [SEP] [CLS] In addition, the storm brought storm surge and beach erosion to Vanuatu. [SEP] [CLS] New Caledonia faced power outages and heavy rains. [SEP] [CLS] In Queensland, Beni was responsible severe flooding. [SEP] [CLS] Two communities were isolated during the storm; a total of 160 people were also cut off by floodwater. [SEP] [CLS] The water level of one dam increased from 0.5% to 81%. [SEP] [CLS] The cyclone's heavy rains helped ease drought problems in Queensland; in fact, water reserves replenished five years worth of supply in one location. [SEP] [CLS] In all, one death was reported in Queensland and damages totaled to A$10 million (US$6 million, 2003 USD) in Queensland and US$1 million (A$2 million) in Vanuatu. [SEP] [CLS]
