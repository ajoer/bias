Typhoon Hato, known in the Philippines as Tropical Storm Isang, was a strong tropical cyclone that struck South China in August 2017. [CLS] [SEP] Developing as the thirteenth named storm and the fourth typhoon of the Pacific typhoon season, Hato formed as a tropical depression over the east of Luzon on 19 August. [CLS] [SEP] The system further developed and became a tropical storm the next day. [CLS] [SEP] On 21 August, Hato emerged over the northern portion of the South China Sea and reached typhoon intensity. [CLS] [SEP] Rapid intensification ensued on 23 August, and Hato became a Category 3-equivalent typhoon before making landfall over Jinwan, Zhuhai. [CLS] [SEP] The storm further weakened over land and dissipated on 24 August. [CLS] [SEP] One of the strongest typhoons to impact Macau and Hong Kong in the past 50 years, Hato caused significant damage totaling US$6.82 billion along its path. [CLS] [SEP] The bulk of the losses were incurred in Mainland China, where Hato brought a storm surge that caused severe flooding in several provinces along the Pearl River, in addition to wind gusts that reached 240 km/h (150 mph). [CLS] [SEP] Both Hong Kong and Macau had their tropical cyclone signals raised to the highest category in anticipation of the storm, which inflicted more than US$1 billion worth of damage in each of those areas. [CLS] [SEP] Also, while weakening, Hato brought heavy rain and a tornado to Vietnam. [CLS] [SEP] A total of 24 fatalities occurred due to Hato. [CLS] [SEP] Hato made landfall along the southern coast of Zhuhai with a Category-3 intensity (both 1-min and 2-min sustained wind speed of 185 km/h), strong but not stronger than other more powerful storms. [CLS] [SEP] Three other major typhoons, Wanda (1962), Ruby (1964), and Vicente (2012), followed a similar trajectory as that of Hato (from ESE to WNW), making landfall on slightly different parts of the coast. [CLS] [SEP] Hato's forward speed was the fastest of these typhoons, reaching 32.5 km/h (20.2 mph), nearly twice as fast as the speed of Wanda. [CLS] [SEP]
