[CLS] Theodore Ulrike Sophie von Levetzow, known as Baroness Ulrike von Levetzow (4 February 1804 – 13 November 1899) was a friend and the last love of Johann Wolfgang von Goethe. [SEP] [CLS] She was born at Löbnitz (today a part of Groitzsch) in Saxony, the daughter of the ducal Mecklenburg-Schwerin chamberlain and later Hofmarschall Joachim Otto Ulrich von Levetzow and his wife Amalie. [SEP] [CLS] The seventeen-year-old girl first met Goethe in 1821 at Marienbad and again at Carlsbad in 1822 and 1823. [SEP] [CLS] The poet, then 72, was so carried away with her wit and beauty that he thought for a time of marrying her and urged Grand Duke Karl August of Saxe-Weimar-Eisenach to ask for her hand in his name. [SEP] [CLS] Rejected, he left for Thuringia and addressed to her the poems which he afterward called Trilogie der Leidenschaft. [SEP] [CLS] These poems include the famous Marienbad Elegy. [SEP] [CLS] Ulrike later confessed she was not prepared to marry and angrily denied a liaison with Goethe. [SEP] [CLS] She remained unmarried all her life and died at the age of 95 at Trziblitz Castle in Bohemia. [SEP] [CLS]
