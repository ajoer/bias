Hurricane Noel was a deadly and very damaging tropical cyclone that carved a path of destruction across the Atlantic Ocean from the Caribbean Sea to Newfoundland in late October 2007. [CLS] [SEP] The sixteenth tropical depression, fourteenth named storm, and the sixth hurricane of the 2007 Atlantic hurricane season, Noel formed on October 27 from the interaction between a tropical wave and an upper-level low in the north-central Caribbean. [CLS] [SEP] It strengthened to winds of 60 mph (97 km/h) before making landfall on western Haiti and the north coast of eastern Cuba. [CLS] [SEP] Noel turned northward, and on November 1, it attained hurricane status. [CLS] [SEP] The hurricane accelerated northeastward after crossing the Bahamas, and on November 2, it transitioned into an extratropical cyclone. [CLS] [SEP] (The Canadian Hurricane Centre classified Noel as a "post-tropical storm" until 2200 UTC on November 4, when the CHC determined that Noel had lost all tropical characteristics.) The storm caused at least 163 direct deaths along its path, primarily in Dominican Republic and Haiti, due to flooding and mudslides. [CLS] [SEP] It was the deadliest North Atlantic hurricane of the 2007 hurricane season. [CLS] [SEP] After its extratropical transition, Noel became a very strong low pressure system, causing flooding and wind damage over Maine and Eastern Canada, with heavy rainfall occurring across Atlantic Canada, and snowfall over some areas of Eastern Quebec and Labrador. [CLS] [SEP] Noel's remnants subsequently merged with Cyclone Tilo, a powerful European windstorm, which later struck Western Europe and contributed to the North Sea flood of 2007 on the night of November 8â€“9.
