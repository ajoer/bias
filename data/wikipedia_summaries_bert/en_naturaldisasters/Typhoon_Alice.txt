The 1975 Pacific typhoon season was one of the deadliest tropical cyclone seasons on record, with nearly 230,000 fatalities occurring during the season. [CLS] [SEP] It had no official bounds; it ran year-round in 1975, but most tropical cyclones tend to form in the northwestern Pacific Ocean between June and December.

[CLS] [SEP] Tropical Storms formed in the entire west pacific basin were assigned a name by the Joint Typhoon Warning Center. [CLS] [SEP] Tropical depressions in this basin have the "W" suffix added to their number.
