[CLS] Hurricane Ophelia (known as Storm Ophelia in Ireland and the United Kingdom while extratropical) was regarded as the worst storm to affect Ireland in 50 years, and was also the easternmost Atlantic major hurricane on record. [SEP] [CLS] The tenth and final consecutive hurricane and the sixth major hurricane of the very active 2017 Atlantic hurricane season, Ophelia had non-tropical origins from a decaying cold front on 6 October. [SEP] [CLS] Located within a favorable environment, the storm steadily strengthened over the next two days, drifting north and then southeastwards before becoming a hurricane on 11 October. [SEP] [CLS] After becoming a Category 2 hurricane and fluctuating in intensity for a day, Ophelia intensified into a major hurricane on 14 October south of the Azores, brushing the archipelago with high winds and heavy rainfall. [SEP] [CLS] Shortly after achieving peak intensity, Ophelia began weakening as it accelerated over progressively colder waters to its northeast towards Ireland and Great Britain. [SEP] [CLS] Completing an extratropical transition early on 16 October, Ophelia became the second storm of the 2017â€“18 European windstorm season. [SEP] [CLS] Early on 17 October, the cyclone crossed the North Sea and struck western Norway, with wind gusts up to 70 kilometres per hour (43 mph) in Rogaland county, before weakening during the evening of 17 October. [SEP] [CLS] The system then moved across Scandinavia, before dissipating over Norway on the next day. [SEP] [CLS] Three deaths can be directly attributed to Ophelia, all of which occurred in Ireland. [SEP] [CLS] Total losses from the storm were less than initially feared, with a minimum estimate of total insured losses across Ireland and the United Kingdom of US$87.7 million. [SEP] [CLS]
