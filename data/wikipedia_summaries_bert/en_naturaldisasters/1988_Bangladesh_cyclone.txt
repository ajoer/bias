The 1988 Bangladesh cyclone (designated as Tropical Cyclone 04B by the Joint Typhoon Warning Center) was one of the worst tropical cyclones in Bangladeshi history. [CLS] [SEP] Striking in November 1988, the tropical system exacerbated the catastrophic damage from what was then considered the worst floods in Bangladesh's history. [CLS] [SEP] The tropical cyclone originated from a disturbance that developed within the Strait of Malacca on November 21. [CLS] [SEP] Tracking slowly westward, the initial tropical depression reached tropical storm status in the Andaman Sea. [CLS] [SEP] On November 26, the storm reached an intensity equivalent to that of a modern-day severe cyclonic storm and subsequently turned northward. [CLS] [SEP] Gradually intensifying as it had previously, the tropical cyclone reached peak intensity with winds of 125 mph (200 km/h) as it was making landfall near the Bangladeshâ€“India border on November 29. [CLS] [SEP] Although the storm retained strong winds well inland, it was last monitored over central Bangladesh as a moderate cyclonic storm-equivalent on November 30. [CLS] [SEP] The brunt of the tropical cyclone's damage was inflicted upon coastal areas of Bangladesh and West Bengal. [CLS] [SEP] A total of 6,240 people were killed as a result of the storm, with 5,708 in Bangladesh and 538 in West Bengal. [CLS] [SEP] Many of the deaths were a result of the destruction of homes or electrocution after strong winds toppled power poles across the region. [CLS] [SEP] Along the coast of Bangladesh, strong storm surge caused heavy infrastructure damage and contributed in wiping out an estimated 70% of all harvestable Bangladeshi crops, with an estimated 200,000 tonnes (220,000 tons) of crops being lost. [CLS] [SEP] Widespread power outages cut telecommunications across Bangladesh; in Dhaka, Bangladesh's capital city, debris-laden streets paralyzed traffic while electrical outages caused water shortages.
