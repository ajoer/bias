The 1980 El Asnam earthquake occurred on October 10 at 13:25:23 local time with a moment magnitude of 7.1 and a maximum Mercalli intensity of X (Extreme). [CLS] [SEP] The shock occurred in the Algerian town of El Asnam (now known as Chlef). [CLS] [SEP] The shocks were felt over 550 km (340 mi) away, with the initial earthquake lasting 35 seconds. [CLS] [SEP] It was the largest earthquake in Algeria, and was followed three hours later by a magnitude 6.2 aftershock. [CLS] [SEP] The earthquake created about 42 km (26 mi) of surface rupture and had a vertical slip of up to 4.2 m (14 ft). [CLS] [SEP] No foreshocks were recorded. [CLS] [SEP] The earthquake was found to have occurred very close to the epicenter of the 1954 earthquake using joint epicenter determination techniques. [CLS] [SEP] It occurred at a previously unknown reverse fault.The earthquake was the largest in the Atlas range since 1790.In addition to the earthquake, weak tsunami waves were recorded on tide gauges.The earthquake occurred at a populated region of Algeria, affecting 900,000 people. [CLS] [SEP] It destroyed 25,000 houses and made 300,000 inhabitants homeless. [CLS] [SEP] In addition to destroying homes, the earthquake also demolished critical infrastructure, including the main hospital, the central mosque, and a girls' school. [CLS] [SEP] The hospital was damaged significantly enough that victims had to be transported more than 160 km (100 mi) away to the next nearest hospital. [CLS] [SEP] Both events caused considerable damage with at least 2,633 killed and 8,369 injured. [CLS] [SEP] The earthquake caused approximately $5.2 billion in damage, which was 22% of Algeria's GDP at the time. [CLS] [SEP]
