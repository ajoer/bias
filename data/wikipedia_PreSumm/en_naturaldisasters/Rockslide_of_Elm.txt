[CLS] The rockslide of Elm (Canton of Glarus, Switzerland, in German Der Bergsturz von Elm) killed 115 people and destroyed 83 buildings on September 11, 1881. [SEP] [CLS] The catastrophe was partially caused by the mining of slate, beginning after 1870, by impoverished farmers who sought an additional source of income. [SEP] [CLS] Being inexperienced with proper mining techniques, they destabilized the rock face until the final catastrophe. [SEP] [CLS] The miners undercut the mountain face to a breadth of 180 m, and already in 1878 first rock movements occurred. [SEP] [CLS] A geological commission to examine the increasing number of rockfalls visited the scene shortly before the catastrophe, but did not find any indications of an impending disaster. [SEP] [CLS] The loud noise of the rockfalls, break-offs and fractures were already heard during the Sunday service on the morning of September 11, 1881. [SEP] [CLS] In spite of this, next to nobody left the dangerous area – in fact, many spectators went to the affected area or climbed to the nearby hamlet Düniberg on the opposing face of the valley in the hope of enjoying a better view of the spectacle. [SEP] [CLS] In the late afternoon, after two smaller rock slides, 10 million cubic meters (353 million cubic feet) of slate broke off, travelled 2 km (1.24 miles), and destroyed 90 hectares (222.4 acres) of land. [SEP] [CLS] The slate mine was also completely destroyed. [SEP] [CLS] The event and its causes were chronicled in the same year by the local priest Ernst Buss and the geologist Albert Heim in their publication "Der Bergsturz von Elm". [SEP] [CLS]
