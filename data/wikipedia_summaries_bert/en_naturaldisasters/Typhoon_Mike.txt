[CLS] Typhoon Mike, known in the Philippines as Typhoon Ruping, of 1990 was the strongest typhoon to hit the Philippines since Typhoon Irma in 1981. [SEP] [CLS] Forming from an area of persistent convection over the Caroline Islands, Mike was first designated on November 6, 1990 and moved generally westward. [SEP] [CLS] Later that day, the depression strengthened to Tropical Storm Mike near Yap. [SEP] [CLS] Mike became a typhoon early on November 9, and subsequently entered a period of rapid deepening. [SEP] [CLS] Late on November 10, the typhoon reached its maximum intensity of 115 mph (185 km/h), as estimated by the Japanese Meteorological Agency. [SEP] [CLS] After weakening slightly, Mike made landfall in the central Philippines, after weakening slightly. [SEP] [CLS] The storm weakened considerably due to land interaction, only to briefly re-intensify on November 14. [SEP] [CLS] Typhoon Mike turned west-northwest and later north-northwest, avoiding land interaction with Vietnam. [SEP] [CLS] Vertical wind shear increased, and on November 15, Mike weakened below typhoon intensity. [SEP] [CLS] Early the next day, the storm passed over western Hainan Island, and degraded to a tropical depression that night. [SEP] [CLS] After briefly emerging into the Gulf of Tonkin, Mike passed over southern China, where it dissipated on November 18. [SEP] [CLS] During its formative stages, Mike passed just north of Palau. [SEP] [CLS] There, one person was hurt and around 90% of the banana and coconut crops were leveled. [SEP] [CLS] A total of 1,035 houses and 10 businesses were damaged. [SEP] [CLS] Damage on the island totaled $2 million, including $1.3 million in property damage. [SEP] [CLS] After striking the Philippines, the typhoon brought widespread damage and was considered the worst typhoon to hit the country since Typhoon Ike in 1984. [SEP] [CLS] In Cebu City, 88 ships sunk, the most ships ever sunk at the Cebu City harbor during a tropical cyclone. [SEP] [CLS] Power and phone lines were downed and the city lost access to drinking water for two days. [SEP] [CLS] Approximately 60% of all buildings were demolished and 28 people perished in the city. [SEP] [CLS] Nationwide, 748 people were killed while 1,274 others suffered injuries. [SEP] [CLS] A total of 1,900,000 t (2,094,390 short tons) of sugar crops were destroyed. [SEP] [CLS] A total of 630,885 homes were damaged and 222,026 houses were demolished, resulting in 1,110,020 people displaced. [SEP] [CLS] Offshore, 159 vessels sunk and 28 others were washed aground and damaged. [SEP] [CLS] Monetary damage was estimated at $446 million (₱10.8 billion), including $46.1 million (₱1.12 billion) from crops, $350 million (₱8.52 billion) from public infrastructure, and $49.9 million (₱1.21 billion) from private infrastructure. [SEP] [CLS] At the time, Mike was the costliest tropical cyclone listed in the National Disaster Risk Reduction and Management Council's database, and as of 2014, is the seventh costliest typhoon to strike the country since independence in 1947. [SEP] [CLS] Elsewhere, 68 people were killed in Vietnam, but no damage was reported in China. [SEP] [CLS]
