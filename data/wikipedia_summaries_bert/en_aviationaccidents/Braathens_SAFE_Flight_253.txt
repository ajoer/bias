Braathens SAFE Flight 253, also known as the Hummelfjell Accident (Norwegian: Hummelfjell-ulykken), occurred on 7 November 1956 at 9:50, when a de Havilland Heron crashed into Hummelfjell mountain in Tolga, Norway. [CLS] [SEP] The Braathens SAFE aircraft was en route from Trondheim Airport, Værnes to Oslo Airport, Fornebu. [CLS] [SEP] While passing Røros, the Heron started experiencing a rapid atmospheric icing which soon was too extensive for the ice protection system to handle. [CLS] [SEP] Combined with a downdraft, the aircraft lost sufficient lift to stay airborne. [CLS] [SEP] The pilots were able to turn the aircraft around, but it nevertheless hit Hummelfjell at an altitude of 1,350 meters (4,430 ft) above mean sea level. [CLS] [SEP] The aircraft's captain was killed on impact, and a passenger died shortly afterwards. [CLS] [SEP] Ten people survived the crash, which was the first fatal accident of a Braathens SAFE. [CLS] [SEP] Among the survivors was Rolf Kirkvaag, at the time Norway's most popular radio host. [CLS] [SEP] The search and rescue operation was severely hindered by a blizzard and poor visibility. [CLS] [SEP] Kirkvaag and another person left the plane after a day and met a rescue party. [CLS] [SEP] The investigation concluded that neither technical faults with the aircraft nor pilot error played a part in the incident, and that it was not possible to predict the weather conditions which caused the icing.
