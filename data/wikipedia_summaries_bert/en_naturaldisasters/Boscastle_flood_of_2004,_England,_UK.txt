The 2004 Boscastle flood (Cornish: An Lanwes Kastel Boterel 2004) occurred on Monday, 16 August 2004 in the two villages of Boscastle and Crackington Haven in Cornwall, England, United Kingdom. [CLS] [SEP] The villages suffered extensive damage after flash floods caused by an exceptional amount of rain that fell over eight hours that afternoon. [CLS] [SEP] The flood in Boscastle was filmed and extensively reported but the floods in Crackington Haven and Rocky Valley were not mentioned beyond the local news. [CLS] [SEP] The floods were the worst in local memory. [CLS] [SEP] A study commissioned by the Environment Agency from hydraulics consulting firm HR Wallingford concluded that it was among the most extreme ever experienced in Britain. [CLS] [SEP] The peak flow was about 140 m3/s, between 5:00pm and 6:00pm BST. [CLS] [SEP] The annual chance of this (or a greater) flood in any one year is about 1 in 400. [CLS] [SEP] The probability each year of the heaviest three-hour rainfall is about 1 in 1300 (although rainfall probability is not the same as flood probability). [CLS] [SEP] At midday on 16 August 2004, heavy thundery showers had developed across the South West due to a weak disturbance to the northeast of the United Kingdom.The last time Boscastle had suffered notable flooding was in 1996 as a result of Hurricane Lili, but floods are recorded in 1847, 1957, on 3 June 1958 (one man drowned) and in 1963. [CLS] [SEP] On 16 August 1952 the small town of Lynmouth, 50 miles (80 km) north-east along the north coast in Devon near Exmoor, suffered extensive damage in a catastrophic flood, in which 34 people lost their lives. [CLS] [SEP] Coincidentally, this was 52 years to the day before Boscastle's 2004 flood. [CLS] [SEP]
