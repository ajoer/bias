Typhoon Lekima, known in the Philippines as Typhoon Hanna, was the costliest typhoon in Chinese history. [CLS] [SEP] The ninth named storm of the 2019 Pacific typhoon season, Lekima originated from a tropical depression that formed east of the Philippines on July 30. [CLS] [SEP] It gradually organized, became a tropical storm, and was named on August 4. [CLS] [SEP] Lekima intensified under favourable environmental conditions and peaked as a Category 4–equivalent super typhoon. [CLS] [SEP] However, an eyewall replacement cycle caused the typhoon to weaken before it made landfall in Zhejiang late on August 9, as a Category 2–equivalent typhoon. [CLS] [SEP] Lekima weakened subsequently while moving across Eastern China, and made its second landfall in Shandong on August 11. [CLS] [SEP] Lekima's precursor enhanced the southwestern monsoon in the Philippines, which brought heavy rain to the country. [CLS] [SEP] The rains caused three boats to sink and 31 people died in this accident. [CLS] [SEP] Lekima brought catastrophic damage in mainland China, with a death toll of 56 people and more than CN¥65.37 billion (US$9.26 billion) in damages. [CLS] [SEP] The system also caused minor damage in Ryukyu Islands and Taiwan. [CLS] [SEP] In Malaysia, the typhoon brought up strong tides and partially destroyed the coastal areas of Penang.
