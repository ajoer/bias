[CLS] Hurricane Babe was the second named storm and the first to impact the United States during the below-average 1977 Atlantic hurricane season. [SEP] [CLS] Forming out of a tropical wave on September 3, Babe began as a subtropical cyclone in the eastern Gulf of Mexico. [SEP] [CLS] The storm gradually intensified as it tracked westward. [SEP] [CLS] On September 5, the storm turned north and acquired tropical characteristics. [SEP] [CLS] Later that day, Babe intensified into a hurricane and attained its peak strength with winds of 75 mph (120 km/h) and a barometric pressure of 995 mbar (hPa; 29.38 inHg). [SEP] [CLS] Several hours later, the hurricane made landfall in Louisiana and quickly weakened. [SEP] [CLS] By September 6, Babe had weakened to a tropical depression and later dissipated early on September 9 over North Carolina. [SEP] [CLS] Hurricane Babe produced minimal impact throughout its path in the United States. [SEP] [CLS] The most significant impact occurred in Louisiana where the storm caused $10 million (1977 USD; $42.2 million 2020 USD) in damage, mainly from crop losses. [SEP] [CLS] An additional $3 million (1977 USD; $12.7 million 2020 USD) in losses resulted from tornadoes spawned by Babe. [SEP] [CLS] Heavy rainfall in North Carolina, peaking at 8.99 in (228 mm) triggered flash flooding but little damage. [SEP] [CLS] No fatalities resulted from the hurricane. [SEP] [CLS] Coincidentally, a typhoon, also named Babe, existed at exactly the same time as Hurricane Babe. [SEP] [CLS]
