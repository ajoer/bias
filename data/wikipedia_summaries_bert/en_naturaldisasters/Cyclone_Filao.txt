Cyclone Filao was a moderately intense tropical cyclone that caused widespread flooding in Mozambique in 1988. [CLS] [SEP] First classified as a tropical depression north of Madagascar, the system moved southwest, crossing the northern part of the nation before entering the Mozambique Channel on February 27, where it began to deepen. [CLS] [SEP] Later that day, the depression was upgraded into a moderate tropical storm. [CLS] [SEP] Two days later, Filao attained severe tropical storm intensity as it began to stall. [CLS] [SEP] On March 1, the storm reached cyclone intensity just before turning west. [CLS] [SEP] Later that day, Filao attained peak intensity, with winds of 135 km/h (85 mph) and a minimum barometric pressure of 954 mbar (hPa); 28.17 inHg. [CLS] [SEP] Within 24 hours, however, the system moved ashore near Quelimane in Central Mozambique, and several hours later, Filao dissipated inland. [CLS] [SEP] Cyclone Filao killed 100 people in Mozambique, primarily in rural areas. [CLS] [SEP] Damage was heaviest in Quelimane, where wind gusts reached 105 km/h (65 mph) and rainfall totaled 104 mm (4.1 in). [CLS] [SEP] There, 57 people were killed and 7,375 were left homeless. [CLS] [SEP] Elsewhere, the Pungwe River and Limpopo River experienced severe flooding, with the former sustaining its worst flood of the decade. [CLS] [SEP] Power and telephone services were also knocked out while a road that connected Mozambique to Zimbabwe was destroyed. [CLS] [SEP] In all, 5,500 ha (14,000 acres) of crops were destroyed. [CLS] [SEP] Damage totaled to $10 million, including $1.5 million in property damage. [CLS] [SEP]
