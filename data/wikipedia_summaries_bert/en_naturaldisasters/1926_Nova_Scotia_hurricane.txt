The 1926 Nova Scotia hurricane (also known as the 1926 Great August Gale) was one of the deadliest Canadian hurricanes in the 20th century. [CLS] [SEP] The second tropical cyclone and second hurricane of the season, the storm developed from a trough situated well east of the Leeward Islands on July 29. [CLS] [SEP] Over the next few days, it moved west-northwest, becoming a tropical storm by July 31. [CLS] [SEP] The cyclone turned to the northwest on August 1 and began strengthening rapidly, reaching hurricane intensity by the early afternoon. [CLS] [SEP] The next day, it became a major hurricane—equivalent to Category 3 intensity on the modern-day Saffir–Simpson hurricane wind scale. [CLS] [SEP] Over the next few days, the storm's track varied between north-northwest and northwest. [CLS] [SEP] Early on August 5, it peaked with winds of 120 mph (190 km/h). [CLS] [SEP] The hurricane then began weakening as it curved northward. [CLS] [SEP] The storm began losing tropical characteristics while approaching Atlantic Canada, transitioning into an extratropical cyclone on August 8. [CLS] [SEP] The remnants soon made landfall near Port Hawkesbury, Nova Scotia, with winds of 75 mph (121 km/h), before being last noted over Newfoundland later that day. [CLS] [SEP] The hurricane produced sustained winds of 54 mph (87 km/h) on Bermuda while passing about 80 mi (130 km) west of the island, but left minimal impact. [CLS] [SEP] In Atlantic Canada, the cyclone sank several ships and boats offshore Nova Scotia, including the schooners Sylvia Mosher and Sadie Knickle. [CLS] [SEP] A total of 55–58 deaths occurred, including at least 49 from those two ships crashing ashore Sable Island. [CLS] [SEP] On land, the storm downed trees and electrical poles in Nova Scotia, damaging some homes and leaving telephone service outages. [CLS] [SEP] Crops and fruit trees were also damaged. [CLS] [SEP] High winds interrupted telegraph communications in Newfoundland. [CLS] [SEP] Despite the number of fatalities, little was done to mitigate for a tropical cyclone prior to the hurricane in August 1927, which caused more than three times as many deaths.
