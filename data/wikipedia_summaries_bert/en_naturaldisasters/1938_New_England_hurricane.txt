The 1938 New England Hurricane (also referred to as the Great New England Hurricane) was one of the deadliest and most destructive tropical cyclones to strike Long Island, New York, and New England. [CLS] [SEP] The storm formed near the coast of Africa on September 9, becoming a Category 5 hurricane on the Saffirâ€“Simpson hurricane scale, before making landfall as a Category 3 hurricane on Long Island on September 21. [CLS] [SEP] It is estimated that the hurricane killed 682 people, damaged or destroyed more than 57,000 homes, and caused property losses estimated at $306 million ($4.7 billion in 2017). [CLS] [SEP] Damaged trees and buildings were still seen in the affected areas as late as 1951. [CLS] [SEP] It remains the most powerful and deadliest hurricane in recorded New England history, perhaps eclipsed in landfall intensity only by the Great Colonial Hurricane of 1635.At the time, roughly half of the 1938 New England hurricane's existence went unnoticed. [CLS] [SEP] The Atlantic hurricane reanalysis in 2013 concluded that the storm developed into a tropical depression on September 9 off the coast of West Africa, but the United States Weather Bureau was unaware that a tropical cyclone existed until September 16; by then, it was already a well-developed hurricane and had tracked westward toward the Sargasso Sea. [CLS] [SEP] It reached hurricane strength on September 15 and continued to strengthen to a peak intensity of 160 mph (260 km/h) near The Bahamas four days later, making it a Category 5-equivalent hurricane. [CLS] [SEP] The storm was propelled northward, rapidly paralleling the East Coast before making landfalls on Long Island and Connecticut as a Category 3-equivalent hurricane on September 21. [CLS] [SEP] After moving inland, it transitioned into an extratropical cyclone and dissipated over Ontario on September 23. [CLS] [SEP]
