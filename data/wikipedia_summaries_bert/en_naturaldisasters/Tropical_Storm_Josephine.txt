The 2020 Atlantic hurricane season is the first hurricane season on record in which nine tropical storms formed before August 1. [CLS] [SEP] It is an ongoing event in the annual cycle of tropical cyclone formation. [CLS] [SEP] During the season, a total of 12 tropical depressions, eleven tropical storms, and two hurricanes developed. [CLS] [SEP] The season officially started on June 1 and will officially end on November 30; however, the formation of tropical cyclones is possible at any time, as illustrated by the formations of tropical storms Arthur and Bertha, on May 16 and 27, respectively, marking the sixth consecutive year with pre-season systems. [CLS] [SEP] Earlier than normal activity continued into June, with Tropical Storm Cristobal becoming the earliest third named storm on record when it formed on June 2. [CLS] [SEP] In July, tropical storms Edouard, Fay, Gonzalo, Hanna, and Isaias became the earliest fifth, sixth, seventh, eighth, and ninth named storms, forming on July 4, 9, 21, 23, and 30 respectively. [CLS] [SEP] The trend continued in August, with tropical storms Josephine and Kyle becoming the earliest tenth and eleventh named storms, forming on August 13 and 14, respectively. [CLS] [SEP] In late May, Bertha caused over $200 million (2020 USD) in damage and one fatality when it made landfall on and crossed the East Coast of the United States. [CLS] [SEP] A week later in June, Cristobal caused 15 deaths and $675 million in damage across Mexico, Guatemala, and the United States. [CLS] [SEP] In July, Fay brought tropical storm force winds across Delaware, New Jersey, and coastal New York, resulting in $400 million in damage and six deaths. [CLS] [SEP] Gonzalo brought minor impacts to southern parts of the Lesser Antilles. [CLS] [SEP] Hanna, the season's first hurricane, made landfall in South Texas as a Category 1 hurricane, leaving at least $500 million in damage. [CLS] [SEP] Isaias, the second hurricane of the season, brought impacts to much of the Eastern Caribbean and Florida, made landfall in North Carolina at its peak intensity as a strong Category 1 hurricane, and brought widespread power outages and a destructive tornado outbreak to the Eastern United States, overall causing $4.2 billion in damage. [CLS] [SEP] Due to the ongoing COVID-19 pandemic, officials in the United States have expressed concerns about the hurricane season potentially exacerbating the effects of the pandemic. [CLS] [SEP] Evacuations would be significantly hindered due to fears of contracting the virus, and the worry that social distancing rules would break down when giving aid to hurricane-affected areas. [CLS] [SEP] As Hurricane Hanna approached landfall, local officials underscored the reality of the coronavirus when warning residents living in flood-prone neighborhoods about the prospect of evacuation.
