[CLS] Mervyn Laurence Peake (9 July 1911 â€“ 17 November 1968) was an English writer, artist, poet, and illustrator. [SEP] [CLS] He is best known for what are usually referred to as the Gormenghast books. [SEP] [CLS] The three works were part of what Peake conceived as a lengthy cycle, the completion of which was prevented by his death. [SEP] [CLS] They are sometimes compared to the work of his older contemporary J. [SEP] [CLS] R. [SEP] [CLS] R. [SEP] [CLS] Tolkien, but Peake's surreal fiction was influenced by his early love for Charles Dickens and Robert Louis Stevenson rather than Tolkien's studies of mythology and philology. [SEP] [CLS] Peake also wrote poetry and literary nonsense in verse form, short stories for adults and children (Letters from a Lost Uncle, 1948), stage and radio plays, and Mr Pye (1953), a relatively tightly-structured novel in which God implicitly mocks the evangelical pretensions and cosy world-view of the eponymous hero. [SEP] [CLS] Peake first made his reputation as a painter and illustrator during the 1930s and 1940s, when he lived in London, and he was commissioned to produce portraits of well-known people. [SEP] [CLS] For a short time at the end of World War II he was commissioned by various newspapers to depict war scenes. [SEP] [CLS] A collection of his drawings is still in the possession of his family. [SEP] [CLS] Although he gained little popular success in his lifetime, his work was highly respected by his peers, and his friends included Dylan Thomas and Graham Greene. [SEP] [CLS] His works are now included in the collections of the National Portrait Gallery, the Imperial War Museum and The National Archives. [SEP] [CLS] In 2008, The Times named Peake among their list of "The 50 greatest British writers since 1945". [SEP] [CLS]
