[CLS] Cyclone Inigo was tied with Cyclone Gwenda for being the most intense recorded cyclone in the Australian region in terms of pressure, with the possible exception of Cyclone Mahina. [SEP] [CLS] Inigo developed from a tropical low that crossed eastern Indonesia in late March 2003. [SEP] [CLS] Becoming a named tropical cyclone on 1 April, Inigo rapidly intensified as it tracked southwestward, reaching a minimum central pressure of 900 hPa on 4 April. [SEP] [CLS] An approaching trough weakened the cyclone and turned it to the southeast, and on 8 April, Inigo dissipated after making landfall on Western Australia, as a minimal tropical storm. [SEP] [CLS] The precursor disturbance dropped heavy rainfall across eastern Indonesia, causing widespread flooding and mudslides. [SEP] [CLS] The worst of the damage was on Flores island, though damage was also reported on West Timor and Sumba. [SEP] [CLS] The flooding and mudslides damaged or destroyed thousands of houses, forcing many to leave their homes. [SEP] [CLS] A total of 58 casualties were reported in association with Inigo, as a disturbance. [SEP] [CLS] In Australia, Inigo produced locally heavy rainfall, but did little damage. [SEP] [CLS]
