[CLS] Hurricane Flossie was a powerful Pacific tropical cyclone that brought squally weather and light damage to Hawaii in August 2007. [SEP] [CLS] The sixth named storm, second hurricane, first and only major hurricane of the inactive 2007 Pacific hurricane season, Flossie originated from a tropical wave that emerged off Africa on July 21. [SEP] [CLS] After traversing the tropical Atlantic, the wave crossed Central America and entered the eastern Pacific on August 1. [SEP] [CLS] There, a favorable environment allowed it to become a tropical depression and a tropical storm shortly thereafter on August 8. [SEP] [CLS] Tracking generally west-southwestward, the storm entered a stage of rapid deepening on August 10, despite forecasts of an only marginally favorable environment. [SEP] [CLS] On August 11, Flossie became a major hurricane, reaching its peak intensity with winds of 140 mph (220 km/h). [SEP] [CLS] With cooler sea surface temperatures and high wind shear in its path, the hurricane weakened steadily, deteriorating to a tropical depression by August 16. [SEP] [CLS] The storm's center became devoid of strong thunderstorms later that day, indicating Flossie no longer qualified as a tropical cyclone. [SEP] [CLS] As a strong storm, Flossie prompted hurricane and tropical storm warnings for the Big Island of Hawaii. [SEP] [CLS] Residents were warned by emergency officials to prepare for over a foot of rainfall and wind gusts well within tropical storm force. [SEP] [CLS] However, impact was negligible; the peak wind gust on the Big Island of Hawaii reached 39 mph (63 km/h), and rainfall totals remained below 6 inches (150 mm). [SEP] [CLS]
