Typhoon Maemi (pronounced [mɛ.mi]), known in the Philippines as Typhoon Pogi, was the most powerful typhoon to strike South Korea since record-keeping began in the country in 1904. [CLS] [SEP] Maemi formed on September 4, 2003 from a disturbance in a monsoon trough in the western Pacific Ocean. [CLS] [SEP] It slowly intensified into Tropical Storm Maemi while moving northwestward, becoming a typhoon on September 8. [CLS] [SEP] That day, favorable conditions facilitated more rapid strengthening; the storm developed a well-defined eye and reached peak maximum sustained winds of 195 km/h (120 mph). [CLS] [SEP] While near peak intensity, Maemi decelerated and began turning to the north-northeast. [CLS] [SEP] Soon after, the eyewall passed over the Japanese island of Miyako-jima on September 10 and produced an air pressure reading of 912 mbar (26.9 inHg), the fourth-lowest recorded in the nation. [CLS] [SEP] Due to warm waters, Maemi was able to maintain much of its intensity before it made landfall just west of Busan, South Korea, on September 12. [CLS] [SEP] The typhoon became extratropical in the Sea of Japan the next day, although its remnants persisted for several days, lashing northern Japan with strong winds. [CLS] [SEP] The typhoon first affected the Ryukyu Islands of Japan. [CLS] [SEP] On Miyako-jima, strong winds damaged 104 buildings and left 95% of residents without power. [CLS] [SEP] Maemi caused heavy rainfall there, with rates of 58.5 mm (2.30 in) in an hour and 402.5 mm (15.85 in) in 24 hours, the latter setting a record. [CLS] [SEP] One person died on Miyako-jima after being struck by airborne debris. [CLS] [SEP] Elsewhere in Japan, the storm caused flights to be canceled, and rainfall-induced landslides blocked roads. [CLS] [SEP] There were two other deaths in Japan, and damage totaled ¥11.3 billion yen (JPY, $96 million USD). [CLS] [SEP] Damage was heaviest in South Korea, particularly where it moved ashore. [CLS] [SEP] On Jeju Island, Maemi produced a peak wind gust of 216 km/h (134 mph) and a minimum pressure of 950 mbar (28 inHg), both setting records for the country; the pressure reading broke the longstanding lowest pressure set by Typhoon Sarah in 1959. [CLS] [SEP] Winds in Busan near the landfall location reached 154 km/h (96 mph), the second-highest on record. [CLS] [SEP] The port there sustained heavy damage, restricting exports in the months following the storm. [CLS] [SEP] Nationwide, the high winds destroyed about 5,000 houses and damaged 13,000 homes and businesses, leaving 25,000 people homeless. [CLS] [SEP] About 1.47 million households lost power, and widespread crop damage occurred, resulting in the poorest rice harvest in 23 years. [CLS] [SEP] Across South Korea, Maemi killed 117 people, and overall damage totaled ₩5.52 trillion won (KRW, US$4.8 billion). [CLS] [SEP]
