[CLS] Cyclone Hudah was a powerful and destructive tropical cyclone that affected Southeast Africa in April 2000. [SEP] [CLS] It was the last in a series of three cyclones that impacted Madagascar during the year. [SEP] [CLS] Hudah first developed as a disturbance embedded within the monsoon trough on March 22, within the Australian region cyclone basin. [SEP] [CLS] Moving westward as the result of a strong subtropical ridge to its south, the storm quickly intensified, and reached Category 2 cyclone intensity on March 25 before entering the Southwest Indian cyclone basin. [SEP] [CLS] For various reasons that remain unknown, the cyclone was only designated a name by the time it had crossed into the area of responsibility of the Regional Specialized Meteorological Center in Réunion. [SEP] [CLS] Nonetheless, Météo-France (MFR) assigned the name Hudah to the cyclone. [SEP] [CLS] An eye formed, and the storm intensified into a tropical cyclone on March 27 well to the southeast of Diego Garcia. [SEP] [CLS] On April 1, the MFR upgraded it to a very intense tropical cyclone, estimating peak 10 minute winds of 225 km/h (140 mph). [SEP] [CLS] By contrast, the Joint Typhoon Warning Center (JTWC) estimated 1 minute winds of 235 km/h (145 mph). [SEP] [CLS] Cyclone Hudah maintained peak winds until making landfall just southeast of Antalaha, Madagascar on April 2. [SEP] [CLS] It weakened greatly over land, but re-attained tropical cyclone status on April 5 after moving over the Mozambique Channel. [SEP] [CLS] Hudah reached 10 minute winds of 160 km/h (100 mph) by the time it made landfall on Mozambique near Pebane, Mozambique, on April 8, and dissipated by the next day. [SEP] [CLS] While in the vicinity, Hudah brought moderate winds to Rodrigues, St. [SEP] [CLS] Brandon, and Tromelin Island. [SEP] [CLS] The cyclone affected the same parts of Madagascar that were previously impacted by cyclones Eline and Gloria. [SEP] [CLS] Waves reached at least 8 m (26 ft) in height along the coast. [SEP] [CLS] The storm was considered the worst to affect the Antalaha region in 20 years, where 90% of homes were destroyed. [SEP] [CLS] It was estimated that the storm left at least 100,000 people homeless in Madagascar, and there were 111 deaths. [SEP] [CLS] In Mozambique, damage was much less than expected, and the storm affected areas farther north in the country than where Eline struck. [SEP] [CLS] Heavy rainfall occurred along the coast, but was insufficient to cause river flooding. [SEP] [CLS] Strong winds damaged roofs and downed trees, mostly around Pebane, and the storm killed three people. [SEP] [CLS]
