On 26 June 1950, a Douglas DC-4 Skymaster aircraft departed from Perth, Western Australia for an eight-hour flight to Adelaide, South Australia. [CLS] [SEP] It crashed 22 minutes after take-off, 35 miles (56 km) East from Perth Airport. [CLS] [SEP] All 29 occupants were killed in the accident; one initially survived, but died six days later. [CLS] [SEP] It was the worst civil aviation accident in Australia.As the aircraft flew eastwards over the outer suburbs of Perth numerous witnesses observed that it was flying at a lower altitude than usual for the daily Skymaster services, and at least one of the engines was running roughly and backfiring at regular intervals. [CLS] [SEP] In the minutes before it crashed, witnesses heard a number of different engine noises â€“ sometimes operating normally, sometimes all engine noise ceased, only to be replaced by what was described as a very loud, high-pitched "scream". [CLS] [SEP] When the wrecked engines were examined many weeks after the accident a significant amount of corrosion product was found in the fuel system within two of the engines. [CLS] [SEP] After a preliminary investigation, Investigators from the Department of Civil Aviation believed the water responsible for the corrosion was also responsible for rough running of at least one engine, and ultimately temporary loss of power from all engines on at least one occasion. [CLS] [SEP] The Investigators did not find a likely source for the water. [CLS] [SEP] All but one of the 29 occupants on board the aircraft died, either from multiple injuries and burns, or from incineration. [CLS] [SEP] One elderly male passenger survived the crash. [CLS] [SEP] The first rescuers at the crash site found him wandering about, dazed and distressed. [CLS] [SEP] He suffered serious burns and was admitted to hospital where he died six days later. [CLS] [SEP] The accident became the subject of an Inquiry chaired by a Supreme Court judge. [CLS] [SEP] In the absence of evidence indicating the source of any water in the fuel, the Inquiry dismissed the submission that water was responsible for the accident. [CLS] [SEP] The Inquiry did not determine the cause of the accident but it made recommendations to enhance the safety of aircraft operations. [CLS] [SEP]
