Wolfgang Amadeus Mozart (27 January 1756 â€“ 5 December 1791), baptised as Johannes Chrysostomus Wolfgangus Theophilus Mozart, was a prolific and influential composer of the Classical period. [CLS] [SEP] Born in Salzburg, in the Holy Roman Empire, Mozart showed prodigious ability from his earliest childhood. [CLS] [SEP] Already competent on keyboard and violin, he composed from the age of five and performed before European royalty. [CLS] [SEP] At 17, Mozart was engaged as a musician at the Salzburg court but grew restless and travelled in search of a better position. [CLS] [SEP] While visiting Vienna in 1781, he was dismissed from his Salzburg position. [CLS] [SEP] He chose to stay in Vienna, where he achieved fame but little financial security. [CLS] [SEP] During his final years in Vienna, he composed many of his best-known symphonies, concertos, and operas, and portions of the Requiem, which was largely unfinished at the time of his early death at the age of 35. [CLS] [SEP] The circumstances of his death have been much mythologized. [CLS] [SEP] He composed more than 600 works, many of which are acknowledged as pinnacles of symphonic, concertante, chamber, operatic, and choral music. [CLS] [SEP] He is considered among the greatest classical composers of all time, and his influence on Western music is profound. [CLS] [SEP] Ludwig van Beethoven composed his early works in the shadow of Mozart, and Joseph Haydn wrote: "posterity will not see such a talent again in 100 years". [CLS] [SEP]
