Severe Tropical Cyclone Esau was the strongest tropical cyclone to affect New Caledonia on record. [CLS] [SEP] A shallow tropical depression developed within the monsoon trough during 24 February, about 370 km (230 mi) to the northeast of Port Vila, Vanuatu. [CLS] [SEP] Over the next day, the system gradually developed further as it moved towards the south-west under the influence of a northerly steering flow, before it passed over Pentecost Island in northern Vanuatu during 25 February. [CLS] [SEP] After passing over Pentecost the system continued to move towards the southwest and passed near the island of Malampa before the depression turned northwards and executed a small clockwise loop as it passed over the island of Espiritu Santo. [CLS] [SEP] The system was subsequently named Esau during 26 February, after it had developed into a tropical cyclone. [CLS] [SEP] Over the next couple of days, the system moved south-westwards towards Australia and away from the islands of Vanuatu. [CLS] [SEP] Esau subsequently executed a second clockwise loop during 28 February, before it peaked as a Category 4 tropical cyclone on both the Australian tropical cyclone intensity scale and the Saffir-Simpson hurricane wind scale. [CLS] [SEP] After it had peaked the system moved south-eastwards and threatened Southern Vanuatu, before turning southwards and threatening the French overseas territory of New Caledonia. [CLS] [SEP] Esau made landfall on the French territory during 4 March, as a category 3 severe tropical cyclone before degenerating into an extratropical cyclone during 5 March. [CLS] [SEP] The systems remnants made landfall on New Zealand's North Island during 8 March, before they were last noted during the next day over the South Pacific Ocean. [CLS] [SEP] Esau caused minimal damage and one death, as it affected the Solomon Islands, Vanuatu, New Caledonia and New Zealand. [CLS] [SEP] The system affected the northern Vanuatu Islands between 25–27 February and 2–3 March, with heavy rain and strong winds of up to 80 km/h (50 mph) but caused no damage. [CLS] [SEP] Esau produced gale-force winds on the Solomon Islands of Rennell and Bellona and knocked down several banana, coconut and pawpaw trees. [CLS] [SEP] The system also destroyed several houses and severely flooded various taro gardens and food crops. [CLS] [SEP] Esau produced hurricane-force winds on New Caledonia, while extensive flooding was reported in the territory. [CLS] [SEP] Several roads were blocked as the system blew down trees and damaged buildings, while power and communications were also knocked out over the island. [CLS] [SEP] One person drowned as she tried to cross a river near Hienghene, while a young child went missing on the island of Lifou but was later found safe by local residents. [CLS] [SEP] The extra-tropical remnants of Esau made landfall on New Zealand's North Island during 8 March, where hail and a tornado were reported to have occurred. [CLS] [SEP] The name Esau was subsequently retired from the list of tropical cyclone names for the South Pacific basin. [CLS] [SEP]
