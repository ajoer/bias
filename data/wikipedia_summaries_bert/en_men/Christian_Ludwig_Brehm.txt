[CLS] Christian Ludwig Brehm (24 January 1787 – 23 June 1864) was a German pastor and ornithologist. [SEP] [CLS] He was the father of the zoologist Alfred Brehm. [SEP] [CLS] Brehm was born near Gotha, and studied at the University of Jena. [SEP] [CLS] In 1813 he became the minister at Renthendorf, a village sixty miles south of Leipzig, where he remained until his death. [SEP] [CLS] His extensive writings included Beiträge zur Vogelkunde (1820–22), which described 104 species of German birds in minute detail, and Handbuch der Naturgeschichte aller Vögel Deutschlands (1831). [SEP] [CLS] Brehm accumulated a collection of 15,000 bird skins. [SEP] [CLS] He offered these to the Berlin Zoological Museum, but the sale fell through. [SEP] [CLS] After his death they remained in the attic of his house, where Otto Kleinschmidt discovered them some years later. [SEP] [CLS] Kleinschmidt persuaded Lord Rothschild to buy them, and the collection arrived at his Natural History Museum at Tring. [SEP] [CLS]
