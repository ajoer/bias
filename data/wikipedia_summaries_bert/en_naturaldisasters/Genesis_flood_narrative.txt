The Genesis flood narrative is a flood myth found in the Tanakh (chapters 6â€“9 in the Book of Genesis). [CLS] [SEP] The story tells of God's decision to return the Earth to its pre-creation state of watery chaos and then remake it in a reversal of creation. [CLS] [SEP] The narrative has very strong similarities to parts of the Epic of Gilgamesh which predates the Book of Genesis. [CLS] [SEP] A global flood as described in this myth is inconsistent with the physical findings of geology, paleontology and the global distribution of species. [CLS] [SEP] A branch of creationism known as flood geology is a pseudoscientific attempt to argue that such a global flood actually occurred. [CLS] [SEP]
