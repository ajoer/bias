[CLS] Hurricane Marco caused significant flooding in the Greater Antilles and Central America, despite remaining well offshore. [SEP] [CLS] The thirteenth tropical cyclone, thirteenth named storm, and ninth hurricane of the 1996 Atlantic hurricane season, Marco developed in the western Caribbean Sea on November 16 after the interaction of a cold front and several tropical waves. [SEP] [CLS] Initially a tropical depression, it remained weak as it tracked southwestward and eventually southward. [SEP] [CLS] By November 19, the depression strengthened into Tropical Storm Marco, shortly before slowly curving in a general eastward direction. [SEP] [CLS] Marco briefly became a hurricane on November 20, though upper-level winds caused it to weaken back to a tropical storm later that day. [SEP] [CLS] The storm then tracked northeastward toward Hispaniola, but later become nearly stationary and curve eastward, then doubled-back to the west. [SEP] [CLS] After weakening to a tropical depression on November 23, Marco re-strengthened to a tropical storm on the following day. [SEP] [CLS] Marco tracked northwestward while fluctuating in intensity before finally weakening and dissipating on November 26. [SEP] [CLS] Despite not making landfall, Marco produced heavy rainfall in Cuba, Hispaniola, Central America, and Jamaica, which caused significant flooding in some areas. [SEP] [CLS] In Honduras, 4,000 homes were destroyed, 40 bridges washed away, nearly 50,000 acres of banana and fruit plantations flooded, and nine deaths were reported. [SEP] [CLS] Flooding also effected other Central American countries, albeit effects were less severe. [SEP] [CLS] Heavy rainfall was reported in Cuba, although flood damage is unknown.
