[SEP] [CLS] A fairly weak tropical cyclone, it caused some notable damage in Bangladesh and India. [SEP] [CLS] An area of low pressure formed within the Bay of Bengal on October 24. [SEP] [CLS] It was designated as Depression BOB 05 the next day by the India Meteorological Department. [SEP] [CLS] The depression was declared a deep depression early on October 26, whilst the Joint Typhoon Warning Center designated the depression as Cyclone 04B later that day with wind speeds equivalent to a tropical storm. [SEP] [CLS] Later that day, the IMD upgraded the deep depression into a cyclonic storm and named it as Rashmi. [SEP] [CLS] Rashmi then reached both its peak one- and three-minute sustained wind speeds, as it made landfall on the Bangladesh coast late on October 26. [SEP] [CLS] Early the next day the JTWC issued its final advisory on Rashmi as the IMD downgraded Rashmi to a deep depression. [SEP] [CLS] Later that day the IMD, having noted that Rashmi had weakened rapidly, downgraded the deep depression to a well marked area of low pressure and released their final advisory. [SEP] [CLS] The name Rashmi was submitted by Sri Lanka, to the World Meteorological Organisation's Tropical Cyclone Committee.
