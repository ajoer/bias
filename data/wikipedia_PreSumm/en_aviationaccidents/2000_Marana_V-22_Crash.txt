[CLS] On 8 April 2000, a V-22 Osprey aircraft operated by the United States Marine Corps crashed during a night training exercise at Marana Regional Airport near Tucson, Arizona. [SEP] [CLS] The crash killed all 19 U.S. [SEP] [CLS] Marines on board and intensified debate about the reliability of the Osprey. [SEP] [CLS] It was later determined that the aircraft had entered an aerodynamic condition known as vortex ring state, which resulted from a high rate of descent compounded by pilot error. [SEP] [CLS] As a result of the investigation findings, the V-22 was subject to further redesign, but nevertheless entered operational service in 2007. [SEP] [CLS]
