[CLS] Severe Tropical Cyclone Namu was considered to be the worst tropical cyclone to have affected the Solomon Islands on record. [SEP] [CLS] On May 15, 1986, a tropical depression formed within the monsoon trough. [SEP] [CLS] Located north of the Solomon Islands, the storm steadily intensified while meandering. [SEP] [CLS] After briefly moving west, the storm attained Category 2 intensity on the Australian intensity scale on May 18, as it moved through the island chain on the next day. [SEP] [CLS] Cyclone Namu attained peak intensity of 120 km/h (75 mph). [SEP] [CLS] After retaining its peak intensity for a day, Namu turned south and weakened steadily. [SEP] [CLS] By May 21, the winds of Cyclone Namu had been reduced to only 80 km/h (50 mph). [SEP] [CLS] Continuing to weaken, Namu turned east and dissipated on May 22, away from the island chain. [SEP] [CLS] The storm's slow motion allowed for prolonged periods of heavy rainfall, resulting in phenomenal flooding across the Solomon Islands. [SEP] [CLS] The islands of Malaita and Guadalcanal experienced the most significant damage from Namu. [SEP] [CLS] Coastal areas of the former were severely damaged by rough seas and strong winds, especially along the eastern side where entire villages were destroyed. [SEP] [CLS] Meanwhile, on the island of Guadalcanal, a village of 43 people had only 5 survivors. [SEP] [CLS] Moreover, Cyclone Namu flooded 75% of the Guadalcanal's plains. [SEP] [CLS] In addition, 22% of homes were either damaged or destroyed on the island. [SEP] [CLS] Across the Solomon Island group, schools, buildings, electricity, water supplies, roads, communication systems, forests, and agriculture sustained widespread damage. [SEP] [CLS] In some regions, nearly all homes were destroyed. [SEP] [CLS] Mudslides destroyed roads, bridges, water pipes and drainage systems. [SEP] [CLS] Crops such as cocoa, copra, coffee, and rice were destroyed. [SEP] [CLS] Villages throughout the entire island group sustained severe damage. [SEP] [CLS] Overall, approximately 90,000 people, one third of the country's population, were reported as homeless. [SEP] [CLS] In all, Cyclone Namu was responsible for at least 150 deaths, mostly from flooding and landslides. [SEP] [CLS] Property damage and economic losses across the Solomon Islands totaled $25 million and $100 million (1986 USD) respectively. [SEP] [CLS] During the aftermath of the storm, the government of the Solomon Islands declared a national state of emergency. [SEP] [CLS] Meanwhile, the United Kingdom, Papua New Guinea, the United States, and Japan also sent supplies and goods to the Solomon Islands. [SEP] [CLS]
