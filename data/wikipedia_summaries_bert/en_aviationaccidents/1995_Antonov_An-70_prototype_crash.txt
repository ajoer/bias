The Antonov An-70 (Ukrainian: Антонов Ан-70) is a four-engine medium-range transport aircraft, and the first aircraft to take flight powered only by propfan engines. [CLS] [SEP] It was developed in the late 1980s by the Antonov Design Bureau to replace the obsolete An-12 military transport aircraft. [CLS] [SEP] The maiden flight of the first prototype took place in December 1994 in Kiev, now independent Ukraine. [CLS] [SEP] Within months the prototype had suffered a mid-air collision. [CLS] [SEP] A second airframe was produced to allow the flight-test programme to proceed. [CLS] [SEP] Both prototypes were produced by the Kiev Aircraft Production Plant. [CLS] [SEP] Following the dissolution of the Soviet Union in the early 1990s, the programme became a joint development between Russia and Ukraine. [CLS] [SEP] The former compounded the issue of a reduced market with its intermittent commitment to the project. [CLS] [SEP] Repeated attempts to start production have had limited success. [CLS] [SEP] Western European countries, including Germany, at one stage assessed the aircraft for procurement, but many later decided against it. [CLS] [SEP]
