[SEP] [CLS] His reign is commonly considered to mark the end of the golden period in the history of the Roman Empire known as the Pax Romana. [SEP] [CLS] He accompanied Marcus his father during the Marcomannic Wars in 172 and on a tour of the Eastern provinces in 176. [SEP] [CLS] He was made the youngest consul in Roman history in 177 and later that year elevated to co-emperor with his father. [SEP] [CLS] During his solo reign, the Empire enjoyed a period of reduced military conflict compared with the reign of Marcus Aurelius, but intrigues and conspiracies abounded, leading Commodus to an increasingly dictatorial style of leadership that culminated in a god-like personality cult, with him performing as a gladiator in the Colosseum. [SEP] [CLS] His assassination in 192 marked the end of the Nerva–Antonine dynasty. [SEP] [CLS] He was succeeded by Pertinax, the first emperor in the tumultuous Year of the Five Emperors.
