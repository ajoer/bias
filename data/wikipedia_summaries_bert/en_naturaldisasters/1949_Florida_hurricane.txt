The 1949 Florida hurricane, also known as the Delray Beach hurricane, caused significant damage in the southern portions of the state late in the month of August. [CLS] [SEP] The second recorded tropical cyclone of the annual hurricane season, the system originated from a tropical wave near the northern Leeward Islands on August 23. [CLS] [SEP] Already a tropical storm upon initial observations, the cyclone curved west-northwestward and intensified, becoming a hurricane on August 25. [CLS] [SEP] Rapid intensification ensued as the storm approached the central Bahamas early on August 26, with the storm reaching Category 4 hurricane strength later that day and peaking with maximum sustained winds of 130 mph (215 km/h) shortly after striking Andros. [CLS] [SEP] Late on August 26, the storm made landfall near Lake Worth, Florida, at the same intensity. [CLS] [SEP] The cyclone initially weakened quickly after moving inland, falling to Category 1 status early the next day. [CLS] [SEP] Shortly thereafter, the system curved northward over the Nature Coast and entered Georgia on August 28, where it weakened to a tropical storm. [CLS] [SEP] The storm then accelerated northeastward and became extratropical over New England by August 29. [CLS] [SEP] The remnants traversed Atlantic Canada and much of the Atlantic Ocean before dissipating near Ireland on September 1. [CLS] [SEP] The hurricane produced strong winds in the Bahamas, including a wind gust of 120 mph (195 km/h) on Bimini. [CLS] [SEP] A wide expanse of the east coast of Florida, stretching from Miami Beach to St. [CLS] [SEP] Augustine, observed hurricane-force winds, while much of the state recorded winds of at least 50 mph (80 km/h). [CLS] [SEP] Closer to the location of landfall, the city of Lake Worth observed a sustained winds speed of 127 mph (204 km/h). [CLS] [SEP] Palm Beach County was one of the worst impacted areas, with 65 homes destroyed and 13,283 others damaged to some degree. [CLS] [SEP] Just to the north, Martin County also received extensive impact, with severe damage inflicted to about 40% of homes and commercial buildings in Stuart. [CLS] [SEP] Overall, the hurricane damaged about 18,000 homes, while roughly 1,000 other structures suffered severe damage or destruction in Florida. [CLS] [SEP] About $45 million in damage occurred in the state, which included $20 million in damage to crops, $18 million to property, $4 million electrical and communications, and $500,000 to road infrastructure. [CLS] [SEP] Damage throughout the United States totaled about $52.35 million and three deaths occurred, two in Florida and one in Georgia. [CLS] [SEP]
