Baroness Anna Elisabeth Franziska Adolphine Wilhelmine Louise Maria von Droste zu Hülshoff, known as Annette von Droste-Hülshoff (German: [aˈnɛtə fɔn ˈdʁɔstəˈhʏlshɔf] (listen); 10 or 12 January 1797 – 24 May 1848), was a 19th-century German writer and composer. [CLS] [SEP] She was one of the most important German poets and author of the novella Die Judenbuche. [CLS] [SEP] In an article for the 1913 Catholic Encyclopedia, Francis Joste wrote, "The fame of the poetess rests chiefly on her lyric poems, her pastorales, and her ballads. [CLS] [SEP] In the poetic representation of nature, few can equal her. [CLS] [SEP] The poetical works of Annette von Droste-Hülshoff are imperishable. [CLS] [SEP] What makes them so is their originality, the proof that they are the works of a genius. [CLS] [SEP] It is this too that gained for their author the well-earned title of "Germany's greatest poetess.'"
