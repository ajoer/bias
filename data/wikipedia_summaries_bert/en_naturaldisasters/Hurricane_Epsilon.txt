[CLS] Hurricane Epsilon was the final of fifteen hurricanes within the record-breaking 2005 Atlantic hurricane season. [SEP] [CLS] Originating from a cold front beneath an upper-level low, Epsilon formed on November 29 about 915 mi (1470 km) east of Bermuda. [SEP] [CLS] Initially, the National Hurricane Center (NHC) forecast the storm to transition into an extratropical cyclone within five days, due to conditions unfavorable for significant intensification. [SEP] [CLS] Epsilon continually defied forecasts, at first due to an unexpected loop to the southwest, and later due to retaining its strength despite cold waters and strong wind shear. [SEP] [CLS] On December 1, Epsilon began a northeast motion due to an approaching trough, and the next day it attained hurricane status. [SEP] [CLS] After turning to the east, it developed characteristics of an annular hurricane, meaning it had a circular eye, a ring of convection, and had few fluctuations in its intensity. [SEP] [CLS] On December 5 Epsilon attained peak winds of 85 mph (140 km/h), and the next day it turned to the south and southwest. [SEP] [CLS] Late on December 7, the winds dropped below hurricane status for the first time in five days, making Epsilon the longest-lasting December hurricane on record. [SEP] [CLS] Stronger wind shear caused rapid weakening, and the storm could no longer be classified as a tropical cyclone late on December 8. [SEP] [CLS] The next day the remnant circulation of Epsilon dissipated. [SEP] [CLS]
