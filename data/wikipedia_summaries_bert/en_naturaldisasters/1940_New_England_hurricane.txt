The 1940 New England hurricane moved off of the U.S. [CLS] [SEP] East Coast and Atlantic Canada in August and September 1940, producing strong winds and torrential rainfall. [CLS] [SEP] The fourth tropical cyclone and third hurricane of the season, the storm originated from a well-defined low-pressure area in the open Atlantic Ocean on August 26. [CLS] [SEP] Moving slowly in a general west-northwest motion, the disturbance intensified, reaching tropical storm strength on August 28 and subsequently hurricane intensity on August 30. [CLS] [SEP] The hurricane passed within 85 mi (135 km) of Cape Hatteras before recurving towards the northeast. [CLS] [SEP] The hurricane continued to intensify, and reached peak intensity as a Category 2 hurricane with maximum sustained winds of 110 mph (175 km/h) and a minimum barometric pressure of 961 mbar (hPa; 28.38 inHg), though these statistical peaks were achieved at different times on September 2. [CLS] [SEP] Afterwards, the hurricane began a weakening trend as it proceeded northeastward, and had degenerated into a tropical storm by the time it made its first landfall on Nova Scotia later that day. [CLS] [SEP] The storm transitioned into an extratropical cyclone the next day while making another landfall on New Brunswick. [CLS] [SEP] The extratropical remnants persisted into Quebec before merging with a larger extratropical system late on September 3. [CLS] [SEP] Despite not making landfall on the United States, the hurricane caused widespread damage. [CLS] [SEP] Extensive precautionary measures were undertaken across the coast, particularly in New England. [CLS] [SEP] The heightened precautions were due in part to fears that effects from the storm would be similar to that of a devastating hurricane that struck the region two years prior. [CLS] [SEP] Most of the damage associated with the hurricane occurred in New Jersey, where the combination of moisture from the hurricane and a stationary front produced record rainfall, peaking at 24 in (610 mm) in the town of Ewan. [CLS] [SEP] This would make the storm the wettest in state history. [CLS] [SEP] The resultant floods damaged infrastructure, mostly to road networks. [CLS] [SEP] Damage in the state amounted to $4 million. [CLS] [SEP] Farther north in New England, strong winds were reported, though damage remained minimal. [CLS] [SEP] Although the storm made two landfalls in Atlantic Canada, damage there too was minimal, and was limited to several boating incidents caused by strong waves. [CLS] [SEP] Overall, the hurricane caused seven fatalities. [CLS] [SEP]
