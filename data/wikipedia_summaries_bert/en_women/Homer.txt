Homer (; Ancient Greek: Ὅμηρος Greek pronunciation: [hómɛːros], Hómēros) is the presumed author of the Iliad and the Odyssey, two epic poems that are the central works of ancient Greek literature. [CLS] [SEP] The Iliad is set during the Trojan War, the ten-year siege of the city of Troy by a coalition of Greek kingdoms. [CLS] [SEP] It focuses on a quarrel between King Agamemnon and the warrior Achilles lasting a few weeks during the last year of the war. [CLS] [SEP] The Odyssey focuses on the ten-year journey home of Odysseus, king of Ithaca, after the fall of Troy. [CLS] [SEP] Many accounts of Homer's life circulated in classical antiquity, the most widespread being that he was a blind bard from Ionia, a region of central coastal Anatolia in present-day Turkey. [CLS] [SEP] Modern scholars consider these accounts legendary.The Homeric Question – concerning by whom, when, where and under what circumstances the Iliad and Odyssey were composed – continues to be debated. [CLS] [SEP] Broadly speaking, modern scholarly opinion falls into two groups. [CLS] [SEP] One holds that most of the Iliad and (according to some) the Odyssey are the works of a single poet of genius. [CLS] [SEP] The other considers the Homeric poems to be the result of a process of working and reworking by many contributors, and that "Homer" is best seen as a label for an entire tradition. [CLS] [SEP] It is generally accepted that the poems were composed at some point around the late eighth or early seventh century BC.The poems are in Homeric Greek, also known as Epic Greek, a literary language which shows a mixture of features of the Ionic and Aeolic dialects from different centuries; the predominant influence is Eastern Ionic. [CLS] [SEP] Most researchers believe that the poems were originally transmitted orally. [CLS] [SEP] From antiquity until the present day, the influence of Homeric epic on Western civilization has been great, inspiring many of its most famous works of literature, music, art and film. [CLS] [SEP] The Homeric epics were the greatest influence on ancient Greek culture and education; to Plato, Homer was simply the one who "has taught Greece" – ten Hellada pepaideuken. [CLS] [SEP]
