[CLS] The Braer Storm was the most intense extratropical cyclone ever recorded over the northern Atlantic Ocean. [SEP] [CLS] Developing as a weak frontal wave on 8 January 1993, the system moved rapidly northeast. [SEP] [CLS] The combination of the absorption of a second low-pressure area to its southeast, a stronger than normal sea surface temperature differential along its path, and the presence of a strong jet stream aloft led to a rapid strengthening of the storm, with its central pressure falling to an estimated 913 mb (27.0 inHg) on 11 January. [SEP] [CLS] Its strength was well predicted by forecasters in the United Kingdom, and warnings were issued before the low initially developed. [SEP] [CLS] Gale-force winds covered the far northern Atlantic between Western Europe and Atlantic Canada, due to the intensity of this storm, with hurricane-force winds confined near its center of circulation. [SEP] [CLS] After reaching its peak intensity, the system weakened as it moved into the far northeast Atlantic, dissipating by 17 January. [SEP] [CLS] This storm caused severe blizzards across much of Scotland. [SEP] [CLS] It also led to the final breakup of the oil tanker MV Braer, from which the storm derived its name; it had been stranded in rocks off the Shetland Islands by a previous storm nearly a week beforehand.
