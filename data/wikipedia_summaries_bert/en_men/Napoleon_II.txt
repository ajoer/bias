Napoléon François Joseph Charles Bonaparte (20 March 1811 – 22 July 1832), Prince Imperial, King of Rome, known in the Austrian court as Franz from 1814 onward, Duke of Reichstadt from 1818, was the son of Napoleon I, Emperor of the French, and his second wife, Archduchess Marie Louise of Austria.

[CLS] [SEP] His nickname of L'Aiglon ("the Eaglet") was awarded posthumously and was popularized by the Edmond Rostand play, L'Aiglon. [CLS] [SEP] When Napoleon I tried to abdicate on 4 April 1814, he said that his son would rule as emperor.
