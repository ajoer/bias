The 1948 Litang earthquake (1948年理塘地震) occurred on May 28, 1948 at 07:11 UTC. [CLS] [SEP] It was located near Litang, China. [CLS] [SEP] Now situated in the Sichuan Province, Litang County was then called Lihua (or Lihwa) (理化) County and belonged to the defunct Xikang (or Sikang) Province. [CLS] [SEP] The earthquake had a magnitude of Mw 7.2, or Ms 7.3.This earthquake caused more than 800 deaths. [CLS] [SEP] More than 600 houses collapsed in the areas around Litang and Daocheng. [CLS] [SEP] Landslides, ground fissures and sandblows occurred in the region. [CLS] [SEP] The intensity of the earthquake reached MM X. [CLS] [SEP] Some of the aftershocks caused additional damage.The earthquake occurred in the middle segment between Litang and Dewu (德巫) of the Litang-Dewu fault zone (理塘-德巫断裂带). [CLS] [SEP] Litang Fault, situated in the Sichuan-Yunnan rhombic block (川滇菱形块体), is a NW-trending fault and dominated mainly by left-lateral shear movement. [CLS] [SEP] The average horizontal slip rate of the Litang Fault is about 3.2 to 4.4 mm/yr on the Litang-Dewu segment and about 2.6 to 3.0 mm/yr on the segment to the north of Litang. [CLS] [SEP] A study of Wang et al. [CLS] [SEP] estimated that the Litang fault has a left-lateral strike-slip rate of 4.4±1.3 mm/yr and an extension rate of 2.7±1.1 mm/yr. [CLS] [SEP] The focal mechanism was recognized to be a left-lateral slip on a plane striking northwest (315°) for a distance of about 75 km. [CLS] [SEP] The released seismic moment was estimated to be about 7.4×1019 Nm. [CLS] [SEP]
