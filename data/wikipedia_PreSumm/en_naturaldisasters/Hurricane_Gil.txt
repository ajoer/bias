[CLS] Hurricane Gil was the first of several tropical cyclones to affect Hawaii during the 1983 Pacific hurricane season. [SEP] [CLS] Gil originated from a tropical depression that developed near Clipperton Island on July 23. [SEP] [CLS] Steadily intensifying, it attained tropical storm status six hours later and was upgraded to a hurricane on July 26. [SEP] [CLS] After attaining peak intensity on July 27, Gil encountered cooler sea surface temperatures and began to weaken. [SEP] [CLS] Moving west-northwest, the weakening system also accelerated and on July 31, was downgraded to a tropical depression. [SEP] [CLS] However, Gil began to re-intensify on August 1, becoming a tropical storm again later that day. [SEP] [CLS] Initially expected to veer north of Hawaii, it continued west-northwest and began to approach the Hawaiian group on August 3. [SEP] [CLS] While passing through the island group, Gil reached its secondary peak intensity. [SEP] [CLS] Subsequently, Gil began to weaken once again as it threatened the Northwestern Hawaiian Islands. [SEP] [CLS] After passing through the islands, Gil was downgraded to a tropical depression on August 5. [SEP] [CLS] Several hours later, the storm dissipated. [SEP] [CLS] The remnants of the storm moved into the West Pacific late on August 6 and were last noted the next morning while passing south of Midway Island. [SEP] [CLS] Due to fears of a repeat of Hurricane Iwa, which devastated the island group the previous year, officials issued many tropical cyclone warnings and watches while seven shelters were opened, though few people actually used these shelters. [SEP] [CLS] On Oahu, a power outage was reported, affecting 2,400 customers. [SEP] [CLS] Jellyfish also stung 50 people. [SEP] [CLS] Locally heavy rainfall and rough seas led to minor damage while strong winds lead to extensive damage on the north side of the island. [SEP] [CLS] On Maui and Kauai, minor flooding, as well, though damage was minimal. [SEP] [CLS] Offshore, one person is presumed to have died in a shipwreck. [SEP] [CLS] In a separate shipping incident, three crewmen were slightly injured. [SEP] [CLS] The remnants of Gil later affected the Northwestern Hawaiian Islands, where near-gale force winds were measured. [SEP] [CLS] Throughout the state, damage was minimal. [SEP] [CLS]
