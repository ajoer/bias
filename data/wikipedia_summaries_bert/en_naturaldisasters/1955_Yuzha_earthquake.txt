[CLS] The 1955 Yuzha earthquake (1955年鱼鲊地震) occurred on September 23, 1955, at 15:06 UTC (23:06 local time). [SEP] [CLS] The epicenter was located in the area around Lazha (拉鲊), Dalongtan (大龙潭) Township, Renhe District, Panzhihua and Yuzha (鱼鲊) Township, Huili County. [SEP] [CLS] Lazha then belonged to Yongren County, Yunnan and now within Sichuan. [SEP] [CLS] Yuzha then belonged to Huili County, Sichuan as it still does. [SEP] [CLS] The earthquake had a magnitude of Ms 6.8.728 people were reported dead and 1547 injured in the earthquake. [SEP] [CLS] More than 15000 rooms collapsed. [SEP] [CLS] Eight people died and seven houses collapsed in the Xigeda (昔格达) Village. [SEP] [CLS] Cracks ranging from 10 to 70 cm in width and 100 to 1,500 m in length occurred on hillsides and ridges. [SEP] [CLS] Landslides were observed along both banks of the Jinsha River. [SEP] [CLS] Many villages on both banks of the Jinsha River were destroyed. [SEP] [CLS] Rivers and springs dried up, and many new springs appeared. [SEP] [CLS] Changes of water level in wells and ditches were reported. [SEP] [CLS] Many villages on both banks of the Jinsha River were destroyed. [SEP] [CLS] Along the Jinsha River and its surrounding gullies, large quantities of rocks broke, fell, and dammed up the gullies. [SEP] [CLS] In the Jinsha River, waves surged 1 m high. [SEP] [CLS] The maximum intensity reached MM IX. [SEP] [CLS] The shaking could be felt as far as about 400 km away.The Xigeda-Yuanmou fault (昔格达—元谋断裂带), about 270 km long, is the seismogenic structure of this earthquake. [SEP] [CLS] From the distribution of the isoseismals of this earthquake, it was suggested that there is a three-layered structure. [SEP] [CLS] There is a rupture layer, and there are two complete rock layers located in both sides of the rupture layer. [SEP] [CLS] The rupture layer is the place where the stress was concentrated and released and has the role of reflecting the seismic wave propagation. [SEP] [CLS]
