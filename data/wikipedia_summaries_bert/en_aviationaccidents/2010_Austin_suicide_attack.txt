[CLS] The 2010 Austin suicide attack occurred on February 18, 2010, when Andrew Joseph Stack III deliberately crashed his single-engine Piper Dakota light aircraft into Building I of the Echelon office complex in Austin, Texas, United States, killing himself and Internal Revenue Service (IRS) manager Vernon Hunter. [SEP] [CLS] Thirteen others were injured, two severely. [SEP] [CLS] The four-story office building housed an IRS field office occupying the top three floors, along with a couple of private businesses on the first floor. [SEP] [CLS] Prior to the crash, Stack had posted a suicide note to his web site, expressing his disillusionment with corporations and government agencies such as the IRS. [SEP] [CLS] Stack is also suspected of having set fire that morning to his two-story North Austin house, which was mostly destroyed. [SEP] [CLS] In the aftermath, there was increased debate over the policies of the IRS, and different forms of protest. [SEP] [CLS] In response to the attack, the IRS spent more than $38.6 million, with $6.4 million spent to recover and resume work at the building, and over $32 million spent to increase security at other IRS sites in the U.S. [SEP] [CLS] However, the spending on security changes was questioned as being ineffective. [SEP] [CLS] The building was repaired by December 2011. [SEP] [CLS]
