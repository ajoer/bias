[CLS] Hurricane Rick is the third-most intense Pacific hurricane on record and the second-most intense tropical cyclone worldwide in 2009 (only behind Typhoon Nida). [SEP] [CLS] Rick develop in the south of Mexico on October 15, Rick traversed an area favoring rapid intensification, allowing it to become a hurricane within 24 hours of being declared a tropical depression. [SEP] [CLS] An eye began to form during the afternoon of October 16; once fully formed, the storm underwent another period of rapid strengthening. [SEP] [CLS] During the afternoon of October 17, the storm attained Category 5 status on the Saffir–Simpson hurricane wind scale. [SEP] [CLS] Several hours later, Rick attained its peak intensity as the third-strongest Pacific hurricane on record with winds of 180 mph (285 km/h) and a barometric pressure of 906 mbar (hPa; 26.75 inHg). [SEP] [CLS] After maintaining this intensity for several hours, Rick began to weaken in response to a combination of an eyewall replacement cycle and increasing wind shear. [SEP] [CLS] By October 19, the storm was downgraded to a Category 3 hurricane and the following day to a tropical storm. [SEP] [CLS] The long-anticipated northeast turn took place near the end of this phase, also accompanied by a brief decrease in forward motion. [SEP] [CLS] On October 21, Rick quickly moved northeast, brushing the tip of Baja California Sur before making landfall near Mazatlán with winds of 60 mph (97 km/h; 52 kn). [SEP] [CLS] Several hours after moving inland, the final advisory from the NHC was issued as the storm weakened to a tropical depression and dissipated. [SEP] [CLS] Prior to landfall, the National Hurricane Center (NHC) initially forecast Rick to make landfall in southern Baja California as a high-end Category 2 hurricane, prompting hurricane watches. [SEP] [CLS] Officials ordered several hundred residents to evacuate from low-lying areas, although tropical storm warnings replaced the hurricane watches after the storm had weakened. [SEP] [CLS] Overall, the damage from Rick was significantly less than initially anticipated. [SEP] [CLS] In Mexico, three people were killed by the storm, one in Oaxaca and two in Baja California Sur. [SEP] [CLS]
