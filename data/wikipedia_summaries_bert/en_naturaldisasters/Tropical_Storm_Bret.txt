Tropical Storm Bret was the earliest named storm to develop in the Main Development Region of the Atlantic basin on record. [CLS] [SEP] Bret formed from a low-latitude tropical wave that had moved off the coast of Africa on June 12. [CLS] [SEP] The disturbance moved swiftly across the Atlantic for several days, steadily organizing despite its low latitude. [CLS] [SEP] On June 18, the organization increased enough for the National Hurricane Center (NHC) to begin issuing warnings disturbance while it was located southeast of the Windward Islands. [CLS] [SEP] The system continued to organize, and by the next day, it had developed into a tropical storm, the second of the 2017 Atlantic hurricane season. [CLS] [SEP] Bret continued moving swiftly to the west and struck Trinidad and Tobago early on June 20, before entering the Caribbean Sea, dissipating shortly afterwards. [CLS] [SEP] Starting in the 2017 season, the NHC changed its policy to allow tropical storm watches and warnings to be issued for tropical disturbances that do not yet satisfy the definition of a tropical cyclone but are expected to in short order while posing the threat of tropical-storm-force winds to landmasses. [CLS] [SEP] Thus, on June 18, although the vigorous tropical wave—the precursor to Bret—did not meet formal classification standards, the NHC began issuing advisories on what was considered a potential tropical cyclone. [CLS] [SEP] Bret left about $3 million (2017 USD) in damage and two deaths, with both in Trinidad and Tobago. [CLS] [SEP]
