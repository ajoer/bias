[CLS] [SEP] On 8 April, Olivia intensified into a severe tropical cyclone and subsequently turned more to the south, steered by a passing trough.

[CLS] [SEP] The storm quickly weakened over land, dissipating over the Great Australian Bight on 12 April. [CLS] [SEP] While in its formative stages, Olivia produced light rainfall in the Northern Territory.
