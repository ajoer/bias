Georges Henri Joseph Édouard Lemaître, ( lə-MET-rə, French: [ʒɔʁʒ ləmɛːtʁ] (listen); 17 July 1894 – 20 June 1966) was a Belgian Catholic priest, mathematician, astronomer, and professor of physics at the Catholic University of Louvain. [CLS] [SEP] He was the first to identify that the recession of nearby galaxies can be explained by a theory of an expanding universe, which was observationally confirmed soon afterwards by Edwin Hubble. [CLS] [SEP] He was the first to derive what used to be known as "Hubble's law", but since 2018 has officially been renamed the Hubble–Lemaître law, and made the first estimation of what is still called the Hubble constant, which he published in 1927, two years before Hubble's article. [CLS] [SEP] Lemaître also proposed what later became known as the "Big Bang theory" of the origin of the universe, initially calling it the "hypothesis of the primeval atom". [CLS] [SEP]
