[CLS] The Great Blizzard of 1947 was a record-breaking snowfall that began on Christmas without prediction and brought the northeastern United States to a standstill. [SEP] [CLS] The snowstorm was described as the worst blizzard after 1888. [SEP] [CLS] The storm was not accompanied by high winds, but the snow fell silently and steadily. [SEP] [CLS] By the time it stopped on December 26, measurement of the snowfall reached 26.4 inches (67.1 cm) in Central Park in Manhattan. [SEP] [CLS] Meteorological records indicate that warm moisture arising from the Gulf Stream fed the storm's energy when it encountered its cold air and greatly increased the precipitation. [SEP] [CLS] Automobiles and buses were stranded in the streets, subway service was halted, and parked vehicles initially buried by the snowfall were blocked further by packed mounds created by snow plows once they were able to begin operation. [SEP] [CLS] Once trains resumed running, they ran twelve hours late. [SEP] [CLS] Seventy-seven deaths are attributed to the blizzard. [SEP] [CLS]
