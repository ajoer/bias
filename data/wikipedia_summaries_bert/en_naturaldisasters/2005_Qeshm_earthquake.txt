The 2005 Qeshm earthquake occurred on November 27 at 13:52 IRST (10:22 UTC) on the sparsely populated Qeshm Island off Southern Iran, killing 13 people and devastating 13 villages. [CLS] [SEP] It was Iran's second major earthquake of 2005, following that at Zarand in February. [CLS] [SEP] The epicenter was about 1,500 kilometers (930 mi) south of Tehran, close to Iran's southern borders. [CLS] [SEP] Initial measurements showed that the earthquake registered about 6.0 on the moment magnitude scale, although that was reduced to 5.8 after further analysis. [CLS] [SEP] More than 400 minor aftershocks followed the main quake, 36 of which were greater than magnitude 2.5. [CLS] [SEP] The earthquake occurred in a remote area during the middle of the day, limiting the number of fatalities. [CLS] [SEP] Iranian relief efforts were effective and largely adequate, leading the country to decline offers of support from other nations and UNICEF. [CLS] [SEP] Qeshm Island is part of the Simply Folded Belt, the most seismically active part of the Zagros fold and thrust belt. [CLS] [SEP] Similar to most earthquakes in the area, the 2005 event resulted from reverse slip faulting. [CLS] [SEP] Since it lies in such a seismically active area, there is a high risk of destructive earthquakes in Iran; 1 in 3,000 deaths are attributable to earthquakes. [CLS] [SEP] One geophysicist has cited the lack of strict building codes as a serious concern. [CLS] [SEP]
