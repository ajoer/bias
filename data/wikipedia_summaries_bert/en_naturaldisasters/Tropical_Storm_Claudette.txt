Tropical Storm Claudette was the third-wettest tropical cyclone on record in the contiguous United States. [CLS] [SEP] Claudette caused significant flooding in eastern Texas and western Louisiana in July 1979. [CLS] [SEP] The third named storm of the 1979 Atlantic hurricane season, Claudette developed from a tropical wave located east of the Windward Islands on July 16. [CLS] [SEP] It gradually strengthened and was upgraded to a tropical storm on July 17 and crossed the northern Leeward Islands later that day. [CLS] [SEP] As it neared landfall in Puerto Rico early on July 18, upper-level winds weakened it back to a tropical depression. [CLS] [SEP] Claudette remained disorganized and the National Hurricane Center operationally reported that it degenerated back into a tropical wave after crossing Puerto Rico. [CLS] [SEP] Late on July 18, the depression struck Dominican Republic, emerged into the Caribbean Sea on the following day. [CLS] [SEP] Claudette struck western Cuba on July 21, shortly before reaching the Gulf of Mexico and "regenerating" into a tropical cyclone. [CLS] [SEP] By July 23, Claudette regained tropical storm intensity and turned northward toward the Gulf Coast of the United States. [CLS] [SEP] The storm made landfall near the Texas-Louisiana border late on July 23 as a moderately strong tropical storm. [CLS] [SEP] It weakened slowly and drifted over land, lasting until dissipation in West Virginia on July 29. [CLS] [SEP] In the Lesser Antilles, the storm brought heavy rainfall and gusty winds to several islands. [CLS] [SEP] Minor flooding occurred in Guadeloupe and Saint Croix. [CLS] [SEP] Rainfall exceeding 10 inches (250 mm) in some areas of Puerto Rico led to widespread agricultural damage, flooded homes and streets, and one fatality; losses were estimated at $750,000 (1979 USD). [CLS] [SEP] Despite its passage over Hispaniola and Cuba, impact in both regions is unknown. [CLS] [SEP] Claudette brought record-breaking rainfall to eastern Texas. [CLS] [SEP] In Alvin, 42 inches (1,100 mm) of rain fell in one day, which at one point was the record 24â€‘hour precipitation amount for any location in the United States. [CLS] [SEP] Significant coastal flooding and up to 15 inches (380 mm) of rainfall was reported in Louisiana. [CLS] [SEP] Overall, Claudette was responsible for two deaths and $400 million (1979 USD) in damage. [CLS] [SEP]
