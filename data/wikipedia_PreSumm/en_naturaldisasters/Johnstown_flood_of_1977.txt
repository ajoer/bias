[CLS] The Johnstown flood of 1977, also known as the second great flood of Johnstown and the Johnstown disaster, was a major flood which began on the night of July 19, 1977, when heavy rainfall caused widespread flash flooding in Cambria County, Pennsylvania, including the city of Johnstown and the Conemaugh Valley. [SEP] [CLS] After the Johnstown flood of 1936, the U.S. [SEP] [CLS] Army Corps of Engineers undertook a study with the aim of redesigning Johnstown's infrastructure to permanently remove any future threat of serious flooding. [SEP] [CLS] Work began in August 1938 with extensive dredging and flood control measures. [SEP] [CLS] On November 27, 1943, Colonel Gilbert Van B. [SEP] [CLS] Wilkes, Chief of the Army Corps of Engineers, Pittsburgh District, told a Johnstown audience the flood problems had been effectively solved. [SEP] [CLS] The city's residents began to feel secure that any flooding issues had been resolved and even promoted the area as "flood free" for many years. [SEP] [CLS] However, the Corps of Engineers had designed the flood control measures for protection against a standard project flood; protection to the 500-year level was not economically viable. [SEP] [CLS] In 1974, the Corps issued a report titled "The Potential for Future Flooding in the Johnstown Area", which failed to grasp the attentions of town leaders and the people of Johnstown. [SEP] [CLS] On July 19, 1977, a deluge of rain hit the area around Johnstown during the night. [SEP] [CLS] Nearly 12 inches (300 mm) of rain fell in 24 hours when a thunderstorm stalled over the area, and six dams in the area over-topped and failed. [SEP] [CLS] The largest dam to fail was the Laurel Run Dam, releasing over 101 million gallons (382,000 m3) of water that poured through the village of Tanneryville, killing 41 people. [SEP] [CLS] The combination of the other five dams released another 27 million gallons (100,000 m3), not counting the water from rains. [SEP] [CLS] Well over 128 million gallons (485,000 m3) of water from the dams alone poured down the valley, and by dawn Johnstown was inundated with six feet of water. [SEP] [CLS] The channel improvements were designed to carry 81,500 cubic feet (2,300 m3) per second, but the 1977 flood discharge was measured as 115,000 feet (3,250 m3) per second. [SEP] [CLS] Ron Shawley, executive director of Laurel Highland's Historical Village, returned to Johnstown on July 20 and stated "It was like somebody dropped an atomic bomb on Johnstown" and that "I questioned what kind of force it would take to do that."
