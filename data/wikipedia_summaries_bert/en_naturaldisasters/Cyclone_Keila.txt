Cyclonic Storm Keila (IMD designation: ARB 02, JTWC designation: 03A) was the first named storm of the 2011 North Indian Ocean cyclone season. [CLS] [SEP] A weak system for much of its duration, Keila developed in the western Arabian Sea in late October 2011, amid an area of marginally favorable conditions. [CLS] [SEP] On November 2, it briefly organized enough to be classified as a cyclonic storm, which has maximum sustained winds of at least 65 km/h (40 mph). [CLS] [SEP] Given the name Keila by the India Meteorological Department (IMD), the storm quickly moved ashore southern Oman near Salalah, and weakened while meandering over the country. [CLS] [SEP] The remnants soon after moved offshore, dissipating on November 4. [CLS] [SEP] The storm brought heavy rainfall to Oman, reaching just over 700 mm (28 in) in the mountains near Salalah. [CLS] [SEP] Moisture from the storm spread across most of the country, causing flash flooding near the capital Muscat. [CLS] [SEP] Floods from the storm killed 14 people, injured over 200, washed away hundreds of cars, and damaged many buildings. [CLS] [SEP] Two hospitals were damaged, forcing 60 patients to be evacuated elsewhere by helicopter. [CLS] [SEP] Overall damage was estimated at US$80 million (2011 USD). [CLS] [SEP] Offshore, Keila capsized a boat originating from India, killing five of the crew and leaving another nine missing; six sailors were rescued by the Omani Coast Guard. [CLS] [SEP]
