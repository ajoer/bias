Marie Skłodowska Curie ( KEWR-ee; French: [kyʁi]; Polish: [kʲiˈri]), born Maria Salomea Skłodowska (Polish: [ˈmarja salɔˈmɛa skwɔˈdɔfska]; 7 November 1867 – 4 July 1934), was a Polish and naturalized-French physicist and chemist who conducted pioneering research on radioactivity. [CLS] [SEP] As part of the Curie family legacy of five Nobel Prizes, she was the first woman to win a Nobel Prize, the first person and the only woman to win the Nobel Prize twice, and the only person to win the Nobel Prize in two scientific fields. [CLS] [SEP] She was also the first woman to become a professor at the University of Paris.She was born in Warsaw, in what was then the Kingdom of Poland, part of the Russian Empire. [CLS] [SEP] She studied at Warsaw's clandestine Flying University and began her practical scientific training in Warsaw. [CLS] [SEP] In 1891, aged 24, she followed her elder sister Bronisława to study in Paris, where she earned her higher degrees and conducted her subsequent scientific work. [CLS] [SEP] She shared the 1903 Nobel Prize in Physics with her husband Pierre Curie and physicist Henri Becquerel, for their pioneering work developing the theory of "radioactivity" (a term she coined). [CLS] [SEP] Using techniques she invented for isolating radioactive isotopes, she won the 1911 Nobel Prize in Chemistry for the discovery of two elements, polonium and radium. [CLS] [SEP] Under her direction, the world's first studies were conducted into the treatment of neoplasms using radioactive isotopes. [CLS] [SEP] She founded the Curie Institutes in Paris and in Warsaw, which remain major centres of medical research today. [CLS] [SEP] During World War I she developed mobile radiography units to provide X-ray services to field hospitals. [CLS] [SEP] While a French citizen, Marie Skłodowska Curie, who used both surnames, never lost her sense of Polish identity. [CLS] [SEP] She taught her daughters the Polish language and took them on visits to Poland. [CLS] [SEP] She named the first chemical element she discovered polonium, after her native country.Marie Curie died in 1934, aged 66, at a sanatorium in Sancellemoz (Haute-Savoie), France, of aplastic anaemia from exposure to radiation in the course of her scientific research and in the course of her radiological work at field hospitals during World War I. [CLS] [SEP] In 1995, she became the first woman to be entombed on her own merits in the Panthéon in Paris. [CLS] [SEP]
