[CLS] Katrin Apel (born 4 May 1973 in Erfurt) is a retired German biathlete. [SEP] [CLS] 1.72 m (5 ft 8 in), 61 kg (134 lb). [SEP] [CLS] Apel now resides in Gr√§fenroda, and is a member of the SV Eintracht Frankenhain club. [SEP] [CLS] Like most German winter sport athletes, Apel is a sport soldier, performing normal soldier duties but released for training and competitions. [SEP] [CLS] Apel began her career as a cross country skier; between 1990 and 1994, her best results were third place in the junior World Championships 5 km classic in 1993, and second in the relay also in the junior World Championships, in 1990. [SEP] [CLS] However, when Apel failed to qualify for the Olympics in Lillehammer in 1994, she made the decision (along with her friend and then training partner Steffi) to switch to biathlon. [SEP] [CLS] Apel began biathlon in 1994 in the European Cup, the second division to the World Cup. [SEP] [CLS] In Apel's first season in the World Cup, 1995/96, she placed 33rd, but her results improved from then on. [SEP] [CLS] In the 1998/99 season she placed 8th, in 1999/00 10th, 2000/01 12th. [SEP] [CLS] The 2001/02 season was her best when she finished the season in 5th place. [SEP] [CLS] In that season Apel placed 13th in the individual, 4th in the sprint, 4th in the pursuit, and 12th in the mass start. [SEP] [CLS] The year after she could only finish a lowly 20th place. [SEP] [CLS] She bounced back to 7th in the 2003/04 season and 8th again in 2004/05, where her best discipline was the pursuit, in which she finished 7th. [SEP] [CLS] Apel has had 18 podium finishes in the World Cup. [SEP] [CLS] Four wins, five second places and nine third places. [SEP] [CLS] All but one of her World Cup wins were in the 2001/02 season when she came 5th in the final standings. [SEP] [CLS] Also three of the four wins were in the sprint. [SEP] [CLS] Apel is a solid shooter in the prone position, averaging mid 80% over the years, but her standing shoot lets her down, only in the low 70%, though it has improved from mid 60% from a few years ago. [SEP] [CLS] Apel has four Olympic medals, two gold, one silver, and one bronze. [SEP] [CLS] Her only solo medal is a bronze in the sprint in the 1998 Winter Olympics. [SEP] [CLS] She won the other medals in relay events. [SEP] [CLS] Apel has ten World Championship medals, four gold, five silver, and one bronze. [SEP] [CLS] However only two of the medals are solo medals, one a silver won in Oslo's Holmenkollen ski festival in 2000 in the sprint, and the other, also a silver, won in the mass start in Oberhof in 2004. [SEP] [CLS] The remaining medals were won in relays. [SEP] [CLS]
