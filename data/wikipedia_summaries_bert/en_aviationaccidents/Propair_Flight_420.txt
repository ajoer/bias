[CLS] Propair Flight 420 (PRO420) was a scheduled domestic passenger flight from Dorval, Quebec to Peterborough, Ontario. [SEP] [CLS] The flight was carried out by Propair, a charter airline based in Rouyn-Noranda, Quebec, using a Fairchild Metroliner SA226. [SEP] [CLS] On 18 June 1998, the aircraft suffered an in-flight fire shortly after take-off from Dorval and the crew elected to conduct an emergency landing at Montréal–Mirabel International Airport. [SEP] [CLS] The intense heat of the fire caused a structural failure in the left wing during the landing and the aircraft crashed, killing all 11 passengers and crew on board. [SEP] [CLS] The investigation conducted by the Canadian Transportation Safety Board revealed that the left brakes of Flight 420 had overheated during take-off, causing a fire inside the wheel-well which destroyed warning systems, causing the crew to be unaware of the severity of the fire, then ruptured hydraulic pipe-lines and spreading to the left wing. [SEP] [CLS] Following the accident the Canadian TSB issued several recommendations, one of which was a recommendation to the FAA regarding the crew training and flight manual, and another being a recommendation to install an overheat warning system inside the wheel-wells of every Metroliner; before the accident warning systems were not required on such aircraft.
