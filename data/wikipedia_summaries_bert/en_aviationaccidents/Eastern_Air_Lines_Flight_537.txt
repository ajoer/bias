[CLS] Eastern Air Lines Flight 537, registration N88727, was a Douglas DC-4 aircraft en route from Boston, Massachusetts to Washington, D.C. [SEP] [CLS] via intermediate points on November 1, 1949. [SEP] [CLS] NX-26927 was a Lockheed P-38 Lightning being test-flown for acceptance by the Government of Bolivia by Erick Rios Bridoux of the Bolivian Air Force. [SEP] [CLS] The two aircraft collided in mid-air at an altitude of 300 feet about half a mile southwest of the threshold of Runway 3 at Washington National Airport, killing all 55 aboard the DC-4 and seriously injuring the pilot of the P-38. [SEP] [CLS] At the time it was the deadliest airliner incident in United States history.The tower controllers on duty that day at National testified that the P-38 had taken off on Runway 3, turned left north of The Pentagon, circled over Arlington, then returned, requesting permission to land due to engine trouble. [SEP] [CLS] The controller cleared the aircraft to join the left traffic pattern, but instead it flew south of the airport and entered a long straight-in approach at the same time Flight 537 was turning onto a shorter final. [SEP] [CLS] The controller then called Flight 537 ordering it to turn left; it began the turn, but by then the P-38, being considerably faster than a DC-4 on final, overtook the aircraft 1/2 mile southwest of the threshold of Runway 3.The DC-4 was cut in half by the left propeller of the P-38 just forward of the trailing edge of the wing. [SEP] [CLS] The aft portion of the DC-4 fell to the ground on the west bank of the Potomac River; other pieces were located in Alexandria, Virginia at the Richmond, Fredericksburg & Potomac Railroad Potomac Yard and on a highway passing near the Yard. [SEP] [CLS] The fore portion of the aircraft fell into the river, as did the P-38. [SEP] [CLS] "Many hours following the collision of an Eastern Air Lines passenger transport and a Bolivian fighter plane, the search went on today under the glare of floodlights for the nine passengers whose bodies had not yet been recovered. [SEP] [CLS] "Shocked Members of Congress, stunned by the loss of one of their own number (Dem. [SEP] [CLS] George J. [SEP] [CLS] Bates), promised a complete air safety investigation. [SEP] [CLS] The Civil Aeronautics Board said its hearings into the cause of the crash will start in a few days. [SEP] [CLS] The airline scheduled a probe of its own, as well. [SEP] [CLS] The disaster occurred as the big DC-4 transport headed into the National Airport for a landing shortly before noon, flying at about 300 feet. [SEP] [CLS] "Into the traffic pattern, calling for landing instructions, came a P-38 fighter piloted by Bolivia's top airman, Erick Rios Bridoux. [SEP] [CLS] Bridoux was testing the twin-engine craft which his government had purchased from the United States. [SEP] [CLS] An airport tower operator a bare half-mile away saw the P-38 bear down on the transport. [SEP] [CLS] He cried a radio warning to the 28-year-old Bolivian, but the P-38 kept coming. [SEP] [CLS] Then the tower frantically signalled the transport. [SEP] [CLS] The DC-4 pilot swerved the big ship from its path, but too late. [SEP] [CLS] The fighter ripped into it from above and from the side. [SEP] [CLS] The airliner split in half. [SEP] [CLS] Bodies and wreckage fell into the water and along the bank of the Potomac." Air Force Sergeant Morris J. [SEP] [CLS] Flounlacker hauled the weakly treading Bridoux out of the Potomac, just as the wounded pilot lost consciousness. [SEP] [CLS] At Alexandria Hospital, doctors found he had a broken back, crushed ribs and serious contusions.Bridoux contradicted much of the tower controllers' testimony when he spoke to Civil Aeronautics Board (CAB) investigators. [SEP] [CLS] He claimed he had taken off from Runway 36, had been in constant contact with the tower, and had been explicitly cleared to land on Runway 3 under the call sign "Bolivian 927". [SEP] [CLS] However, the testimony of both the tower personnel and a military controller listening in on the frequency from his position at Bolling Air Force Base (as well as other discrepancies in the P-38 pilot's testimony) led the CAB to discount Bridoux's version of events. [SEP] [CLS] As Bridoux spoke and understood English well, it was thought that language difficulties played no part in the accident. [SEP] [CLS] The CAB determined the primary probable causes of the accident to be the P-38 pilot's decision to land without proper clearance and his failure to exercise normal vigilance in looking out for conflicting traffic. [SEP] [CLS] The CAB also found that the tower controllers failed to exercise due vigilance in not notifying the pilots of Flight 537 earlier as to the critical traffic situation developing. [SEP] [CLS] However, the report also states that even if Flight 537 had received earlier advice with respect to the P-38's location, it might still have been too late to avoid the accident, as Bridoux's actions left Flight 537 only a few seconds in which to turn.Among the dead on Flight 537 were Congressman George J. [SEP] [CLS] Bates, New Yorker cartoonist Helen E. [SEP] [CLS] Hokinson, and former Congressman Michael J. [SEP] [CLS] Kennedy. [SEP] [CLS]
