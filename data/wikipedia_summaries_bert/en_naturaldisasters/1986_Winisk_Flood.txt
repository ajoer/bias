On May 16, 1986, the Northern Ontario community of Winisk was completely washed away. [CLS] [SEP] A spring ice jam on the Winisk River caused flood waters to reach as far as six kilometers inland, sending every structure but two into Hudson Bay. [CLS] [SEP] Many residents were caught by surprise. [CLS] [SEP] Massive boulders of ice were carried by the torrent through town, completely enveloped by the swollen river. [CLS] [SEP] Several were injured and two were killed. [CLS] [SEP] One man drowned and one woman was crushed by ice. [CLS] [SEP] Relief efforts were difficult, as few roads existed in the isolated settlement. [CLS] [SEP] Residents had no escape from the town, which was connected to the greater world only by a small helipad. [CLS] [SEP] While the flood had spared this infrastructure, it proved inadequate for effective rescue of the town's population. [CLS] [SEP] Some residents were stranded in canoes for days while rescue conducted by The Department of Indian and Northern Affairs airlifted victims between the disaster and the helipad. [CLS] [SEP] A Chinook helicopter from the Ottawa-based 450 Squadron was also at Winisk for a week bringing in supplies from Kapuskasing. [CLS] [SEP] An inquest was launched as a result of the disaster. [CLS] [SEP] Several recommendations were made, including more effective surveillance of river conditions, the implementation of an early flood warning system, emergency transportation adequate to serve its population, and a pre-planned escape route. [CLS] [SEP] Communication was also cited as an issue. [CLS] [SEP] Many northern communities did not even possess a CB radio. [CLS] [SEP] The community's isolation contributed to its neglect in flood protection. [CLS] [SEP] Winisk was abandoned, and the community was later rebuilt thirty kilometers up-river on higher ground. [CLS] [SEP] The new settlement was renamed Peawanuck, meaning "flintstone" in the Cree language. [CLS] [SEP]
