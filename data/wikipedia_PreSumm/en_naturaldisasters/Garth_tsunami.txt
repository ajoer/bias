[CLS] The Garth tsunami is a possible prehistoric tsunami in the Shetland Islands that may have occurred 5,500 years ago. [SEP] [CLS] Its origin is unknown; impact events, earthquakes, and submarine landslides similar to the Storegga Slide 8,100 years ago have been proposed. [SEP] [CLS] It generated a run-up of more than 10 metres (33 ft) in the Shetland Islands. [SEP] [CLS] The tsunami probably had an impact on coastal communities in the region; mass burials dating approximately to that time in the Shetland and Orkney Islands have been interpreted to host fatalities from the tsunami.
