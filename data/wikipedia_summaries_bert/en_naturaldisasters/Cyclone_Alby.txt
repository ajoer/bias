Severe Tropical Cyclone Alby was regarded as the most devastating tropical cyclone to impact southwestern Western Australia on record. [CLS] [SEP] Forming out of an area of low pressure on 27 March 1978, Alby steadily developed as it tracked southwestward, parallel to Western Australia. [CLS] [SEP] Between 1 and 2 April, the storm quickly intensified and attained its peak intensity as a Category 5 cyclone on the Australian cyclone intensity scale. [CLS] [SEP] After turning to the southeast, the storm underwent an extratropical transition as it neared Cape Leeuwin. [CLS] [SEP] The storm brushed the cape on 4 April, bringing hurricane-force winds, before rapidly losing its identity the following day. [CLS] [SEP] In Western Australia, the combination of Alby's fast movement and hurricane-force winds caused widespread damage. [CLS] [SEP] Along the coast, large swells flooded low-lying areas and numerous homes lost their roofs from high winds. [CLS] [SEP] Further inland, bushfires were worsened by the storm as it brought little rain, generally less than 20 mm (0.79 in) along the coast. [CLS] [SEP] These fires burned roughly 114,000 hectares (281,700 acres) and destroyed two towns. [CLS] [SEP] Five fatalities are directly attributed to Alby while two more resulted from the fires. [CLS] [SEP] The resulting damage was extensive, with monetary losses reaching A$50 million (US$45 million). [CLS] [SEP]
