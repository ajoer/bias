Hurricane Grace was a short-lived Category 2 hurricane that contributed to the formation of the powerful 1991 Perfect Storm. [CLS] [SEP] Forming on October 26, Grace initially had subtropical origins, meaning it was partially tropical and partially extratropical in nature. [CLS] [SEP] It became a tropical cyclone on October 27, and ultimately peaked with winds of 105 mph (165 km/h). [CLS] [SEP] The storm had minor effects on the island of Bermuda as it passed to the south. [CLS] [SEP] A developing extratropical storm to the north turned Grace eastward; the hurricane was eventually absorbed into the large circulation of the larger low pressure system. [CLS] [SEP] Fed by the contrast between cold air to the northwest and warm air from the remnants of Grace, this storm became a large and powerful nor'easter that caused extremely high waves and resulted in severe coastal damage along the East Coast of the United States.
