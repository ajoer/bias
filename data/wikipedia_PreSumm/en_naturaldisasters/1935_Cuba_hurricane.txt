[CLS] The 1935 Cuba hurricane was an intense and deadly tropical cyclone which caused devastation across many areas of the western Atlantic, particularly Cuba and The Bahamas, in September and October 1935. [SEP] [CLS] The fifth tropical storm and third hurricane of the 1935 Atlantic hurricane season, the storm formed from a tropical depression in the central Caribbean Sea on September 23. [SEP] [CLS] The disturbance gradually organized as it moved to the west, and strengthened to tropical storm intensity less than a day after formation and further to a hurricane by September 25. [SEP] [CLS] Subsequently, the hurricane curved northward from its initial westward motion. [SEP] [CLS] On September 27, the storm reached major hurricane intensity before making landfall near Cienfuegos, Cuba as a modern-day Category 3 hurricane the next day. [SEP] [CLS] After passing the island, the hurricane reintensified, and reached a peak intensity with a minimum barometric pressure of at least 945 mbar (hPa; 27.91 inHg) and maximum sustained winds of 140 mph (220 km/h), making it a modern-day Category 4 hurricane. [SEP] [CLS] At the same time, the tropical cyclone passed over the Bahamian island of Bimini before moving out to sea. [SEP] [CLS] As it progressed northeastward, the hurricane gradually weakened before transitioning into an extratropical storm by October 2. [SEP] [CLS] The extratropical remnants made landfall on Newfoundland shortly after before dissipating late that day. [SEP] [CLS] The hurricane caused widespread destruction in areas of the western Atlantic. [SEP] [CLS] In Jamaica, the storm's strong winds and heavy rain destroyed roughly 3 percent of the island's banana production and damaged road networks. [SEP] [CLS] Damage on the island country totaled to $2.7 million. [SEP] [CLS] In Cayman Brac, strong winds damaged infrastructure and crops, though no fatalities resulted. [SEP] [CLS] Most of the cyclone's deaths occurred in Cuba, where the storm made its first landfall. [SEP] [CLS] The hurricane's effects caused a 100 mi (160 km) wide swath of damage which cut across the country. [SEP] [CLS] Strong storm surge destroyed low-lying coastal towns, particularly in Cienfuegos, where numerous homes were destroyed and 17 people died. [SEP] [CLS] Across Cuba, the storm caused $12 million in damages and 35 deaths. [SEP] [CLS] As it crossed the island, widespread evacuation procedures occurred in southern areas of Florida, heightened due to the effects of a disastrous hurricane which struck less than a month prior. [SEP] [CLS] However, damage there was only of moderate severity. [SEP] [CLS] Passing directly over Bimini in The Bahamas, the hurricane destroyed nearly half of the island with its large storm surge. [SEP] [CLS] There, 14 people were killed. [SEP] [CLS] Further north, the storm caused slight impacts in Bermuda and Atlantic Canada, though a person drowned off of Halifax, Nova Scotia due to rough seas. [SEP] [CLS] Overall, the tropical cyclone caused 52 deaths and $14.7 million in damages, making it the third-costliest hurricane of the hurricane season. [SEP] [CLS]
