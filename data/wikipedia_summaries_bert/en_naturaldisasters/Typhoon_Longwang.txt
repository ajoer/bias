Typhoon Longwang, known in the Philippines as Typhoon Maring, was the deadliest tropical cyclone to impact China during the 2005 Pacific typhoon season. [CLS] [SEP] Longwang was first identified as a tropical depression on September 25 north of the Mariana Islands. [CLS] [SEP] Moving along a general westward track, the system quickly intensified and reached typhoon status on September 27. [CLS] [SEP] After reaching Category 4-equivalent intensity on the Saffirâ€“Simpson hurricane scale, adverse atmospheric conditions along with internal structural changes resulted in temporary weakening. [CLS] [SEP] The structural change culminated in Longwang becoming an annular typhoon and prompted re-intensification. [CLS] [SEP] The storm attained peak strength with winds of 175 km/h (110 mph) and a pressure of 930 mbar (hPa; 27.46 inHg) on October 1 as it approached Taiwan. [CLS] [SEP] Interaction with the mountainous terrain of the island and further structural changes caused some weakening before the typhoon made landfall near Hualien City early on October 2. [CLS] [SEP] Crossing the island in six hours, Longwang emerged over the Taiwan Strait before moving onshore again later that day, this time in Fujian Province, China as a minimal typhoon. [CLS] [SEP] Once over mainland China, the storm quickly weakened and ultimately dissipated late on October 3. [CLS] [SEP] Prior to the storm's arrival, officials in Taiwan activated all emergency operations centers and urged residents to take serious precautions. [CLS] [SEP] The storm brought record-breaking winds, peaking at 234 km/h (145 mph) in Hualien City, and torrential rains. [CLS] [SEP] Despite the intensity of the storm, damage was relatively limited there. [CLS] [SEP] Two people lost their lives, 73 were injured, and damage reached NT$570 million (US$17.7 million). [CLS] [SEP] Large-scale evacuations took place in mainland China, with 684,860 people relocating. [CLS] [SEP] Losses were extensive in Fujian Province where 1-in-100 year rains caused disastrous flooding in Fuzhou, killing 62 people. [CLS] [SEP] In Minhou County, 85 paramilitary police perished when a landslide destroyed their barracks. [CLS] [SEP] Throughout China, 147 people were killed and damage amounted to 7.81 billion RMB (US$944.6 million). [CLS] [SEP] Due to the severe damage, the name Longwang was later retired.
