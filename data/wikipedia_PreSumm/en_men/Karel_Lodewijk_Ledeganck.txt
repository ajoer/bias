[CLS] Karel Lodewijk Ledeganck (Eeklo, 9 November 1805 â€“ Ghent, 19 March 1847) was a Flemish writer. [SEP] [CLS] He was of humble origin, but became extraordinary Professor at the University of Ghent. [SEP] [CLS] He started his career as a clerk, then became a judge, and school inspector before he came to teach at the university. [SEP] [CLS] In 1836, he published the poem Het klavier ("the keyboard"), but he made his actual debut in 1838, with the poems in Bloemen mijner lente ("flowers of my spring"). [SEP] [CLS] His initial work was strongly influenced by the English and French Romantic movement, and more specifically by Byron and Lamartine, in contrast to his later poems, which were rather pessimistic. [SEP] [CLS] With his Drie zustersteden of 1843, dedicated to the cities of Ghent, Bruges and Antwerp, which was called the poetic gospel of the Flemish movement, he achieved a breakthrough. [SEP] [CLS] In this trilogy he showed himself to be the best Flemish poet of his generation. [SEP] [CLS] In his, now somewhat exalted or melancholic, style he proclaimed his love for the Flemish people and his belief in their future. [SEP] [CLS] The Karel Lodewijk Ledeganckstraat in Ghent was named after him. [SEP] [CLS] The Ledeganck Campus of sciences of Ghent University is located here. [SEP] [CLS]
