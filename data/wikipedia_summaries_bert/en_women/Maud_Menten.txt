[CLS] Maud Leonora Menten (March 20, 1879 – July 17, 1960) was a Canadian bio-medical and medical researcher who made significant contributions to enzyme kinetics and histochemistry. [SEP] [CLS] She is primarily known for her work with Leonor Michaelis on enzyme kinetics and co-authored Michaelis–Menten equation in 1913. [SEP] [CLS] Maud Menten was born in Port Lambton, Ontario and studied medicine at the University of Toronto (B.A. [SEP] [CLS] 1904, M.B. [SEP] [CLS] 1907, M.D. [SEP] [CLS] 1911, Ph.D., 1916). [SEP] [CLS] She was among the first women in Canada to earn a medical doctorate. [SEP] [CLS] She completed her thesis work at University of Chicago. [SEP] [CLS] At that time women were not allowed to do research in Canada, so she decided to do research in other countries such as the United States and Germany. [SEP] [CLS] In 1912 she moved to Berlin where she worked with Leonor Michaelis and co-authored their paper in Biochemische Zeitschrift which showed that the rate of an enzyme-catalyzed reaction is proportional to the amount of the enzyme-substrate complex. [SEP] [CLS] This relationship between reaction rate and enzyme–substrate concentration is known as the Michaelis–Menten equation. [SEP] [CLS] After studying with Michaelis in Germany she entered graduate school at the University of Chicago where she obtained her PhD in 1916. [SEP] [CLS] Her dissertation was titled "The Alkalinity of the Blood in Malignancy and Other Pathological Conditions; Together with Observations on the Relation of the Alkalinity of the Blood to Barometric Pressure". [SEP] [CLS] Menten worked at the University of Pittsburgh (1923–1950), becoming Assistant Professor and then Associate Professor in the School of Medicine and head of pathology at the Children's Hospital of Pittsburgh. [SEP] [CLS] Her final promotion to full Professor, in 1948, was at the age of 69 in the last year of her career. [SEP] [CLS] Her final academic post was as a research fellow at the British Columbia Medical Research Institute. [SEP] [CLS]
