[CLS] Extremely Severe Cyclonic Storm Fani () was the strongest tropical cyclone to strike the Indian state of Odisha since the 1999 Odisha cyclone. [SEP] [CLS] The second named storm and the first severe cyclonic storm of the 2019 North Indian Ocean cyclone season, Fani originated from a tropical depression that formed west of Sumatra in the Indian Ocean on 26 April. [SEP] [CLS] Vertical wind shear at first hindered the storm's development, but conditions became more favorable for Fani on 30 April. [SEP] [CLS] Fani rapidly intensified into an extremely severe cyclonic storm and reached its peak intensity on 2 May with 1-minute sustained winds equivalent to a high-end Category 4 major hurricane. [SEP] [CLS] Fani weakened before making its landfall, and its convective structure rapidly degraded thereafter, degenerating into a remnant low on 4 May, and dissipating on the next day. [SEP] [CLS] Prior to Fani's landfall, authorities in India and Bangladesh moved at least a million people each from areas within Fani's projected path onto higher ground, and into cyclone shelters, which is thought to have reduced the resultant death toll and casualties. [SEP] [CLS] Fani killed at least 89 people in eastern India and Bangladesh and caused about US$8.1 billion in damages in both India and Bangladesh, mostly in Odisha, in India. [SEP] [CLS]
