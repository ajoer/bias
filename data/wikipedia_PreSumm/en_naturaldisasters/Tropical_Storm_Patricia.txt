[CLS] Hurricane Patricia was the most intense tropical cyclone on record worldwide in terms of wind speed and the second-most intense on record worldwide in terms of pressure, behind Typhoon Tip in 1979, with a minimum atmospheric pressure of 872 mbar (hPa; 25.75 inHg). [SEP] [CLS] Originating from a sprawling disturbance near the Gulf of Tehuantepec, south of Mexico, in mid-October 2015, Patricia was first classified a tropical depression on October 20. [SEP] [CLS] Initial development was slow, with only modest strengthening within the first day of its classification. [SEP] [CLS] The system later became a tropical storm and was named Patricia, the twenty-fourth named storm of the annual hurricane season. [SEP] [CLS] Exceptionally favorable environmental conditions fueled explosive intensification on October 22. [SEP] [CLS] A well-defined eye developed within an intense central dense overcast and Patricia grew from a tropical storm to a Category 5 hurricane in just 24 hoursâ€”a near-record pace. [SEP] [CLS] On October 23, the hurricane achieved its record peak intensity with maximum sustained winds of 215 mph (345 km/h). [SEP] [CLS] This made it the most intense tropical cyclone on record in the Western Hemisphere and the strongest globally in terms of one-minute maximum sustained winds. [SEP] [CLS] Late on October 23, dramatic weakening ensued and Patricia made landfall near Cuixmala, Jalisco, with winds of 150 mph (240 km/h). [SEP] [CLS] This made it the strongest landfalling hurricane on record along the Pacific coast of Mexico. [SEP] [CLS] Patricia continued to weaken extremely quickly, faster than it had intensified, as it interacted with the mountainous terrain of Mexico. [SEP] [CLS] Within 24 hours of moving ashore, Patricia weakened into a tropical depression and dissipated soon thereafter, late on October 24. [SEP] [CLS] The precursor to Patricia produced widespread flooding rains in Central America. [SEP] [CLS] Hundreds of thousands of people were directly affected by the storm, mostly in Guatemala. [SEP] [CLS] At least six fatalities were attributed to the event: four in El Salvador, one in Guatemala, and one in Nicaragua. [SEP] [CLS] Torrential rains extended into southeastern Mexico, with areas of Quintana Roo and Veracruz reporting accumulations in excess of 19.7 in (500 mm). [SEP] [CLS] Damage in Chetumal reached MX$1.4 billion (US$85.3 million).As a tropical cyclone, Patricia's effects in Mexico were tremendous; however, the affected areas were predominantly rural, mitigating a potential large-scale disaster. [SEP] [CLS] Violent winds tore roofs from structures and stripped coastal areas of their vegetation. [SEP] [CLS] Preliminary assessments indicated hundreds of homes to be destroyed; seven fatalities were linked to the hurricane directly or indirectly, including one during evacuations. [SEP] [CLS] Total damage from Patricia was estimated to be at least $462.8 million (2015 USD); the damage in Mexico alone was estimated to be in excess of MX$5.4 billion (US$325 million), with agriculture and infrastructure comprising the majority of losses. [SEP] [CLS] Flooding partially associated with remnant moisture from Patricia inflicted US$52.5 million in damage across Southern Texas. [SEP] [CLS]
