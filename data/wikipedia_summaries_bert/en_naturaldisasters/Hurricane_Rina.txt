[CLS] Hurricane Rina was a powerful and slow-moving tropical cyclone that caused minor impacts in the northwestern Caribbean Sea in late October 2011. [SEP] [CLS] The seventeenth named storm, seventh hurricane, and fourth major hurricane of the annual hurricane season, Rina developed from a tropical wave in the western Caribbean on October 23. [SEP] [CLS] The depression quickly intensified, and was upgraded to Tropical Storm Rina early on the following day. [SEP] [CLS] Further strengthening ensued as it tracked west-northwestward, with Rina becoming a hurricane on October 24. [SEP] [CLS] The hurricane eventually peaked as a Category 3 hurricane while it moved generally westward on October 25. [SEP] [CLS] However, on October 26, Rina weakened substantially and was downgraded to a Category 1 hurricane. [SEP] [CLS] Further weakening occurred, with Rina falling to tropical storm intensity on October 27. [SEP] [CLS] Rina then made landfall in northern Quintana Roo early the next day. [SEP] [CLS] The cyclone degenerated into a remnant low later on October 28 after emerging into the Yucatán Channel. [SEP] [CLS] The low dissipated near the western tip of Cuba on October 29. [SEP] [CLS] Several tropical cyclone warnings and watches were issued in anticipation of the storm in Belize, Honduras, and Mexico. [SEP] [CLS] Carnival Cruise Lines changed eight of their ships' itineraries to avoid the developing cyclone. [SEP] [CLS] In Mexico, hundreds were ordered to evacuate from Punta Allen. [SEP] [CLS] Authorities set up 50 emergency shelters in Cancún. [SEP] [CLS] However, because the storm weakened significantly prior to landfall, only minor impact occurred in Mexico, mainly limited to flooding in some low-lying areas and downed trees and power lines. [SEP] [CLS] Convergence caused by a cold front and moisture from Rina resulted in heavy rainfall over portions of southeastern Florida. [SEP] [CLS] A number of streets were inundated and dozens of homes received water damage in Broward, Miami-Dade, and Palm Beach counties. [SEP] [CLS] In Broward County alone, about 160 homes were flooded. [SEP] [CLS] Farther north, two tornadoes were spawned in the vicinity of Hobe Sound, one of which damaged 42 mobile homes, 2 vehicles, and a number of trees. [SEP] [CLS] Throughout Florida, damage reached approximately $2.3 million (2011 USD). [SEP] [CLS]
