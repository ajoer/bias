Hurricane Esther was the first large tropical cyclone to be discovered by satellite imagery. [CLS] [SEP] The fifth tropical cyclone, named storm, and hurricane of the 1961 Atlantic hurricane season, Esther developed from an area of disturbed weather hundreds of miles west-southwest of the southernmost Cape Verde Islands on September 10. [CLS] [SEP] Moving northwestward, the depression strengthened into Tropical Storm Esther on September 11, before reaching hurricane intensity on the following day. [CLS] [SEP] Early on September 13, Esther curved westward and deepened into a major hurricane. [CLS] [SEP] The storm remained a Category 3 hurricane for about four days and gradually moved in a west-northwestward direction. [CLS] [SEP] Late on September 17, Esther strengthened into a Category 5 hurricane with sustained winds of 160 mph (260 km/h) on September 18. [CLS] [SEP] The storm curved north-northeastward on September 19, while offshore of North Carolina. [CLS] [SEP] Esther began to weaken while approaching New England and fell to Category 3 intensity on September 21. [CLS] [SEP] The storm turned eastward early on the following day, and rapidly weakened to a tropical storm. [CLS] [SEP] Esther then executed a large cyclonic loop, until curving northward on September 25. [CLS] [SEP] Early on the following day, Esther struck Cape Cod, hours before emerging into the Gulf of Maine. [CLS] [SEP] Later on September 26, the storm made landfall in southeastern Maine, before weakening to a tropical depression and becoming extratropical over southeastern Quebec. [CLS] [SEP] The remnants persisted for about 12 hours, before dissipating early on September 27. [CLS] [SEP] Between North Carolina and New Jersey, effects were primarily limited to strong winds and minor beach erosion and coastal flooding due to storm surge. [CLS] [SEP] In New York, strong winds led to severe crop losses and over 300,000 power outages. [CLS] [SEP] High tides caused coastal flooding and damage to a number of pleasure boats. [CLS] [SEP] Similar impact was reported in Massachusetts. [CLS] [SEP] Additionally, some areas observed more than 8 inches (203 mm) of rainfall, flooding basements, low-lying roads, and underpasses. [CLS] [SEP] Overall, damage was minor, totaling about $6 million (1961 USD). [CLS] [SEP] There were also seven deaths reported when a United States Navy P5M aircraft crashed about 120 miles (190 km) north of Bermuda. [CLS] [SEP]
