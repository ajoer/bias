Umar (), also spelled Omar (; Arabic: عمر بن الخطاب‎ ʻUmar ibn al-Khaṭṭāb [ˈʕomɑr-, ˈʕʊmɑr ɪbn alxɑtˤˈtˤɑːb], "Umar, Son of Al-Khattab"; c. [CLS] [SEP] 584 CE – 3 November 644 CE), was one of the most powerful and influential Muslim caliphs in history. [CLS] [SEP] He was a senior companion of the Islamic prophet Muhammad. [CLS] [SEP] He succeeded Abu Bakr (632–634) as the second caliph of the Rashidun Caliphate on 23 August 634. [CLS] [SEP] He was an expert Muslim jurist known for his pious and just nature, which earned him the epithet Al-Farooq ("the one who distinguishes (between right and wrong)"). [CLS] [SEP] He is sometimes referred to as Umar I by historians of Islam, since a later Umayyad caliph, Umar II, also bore that name. [CLS] [SEP] Under Umar, the caliphate expanded at an unprecedented rate, ruling the Sasanian Empire and more than two-thirds of the Byzantine Empire. [CLS] [SEP] His attacks against the Sasanian Empire resulted in the conquest of Persia in less than two years (642–644). [CLS] [SEP] According to Jewish tradition, Umar set aside the Christian ban on Jews and allowed them into Jerusalem and to worship. [CLS] [SEP] Umar was eventually killed by the Persian Piruz Nahavandi (known as ’Abū Lu’lu’ah in Arabic) in 644 CE. [CLS] [SEP] Umar is revered in the Sunni tradition as a great ruler and paragon of Islamic virtues, and some hadiths identify him as the second greatest of the Sahaba after Abu Bakr. [CLS] [SEP] He is viewed negatively in the Shia tradition. [CLS] [SEP]
