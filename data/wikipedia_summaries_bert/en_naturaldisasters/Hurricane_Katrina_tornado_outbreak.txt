[CLS] Accompanying Hurricane Katrina's catastrophic coastal impacts was a moderate tornado outbreak spawned by the cyclone's outer bands. [SEP] [CLS] The event spanned August 26–31, 2005, with 57 tornadoes touching down across 8 states. [SEP] [CLS] One person died and numerous communities suffered damage of varying degrees from central Mississippi to Pennsylvania, with Georgia sustaining record monetary damage for the month of August. [SEP] [CLS] Due to extreme devastation in coastal areas of Louisiana and Mississippi, multiple tornadoes may have been overlooked—overshadowed by the effects of storm surge and large-scale wind—and thus the full extent of the hurricane's tornado outbreak is uncertain. [SEP] [CLS] Furthermore, an indeterminate number of waterspouts likely formed throughout the life cycle of Katrina.The outbreak began with an isolated F2 over the Florida Keys on August 26; no tornadoes were recorded the following day as the storm traversed the Gulf of Mexico. [SEP] [CLS] Four weak tornadoes were observed on August 28 as the hurricane approached land, each causing little damage. [SEP] [CLS] Coincident with Katrina's landfall, activity began in earnest on August 29 with numerous tornadoes touching down across Gulf Coast states. [SEP] [CLS] Georgia suffered the greatest impact on this day, with multiple F1 and F2 tornadoes causing significant damage; one person died in Carroll County, marking the first known instance of a tornado-related death in the state during August. [SEP] [CLS] A record 18 tornadoes touched down across Georgia on August 29, far exceeding the previous daily record of just 2 tornadoes for the month throughout the state. [SEP] [CLS] Activity diminished over the subsequent two days as the former hurricane moved northward. [SEP] [CLS] Several more tornadoes touched down across the Mid-Atlantic states before the cessation of the outbreak just after midnight local time on August 31. [SEP] [CLS]
