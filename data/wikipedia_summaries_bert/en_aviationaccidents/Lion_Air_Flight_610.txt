Lion Air Flight 610 was a scheduled domestic flight operated by the Indonesian airline Lion Air from Soekarnoâ€“Hatta International Airport in Jakarta to Depati Amir Airport in Pangkal Pinang. [CLS] [SEP] On 29 October 2018, the Boeing 737 MAX operating the route crashed into the Java Sea 13 minutes after takeoff, killing all 189 passengers and crew. [CLS] [SEP] It was the first major accident involving the new Boeing 737 MAX series of aircraft, introduced in 2017, and the deadliest involving the Boeing 737 series, surpassing Air India Express Flight 812 in 2010. [CLS] [SEP] It is the deadliest accident in Lion Air's 18-year history, surpassing the 2004 crash in Surakarta that killed 25, and the second deadliest aircraft accident in Indonesia behind Garuda Indonesia Flight 152. [CLS] [SEP] The Indonesian government deployed a search and rescue operation which found debris early the same morning and recovered human remains from a 280 km (150 nmi) wide area. [CLS] [SEP] The first victim was identified two days after the crash. [CLS] [SEP] The flight data recorder was located on 1 November and recovered for analysis. [CLS] [SEP] One member of the volunteer rescue team died during recovery operations. [CLS] [SEP] The cockpit voice recorder was found on 14 January 2019.Preliminary investigations revealed serious flight control problems that traumatized passengers and crew on the aircraft's previous flight, as well as signs of Angle of attack (AoA) sensor and other instrument failures on that and previous flights, tied to a design flaw involving the Maneuvering Characteristics Augmentation System (MCAS) of the 737 MAX series. [CLS] [SEP] As a result, the United States Federal Aviation Administration and Boeing issued warnings and training advisories to all operators of the 737 MAX series to avoid letting the MCAS cause an abrupt dive similar to the Lion Air flight. [CLS] [SEP] These advisories were not fully implemented, however, and the design issues are suspected to be involved in the Ethiopian Airlines Flight 302 crash on 10 March 2019, prompting a worldwide grounding of all 737 MAX aircraft. [CLS] [SEP] A summary of the October 2019 final report says that "MCAS was the primary cause of the crash, a faulty sensor, inadequate maintenance, poor pilot training and a failure to heed previous problems with the same aircraft were all contributing factors."
