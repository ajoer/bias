[CLS] Tropical Storm Omeka was the latest forming Eastern Pacific named storm since reliable records began in the 1960s. [SEP] [CLS] The storm was part of the 2010 Pacific typhoon and hurricane season. [SEP] [CLS] On December 18, 2010, the Central Pacific Hurricane Center (CPHC) began monitoring a subtropical cyclone near the International Dateline for possible tropical cyclogenesis. [SEP] [CLS] Over the following two days, the system tracked southwestward, entering the Western Pacific basin. [SEP] [CLS] It then began to transition into a tropical cyclone. [SEP] [CLS] Shortly before crossing the dateline on December 20, the CPHC assessed the system to have become a tropical storm. [SEP] [CLS] The storm was assigned the name Omeka several hours later as it moved into the CPHC's area of responsibility – which is from 140°W to the International Dateline. [SEP] [CLS] Upon doing so, Omeka attained its peak intensity with winds of 60 mph (100 km/h). [SEP] [CLS] Later on December 20, wind shear in the region increased, causing the system to weaken. [SEP] [CLS] By December 21, the center of Omeka was devoid of convection and dissipated on the next day. [SEP] [CLS] Omeka brushed Lisianski Island with no damage. [SEP] [CLS]
