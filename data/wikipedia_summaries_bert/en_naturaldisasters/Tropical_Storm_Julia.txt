Tropical Storm Julia was a weak tropical cyclone that caused minor damage across the Eastern United States in September 2016. [CLS] [SEP] The tenth named storm of the 2016 Atlantic hurricane season, Julia developed from a tropical wave near the coast of east-central Florida on September 13. [CLS] [SEP] Initially a tropical depression, the system soon made landfall near Jensen Beach. [CLS] [SEP] Despite moving inland, the cyclone intensified into a tropical storm, shortly before strengthening further to reach maximum sustained winds of 50 mph (85 km/h). [CLS] [SEP] Julia then drifted north-northwestward and then northeastward, moving offshore the Southeastern United States on September 14. [CLS] [SEP] A cyclonic loop occurred as strong westerly air developed in the region, with the shear causing fluctuations in intensity. [CLS] [SEP] By September 19, Julia degenerated into a remnant low, which later transitioned into an extratropical cyclone and moved inland over North Carolina before dissipating on September 21. [CLS] [SEP] Due to Julia's asymmetrical structure and fairly weak intensity, the storm caused generally minor wind and flooding damage in Florida, Georgia, and South Carolina. [CLS] [SEP] However, parts of North Carolina received as much as 12 in (300 mm) of rain, while as much as 18 in (460 mm) fell in the Hampton Roads area of Virginia. [CLS] [SEP] One million gallons of sewage from Elizabeth City flowed into the Pasquotank River and Charles Creek. [CLS] [SEP] The Cashie River in Windsor, reached 15 ft (4.6 m), 2 ft (0.6 m) above flood stage. [CLS] [SEP] Several businesses and approximately 60 homes in the town were destroyed. [CLS] [SEP] In Bertie County alone, a total of 72 people had to be rescued from their homes, while 61 others were evacuated from nursing homes. [CLS] [SEP] Schools were closed in Bertie, Currituck and Hertford counties for at least two days. [CLS] [SEP] In Virginia, flooding overwhelmed the sewer system in Chesapeake and inundated numerous roads in the southeastern portion of the state. [CLS] [SEP] Damage from the storm amounted to $6.13 million. [CLS] [SEP]
