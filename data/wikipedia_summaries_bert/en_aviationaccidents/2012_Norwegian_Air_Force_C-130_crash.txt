[CLS] On 15 March 2012, a C-130J Super Hercules military transport aircraft of the Royal Norwegian Air Force (Norwegian: Luftforsvaret) crashed into the western face of Mount Kebnekaise near Kiruna, Sweden. [SEP] [CLS] All five people on board were killed.Swedish air traffic control had given the crew a clearance that placed them outside controlled airspace and below the altitude of the surrounding terrain, a circumstance that went unnoticed to the crew. [SEP] [CLS] Contributing to the accident was the pilots' decision to configure the aircraft in tactical mode, despite not conducting a tactical operation. [SEP] [CLS] In this mode, the aircraft's terrain warning system was inhibited, meaning the pilots were not alerted to the risk of collision with terrain. [SEP] [CLS]
