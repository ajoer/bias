A mid-air collision is an aviation accident in which two or more aircraft come into unplanned contact during flight. [CLS] [SEP] Owing to the relatively high velocities involved and the likelihood of subsequent impact with the ground or sea, very severe damage or the total destruction of at least one of the aircraft usually results. [CLS] [SEP] The potential for a mid-air collision is increased by miscommunication, mistrust, error in navigation, deviations from flight plans, lack of situational awareness and the lack of collision-avoidance systems. [CLS] [SEP] Although a rare occurrence in general due to the vastness of open space available, collisions often happen near or at airports, where large volumes of aircraft are spaced more closely than in general flight.
