The Hekla 3 eruption (H-3) circa 1000 BC is considered the most severe eruption of Hekla during the Holocene. [CLS] [SEP] It threw about 7.3 km3 of volcanic rock into the atmosphere, placing its Volcanic Explosivity Index (VEI) at 5. [CLS] [SEP] This would have cooled temperatures in the Northern Hemisphere for several years afterwards. [CLS] [SEP] An eighteen-year span of global cooling that is recorded in Irish bog oaks has been attributed to H-3. [CLS] [SEP] The eruption is detectable in Greenland ice-cores, the bristlecone pine sequence, and the Irish oak sequence of extremely narrow growth rings. [CLS] [SEP] Andy Baker's team of researchers dated it to 1021 BC ±130.A "high chronology" (earlier) interpretation of the above results is preferred by Baker, based also on growth of stalagmites. [CLS] [SEP] In Sutherland, northwest Scotland, a spurt of four years of doubled annual luminescent growth banding of calcite in a stalagmite is datable to 1135 BC ±130.A rival, "low-chronology" interpretation of the eruption has been made by Andrew Dugmore: 2879 BP (929 BC ±34). [CLS] [SEP] In 1999, Dugmore suggested a non-volcanic explanation for the Scottish results. [CLS] [SEP] In 2000 skepticism concerning conclusions about connecting Hekla 3 and Hekla 4 (probably 2310 BC ±20) with paleoenvironmental events and archaeologically attested abandonment of settlement sites in northern Scotland was expressed by John P. [CLS] [SEP] Grattan and David D. [CLS] [SEP] Gilbertson. [CLS] [SEP] Some Egyptologists have firmly dated the eruption to 1159 BC, and blamed it for famines under Ramesses III during the wider Bronze Age collapse. [CLS] [SEP] Dugmore has rebutted this dating. [CLS] [SEP] Other scholars have held off on this dispute, preferring the neutral and vague "3000 BP". [CLS] [SEP]
