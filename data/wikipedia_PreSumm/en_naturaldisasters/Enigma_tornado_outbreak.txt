[CLS] The 1884 Enigma outbreak is thought to be among the largest and most widespread tornado outbreaks in American history, striking on February 19–20, 1884. [SEP] [CLS] As the precise number of tornadoes as well as fatalities incurred during the outbreak are unknown, the nickname "Enigma outbreak" has come to be associated with the storm. [SEP] [CLS] Nonetheless, an inspection of newspaper reports and governmental studies published in the aftermath reveals tornadoes (or more likely — long-track tornado families) striking Alabama, Georgia, Illinois, Indiana, Kentucky, Mississippi, North Carolina, South Carolina, Tennessee and Virginia, with an estimation of at least 50 tornadoes. [SEP] [CLS] Some events counted as tornadoes in initial studies such as those by John Park Finley were likely downbursts, especially in northern and northeastern portions of the outbreak.The majority of reported tornado activity was seen across Alabama, Georgia, South Carolina and North Carolina, which were all struck severely by multiple waves of tornado families. [SEP] [CLS] In the Southeast, the outbreak began during the late morning in Mississippi, preceded by severe thunderstorms in Louisiana. [SEP] [CLS] Shortly thereafter, the outbreak widened and intensified, progressing from Alabama to Virginia between noon and midnight.Elsewhere, wind damage, flash flood (with homes swept away by water in Louisville, Kentucky, New Albany, Indiana, and Jeffersonville, Indiana and other towns along the Ohio River) and derecho-like effects in the Ohio Valley were also reported in published accounts of the outbreak. [SEP] [CLS] Blizzard conditions occurred in the eastern Midwest.According to an article appearing in the Statesville (NC) Landmark three days later, the damage tally in Georgia alone was estimated to be $1 million, in 1884 dollars. [SEP] [CLS] Tabulations from 1884 estimate a total of $3–4 million in tornado damage (with an unknown amount of flood and other damage), with 10,000 structures destroyed. [SEP] [CLS]
