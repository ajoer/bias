Hurricane Julia was the easternmost Category 4 hurricane recorded in the Atlantic basin since reliable satellite observations became available. [CLS] [SEP] The twelfth tropical cyclone, fifth hurricane and fourth major hurricane of the 2010 Atlantic hurricane season, Julia rapidly developed on September 12 from a tropical wave near Cape Verde. [CLS] [SEP] Passing near the islands, the system quickly organized into Tropical Storm Julia the next day. [CLS] [SEP] On September 14, Julia attained hurricane status and subsequently entered a trend of rapid intensification; the storm strengthened from a minimal hurricane to a low-end Category 4 in only 24 hours. [CLS] [SEP] After peaking in intensity, further development was impeded as interaction with nearby Hurricane Igor began to occur; the storm was downgraded to a tropical storm by September 18. [CLS] [SEP] It subsequently moved into a region of unfavorable conditions, heading toward lower sea surface temperatures. [CLS] [SEP] Correspondingly, Julia entered an extratropical transition on September 20, and advisories on the storm were discontinued by that time. [CLS] [SEP] As Julia never posed any significant threat to land, damage related to the storm was minimal. [CLS] [SEP] Trace amounts of rain reportedly fell across the Cape Verde islands, causing locally light flooding and minor inconveniences. [CLS] [SEP] Gusts battering the territory peaked at 30 mph (48 km/h), resulting in some wind damage to crops. [CLS] [SEP] In addition, these winds produced rough sea conditions, and high waves posed few threats along coastlines. [CLS] [SEP]
