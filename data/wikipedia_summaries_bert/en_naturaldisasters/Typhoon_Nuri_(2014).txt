Typhoon Nuri, known in the Philippines as Typhoon Paeng, was the third most intense tropical cyclone worldwide in 2014. [CLS] [SEP] Nuri developed into a tropical storm and received the name Paeng from the PAGASA on October 31, before it intensified into a typhoon on the next day. [CLS] [SEP] Under excellent conditions, especially the synoptic scale outflow, Nuri underwent rapid deepening and reached its peak intensity on November 2, forming a round eye in a symmetric Central dense overcast (CDO). [CLS] [SEP] Having maintained the impressive structure for over one day, the typhoon began to weaken on November 4, with a cloud-filled eye.Because of increasing vertical wind shear from the mid-latitude westerlies, Nuri lost the eye on November 5, and deep convection continued to diminish. [CLS] [SEP] The storm accelerated northeastward and completely became extratropical on November 6. [CLS] [SEP] However, on November 7, Nuri's circulation split, and the new center absorbed the storm.
