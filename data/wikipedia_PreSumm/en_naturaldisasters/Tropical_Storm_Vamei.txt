[CLS] Tropical Storm Vamei (also known as Typhoon Vamei) was a Pacific tropical cyclone that formed closer to the equator than any other tropical cyclone on record. [SEP] [CLS] The last storm of the 2001 Pacific typhoon season, Vamei developed on December 26 at 1.4Â° N in the South China Sea. [SEP] [CLS] It strengthened quickly and made landfall along extreme southeastern Peninsular Malaysia. [SEP] [CLS] Vamei rapidly weakened into a remnant low over Sumatra on December 28, and the remnants eventually re-organized in the North Indian Ocean. [SEP] [CLS] Afterward, the storm encountered strong wind shear once again, and dissipated on January 1, 2002. [SEP] [CLS] Though Vamei was officially designated as a tropical storm, its intensity is disputed; some agencies classify it as a typhoon, based on sustained winds of 120 km/h (75 mph) and the appearance of an eye. [SEP] [CLS] The storm brought flooding and landslides to eastern Peninsular Malaysia, causing $3.6 million in damage (2001 USD, $5.2 million 2020 USD) and five deaths. [SEP] [CLS]
