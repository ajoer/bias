[CLS] The Red River flood of 1997 was a major flood that occurred in April and May 1997 along the Red River of the North in Minnesota, North Dakota, and Southern Manitoba. [SEP] [CLS] It was the most severe flood of the river since 1826. [SEP] [CLS] The flood reached throughout the Red River Valley, affecting the cities of Fargo and Winnipeg, but none so greatly as Grand Forks and East Grand Forks, where floodwaters reached more than 3 miles (4.8 km) inland. [SEP] [CLS] They inundated virtually everything in the twin communities. [SEP] [CLS] Total damages for the Red River region were US$3.5 billion. [SEP] [CLS] The flood was the result of abundant snowfall and extreme temperatures. [SEP] [CLS] Flooding in Manitoba resulted in over $500 million in damages. [SEP] [CLS] The Red River Floodway, an artificial waterway completed in 1968 and known as "Duff's Ditch", diverted some floodwaters around Winnipeg, saving it from flooding. [SEP] [CLS] As a result of the 1997 flood and its extensive property losses, the United States and state governments made additional improvements to the flood protection system in North Dakota and Minnesota. [SEP] [CLS] They converted former areas of development in the floodplain on both sides of the river to the Greater Grand Forks Greenway, providing year-round recreation areas for residents as well as a natural way to absorb floodwaters. [SEP] [CLS] A dike system was built to protect the twin Forks cities. [SEP] [CLS] In Grand Forks, thousands of people, including Air Force personnel from Grand Forks Air Force Base, tried to prepare for the 1997 flood by building sandbag dikes. [SEP] [CLS] These dikes were constructed based on a 49-foot estimate of flooding set by the National Weather Service. [SEP] [CLS] The river crested at 54 feet in Grand Forks. [SEP] [CLS] Grand Forks mayor Pat Owens had to order the evacuation of more than 50,000 people, most of the population of the city, as a huge area was flooded. [SEP] [CLS] A large fire started in Grand Forks, engulfing eleven buildings and sixty apartment units before being extinguished. [SEP] [CLS] Those affected by the flood in the U.S. [SEP] [CLS] received donations from across the nation, along with billions of dollars in federal aid. [SEP] [CLS] City officials and flood-forecasters were criticized for the difference in estimates and actual flood levels. [SEP] [CLS] In the aftermath, the Federal Emergency Management Agency (FEMA) worked with the cities of Grand Forks and East Grand Forks to clear residential and business development from a large area of floodplain, because of the certainty of future regional floods. [SEP] [CLS] A system of new dikes was built beyond this on both sides of the river to prevent damage to the cities from future floods. [SEP] [CLS] They also redeveloped the floodplain along the river as the Greater Grand Forks Greenway, including several parks, a Minnesota state campground recreation area, and a 20-mile biking and walking trail.
