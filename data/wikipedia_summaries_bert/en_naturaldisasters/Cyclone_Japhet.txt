Cyclone Japhet was a damaging tropical cyclone that affected southeast Africa in March 2003. [CLS] [SEP] It developed on February 25 near the southwest coast of Madagascar, and initially moved to the northwest before turning to the southwest. [CLS] [SEP] With favorable conditions for development, Japhet quickly intensified in the Mozambique Channel, reaching maximum winds of 175 km/h (109 mph) , sustained over 10 minutes. [CLS] [SEP] After stalling briefly, the cyclone turned to the northwest, weakening slightly before striking Mozambique just south of Vilankulo on March 2. [CLS] [SEP] Japhet slowly weakened while progressing inland, dissipating over Zambia on March 6. [CLS] [SEP] Along its path, Japhet dropped heavy rainfall that caused widespread river flooding. [CLS] [SEP] The rains occurred after an extended drought, although excessive precipitation caused heavy crop damage, notably around where the storm moved ashore. [CLS] [SEP] In two provinces in Mozambique, the cyclone damaged or destroyed 25,000 houses, leaving at least 23,000 people homeless. [CLS] [SEP] Flooding in Zambia caused rivers to rise in Mozambique several days after the storm's passage. [CLS] [SEP] There were 17 deaths in Mozambique.
