Tropical Storm Carlotta was a moderate tropical cyclone that caused flooding in several states in southwestern and central Mexico. [CLS] [SEP] Carlotta, the third named storm of the 2018 Pacific hurricane season, formed as the result of a breakdown in the Intertropical Convergence Zone. [CLS] [SEP] On June 12, a broad area of low pressure developed several hundred miles south of Mexico and strengthened into a tropical storm by June 15. [CLS] [SEP] The next day, the system stalled unexpectedly within a favorable environment, which led to more intensification than originally anticipated. [CLS] [SEP] Early on June 17, Carlotta reached peak intensity with maximum sustained winds of 65 mph (100 km/h) and a minimum central pressure of 997 mbar (29.44 inHg) while located only 30 mi (50 km) south-southeast of Acapulco. [CLS] [SEP] The system then began to interact with land and experience wind shear, which resulted in the storm weakening to tropical depression status later in the day. [CLS] [SEP] The system weakened to a remnant low early on June 19 and dissipated several hours later. [CLS] [SEP] Carlotta prompted the issuance of multiple watches and warnings for the southern coast of Mexico. [CLS] [SEP] The storm caused three deaths, two of which were in Aguascalientes and the other in Oaxaca. [CLS] [SEP] Flooding and landslides also occurred throughout the states of Aguascalientes, Guerrero, Michoacán, Oaxaca, and Puebla, as well as in the Yucatán Peninsula. [CLS] [SEP] Damage from the system was reported to be minor. [CLS] [SEP]
