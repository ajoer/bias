[CLS] Uruguayan Air Force Flight 571, later known as Andes flight disaster and The Miracle of the Andes, was a chartered flight that originated in Montevideo, Uruguay, bound for Santiago, Chile. [SEP] [CLS] On October 13, 1972, while crossing the Andes, the inexperienced co-pilot of the Fairchild FH-227D who was in command mistakenly believed they had reached Curic√≥, Chile, despite instrument readings that indicated otherwise. [SEP] [CLS] The aircraft began descending too early to reach Pudahuel Airport, and struck a mountain, initially shearing off both wings and the tail section. [SEP] [CLS] The remaining portion of the fuselage slid down the mountain about 725 metres (2,379 ft) before striking ice and snow on a glacier. [SEP] [CLS] The flight was carrying 45 passengers and crew, including 19 members of the Old Christians Club rugby union team, along with their families, supporters, and friends. [SEP] [CLS] The wreck was located at an elevation of 3,570 metres (11,710 ft) in the remote Andes Mountains in far western Argentina, near the border with Chile. [SEP] [CLS] Three crew members and eight passengers died immediately, and several others died soon afterward due to the frigid temperatures and their serious injuries. [SEP] [CLS] Authorities immediately began searching for the aircraft and flew over the crash site several times during the next few days, but could not see the white fuselage against the snow. [SEP] [CLS] Search efforts were canceled after eight days. [SEP] [CLS] During the next 72 days, 13 more passengers died. [SEP] [CLS] The remaining survivors reluctantly resorted to eating the dead. [SEP] [CLS] Nando Parrado and Roberto Canessa climbed a 4,650 metres (15,260 ft) mountain peak without gear and hiked for 10 days into Chile. [SEP] [CLS] On December 23, 1972, 72 days after the crash, 16 survivors were rescued. [SEP] [CLS]
