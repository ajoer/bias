Tropical Storm Kirk was the second lowest-latitude tropical storm on record in the Atlantic basin. [CLS] [SEP] The eleventh named storm of the 2018 Atlantic hurricane season, Kirk originated from a tropical wave that left Africa on September 20 and organized into a tropical depression two days later. [CLS] [SEP] The system intensified into Tropical Storm Kirk early on September 22 but quickly degenerated into a tropical wave again early the next day. [CLS] [SEP] A reduction in the disturbance's forward speed allowed it to regain tropical storm intensity on September 26. [CLS] [SEP] Kirk reached maximum sustained winds of 65 mph (100 km/h) that morning before increasing westerly wind shear caused the cyclone to steadily weaken. [CLS] [SEP] The storm made landfall on Saint Lucia with winds of 50 mph (65 km/h) before continuing into the Caribbean Sea. [CLS] [SEP] Kirk degenerated to a tropical wave again on September 28, and its remnants continued westward, contributing to the formation of Hurricane Michael ten days later. [CLS] [SEP] Kirk passed narrowly north of Barbados, where tropical storm-force winds cut power to multiple neighborhoods and caused property damage at the official residence of the Governor-General. [CLS] [SEP] Rainfall in excess of 10 inches (250 mm) flooded structures and vehicles, prompting 11 emergency water rescues. [CLS] [SEP] In Saint Vincent and the Grenadines, rough seas caused coastal flooding and led to the presumed deaths of two fishermen after they ventured out during the storm. [CLS] [SEP] On Saint Lucia, strong winds destroyed two buildings; additional structures, including schools and the anemometer at the Hewanorra International Airport, sustained damage. [CLS] [SEP] About 2,000 chickens on a poultry farm were killed following the collapse of their pens, and about 80â€“90% of the island's banana crop was left in ruin. [CLS] [SEP] The combination of winds and landslides prompted widespread power outages. [CLS] [SEP] Lesser impacts were felt on Martinique, where winds damaged trees and cut power to about 3,000 homes. [CLS] [SEP]
