[CLS] Hurricane Hortense was the first tropical cyclone to make landfall in Guadeloupe and Puerto Rico since Hurricane Hugo in 1989, and the second most intense hurricane during the 1996 Atlantic hurricane season. [SEP] [CLS] The eighth tropical cyclone, eighth named storm, and sixth hurricane of the season. [SEP] [CLS] Hortense developed on September 3 from a tropical wave in the central Atlantic Ocean. [SEP] [CLS] Initially a tropical depression, it headed westward without significant strengthening for four days due to unfavorable upper-level winds. [SEP] [CLS] While nearing the Lesser Antilles upper-level winds decreased, allowing the depression to become Tropical Storm Hortense on September 7. [SEP] [CLS] Hortense crossed Guadeloupe on September 8 and entered the Caribbean Sea. [SEP] [CLS] By on the following day, it was upgraded to a hurricane while curving northwestward. [SEP] [CLS] Hortense made landfall in Puerto Rico on September 9 and brushed the Dominican Republic shortly thereafter. [SEP] [CLS] After re-entering the Atlantic, Hortense began to substantially strengthen and peaked as a 140 mph (220 km/h) Category 4 hurricane early on September 13. [SEP] [CLS] Thereafter, the storm steadily weakened as it tracked rapidly north-northeastward. [SEP] [CLS] Early on September 15, Hortense made landfall in Nova Scotia as a minimal Category 1 hurricane. [SEP] [CLS] It quickly weakened further to a tropical storm before re-entering the Atlantic to the south of Newfoundland. [SEP] [CLS] Late on September 15, Hortense transitioned into an extratropical cyclone and subsequently merged with a frontal system about 24 hours later. [SEP] [CLS] The storm produced heavy rainfall and gusty winds as it passed through the Lesser Antilles. [SEP] [CLS] On Guadeloupe, damage was most significant to crops, with over 50% of banana plantains destroyed. [SEP] [CLS] Localized flooding was reported on Martinique. [SEP] [CLS] Impact was most significant in Puerto Rico. [SEP] [CLS] Across the island, 11,463 houses were severely damaged. [SEP] [CLS] About 1.4 million people on Puerto Rico were left without electricity – equivalent to about 40% of the island's population. [SEP] [CLS] Damage in Puerto Rico was estimated at $153.4 million (1996 USD). [SEP] [CLS] There were also 19 deaths, most of which due to drowning during flash floods. [SEP] [CLS] In the Dominican Republic, strong winds damaged a number of buildings and houses, and downed several power lines. [SEP] [CLS] Flooding also forced the closure of several roads and impacted 80% of crops in Samaná Province. [SEP] [CLS] At least three fatalities were confirmed in that country. [SEP] [CLS] The storm brought strong winds to the Bahamas and Turks and Caicos Islands, and lesser winds to Bermuda. [SEP] [CLS] Later in its duration, Hortense struck Nova Scotia, bringing heavy rainfall and hurricane-force winds to isolated locations. [SEP] [CLS] There were many power outages, trees blown down, roofs torn away, and roads damaged in the Province. [SEP] [CLS] New Brunswick, Newfoundland, and Prince Edward Island were also impacted, though not as severely as in Nova Scotia. [SEP] [CLS] Damage in Atlantic Canada reached approximately $3.64 million. [SEP] [CLS]
