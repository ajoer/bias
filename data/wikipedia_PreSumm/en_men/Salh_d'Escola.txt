[CLS] Salh d'Escola (Occitan: [ˈsaʎ desˈkɔlɔ]; fl. [SEP] [CLS] 1195) was a troubadour from Bergerac in the Périgord, a former province of France. [SEP] [CLS] The meaning of his name, also spelled Sail or Saill, uncertain; it may be an unusual given name. [SEP] [CLS] His surname, likewise, may be a family name, but there is no known location called "Escola" that could render it a toponymic. [SEP] [CLS] The entire name may be a nickname meaning "defector from school" or "escapee from the cloister" , indicating that he quit his education, either in a school or a monastery. [SEP] [CLS] On the other hand, it may signify a pedant. [SEP] [CLS] The details of Salh's life are provided in two main sources, one contemporaneous and one late. [SEP] [CLS] The first source is the poem "Pos Peire d'Alvernh′ a chantat" composed by the troubadour monk of Montaudon in 1195. [SEP] [CLS] In it he good-naturedly criticises a gallery of troubadour, each in turn, usually humorously. [SEP] [CLS] One of those criticised is Salh d'Escola. [SEP] [CLS] According to the monk, Salh was a jongleur who went to Bergerac and became a merchant. [SEP] [CLS] The later source is Salh's vida (a short biography), which probably relied on "Pos Peire d'Alvernh′" to piece together its story. [SEP] [CLS] According to the anonymous biographer, Salh was the son of a merchant and became a jongleur. [SEP] [CLS] He then went to Narbonne and stayed for a long time at the court of "Ainermada de Narbona", the Viscountess Ermengard of Narbonne. [SEP] [CLS] Upon her death (1197), Salh entered the cloister at Bergerac and abandoned his "inventing [songs] and singing". [SEP] [CLS] Only on work by Salh, a canso (love song), has been preserved: "Gran esfortz fai qui chanta ni.s deporta". [SEP] [CLS] It is an amorous confession to his lady for telling her to "die" in a moment of desperation or irritation. [SEP] [CLS]
