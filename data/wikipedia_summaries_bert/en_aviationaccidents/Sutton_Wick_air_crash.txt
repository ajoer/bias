The Sutton Wick air crash occurred on 5 March 1957 when a Blackburn Beverley C Mk 1 heavy transport aircraft, serial number XH117, of 53 Squadron Royal Air Force crashed at Sutton Wick, Drayton, Berkshire, England, following a shut-down of one engine and partial loss of power on another. [CLS] [SEP] Shortly after take-off, No. [CLS] [SEP] 1 engine was shut down as a precautionary measure then whilst on final approach back to RAF Abingdon, No. [CLS] [SEP] 2 engine failed to respond to throttle inputs. [CLS] [SEP] The aeroplane struck cables and trees 18 minutes after lifting off. [CLS] [SEP] Of 17 passengers and five crew aboard, all but four were killed in the accident. [CLS] [SEP] Two people on the ground were also killed. [CLS] [SEP] An investigation found that a non-return valve in the fuel system had been installed the wrong way round causing two of the engines to be starved of fuel. [CLS] [SEP] The technician found responsible for incorrectly fitting the valve was charged under the Air Force Act. [CLS] [SEP] Following the accident, the non-return valve was re-designed so it could not be installed incorrectly.Two RAF officers who took part in the rescue after the crash were highly praised for "refusing to give up while there was hope of finding survivors among the wreckage."
