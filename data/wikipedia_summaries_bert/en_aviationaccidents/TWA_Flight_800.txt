Trans World Airlines Flight 800 (TWA 800) was a Boeing 747-100 that exploded and crashed into the Atlantic Ocean near East Moriches, New York, on July 17, 1996, at about 8:31 p.m. [CLS] [SEP] EDT, 12 minutes after takeoff from John F. [CLS] [SEP] Kennedy International Airport on a scheduled international passenger flight to Rome, with a stopover in Paris. [CLS] [SEP] All 230 people on board died in the crash; it is the third-deadliest aviation accident in U.S. [CLS] [SEP] history. [CLS] [SEP] Accident investigators from the National Transportation Safety Board (NTSB) traveled to the scene, arriving the following morning amid speculation that a terrorist attack was the cause of the crash. [CLS] [SEP] Consequently, the Federal Bureau of Investigation (FBI) and New York Police Department Joint Terrorism Task Force (JTTF) initiated a parallel criminal investigation. [CLS] [SEP] Sixteen months later, the JTTF announced that no evidence of a criminal act had been found and closed its active investigation.The four-year NTSB investigation concluded with the approval of the Aircraft Accident Report on August 23, 2000, ending the most extensive, complex and costly air disaster investigation in U.S. [CLS] [SEP] history to that time. [CLS] [SEP] The report's conclusion was that the probable cause of the accident was explosion of flammable fuel vapors in the center fuel tank. [CLS] [SEP] Although it could not be determined with certainty, the likely ignition source was a short circuit. [CLS] [SEP] Problems with the aircraft's wiring were found, including evidence of arcing in the Fuel Quantity Indication System (FQIS) wiring that enters the tank. [CLS] [SEP] The FQIS on Flight 800 is known to have been malfunctioning; the captain remarked on what he called "crazy" readings from the system approximately two minutes and thirty seconds before the aircraft exploded. [CLS] [SEP] As a result of the investigation, new requirements were developed for aircraft to prevent future fuel tank explosions. [CLS] [SEP]
