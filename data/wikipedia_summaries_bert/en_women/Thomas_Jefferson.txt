Thomas Jefferson (April 13, 1743 â€“ July 4, 1826) was an American statesman, diplomat, lawyer, architect, philosopher, and Founding Father who served as the third president of the United States from 1801 to 1809. [CLS] [SEP] He had previously served as the second vice president of the United States between 1797 and 1801. [CLS] [SEP] The principal author of the Declaration of Independence, Jefferson was a proponent of democracy, republicanism, and individual rights, motivating American colonists to break from the Kingdom of Great Britain and form a new nation; he produced formative documents and decisions at both the state and national level. [CLS] [SEP] During the American Revolution, Jefferson represented Virginia in the Continental Congress that adopted the Declaration, drafted the law for religious freedom as a Virginia legislator, and served as the second Governor of Virginia from 1779 to 1781, during the American Revolutionary War. [CLS] [SEP] In May 1785, Jefferson was appointed the United States Minister to France, and subsequently, the nation's first secretary of state under President George Washington from 1790 to 1793. [CLS] [SEP] Jefferson and James Madison organized the Democratic-Republican Party to oppose the Federalist Party during the formation of the First Party System. [CLS] [SEP] With Madison, he anonymously wrote the provocative Kentucky and Virginia Resolutions in 1798 and 1799, which sought to strengthen states' rights by nullifying the federal Alien and Sedition Acts. [CLS] [SEP] As president, Jefferson pursued the nation's shipping and trade interests against Barbary pirates and aggressive British trade policies. [CLS] [SEP] Starting in 1803, Jefferson promoted a western expansionist policy, organizing the Louisiana Purchase, doubling the nation's land area. [CLS] [SEP] To make room for settlement, Jefferson began a controversial process of Indian tribal removal from the newly acquired territory. [CLS] [SEP] As a result of peace negotiations with France, his administration reduced military forces. [CLS] [SEP] Jefferson was reelected in 1804. [CLS] [SEP] His second term was beset with difficulties at home, including the trial of former vice president Aaron Burr. [CLS] [SEP] In 1807, American foreign trade was diminished when Jefferson implemented the Embargo Act in response to British threats to U.S. [CLS] [SEP] shipping. [CLS] [SEP] The same year, Jefferson signed the Act Prohibiting Importation of Slaves. [CLS] [SEP] Jefferson, while primarily a planter, lawyer and politician, mastered many disciplines, which ranged from surveying and mathematics to horticulture and mechanics.

[CLS] [SEP] After retiring from public office, Jefferson founded the University of Virginia. [CLS] [SEP] Along with Millard Fillmore who founded the University at Buffalo, he is one of only two U.S. [CLS] [SEP] presidents to found a university.
