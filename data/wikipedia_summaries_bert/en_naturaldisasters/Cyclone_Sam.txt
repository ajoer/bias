Cyclone Sam (JTWC designation: 03S) was an intense tropical cyclone that brought flooding rainfall to a wide swath of northern Australia in December 2000. [CLS] [SEP] The first tropical cyclone of the regional season, Sam originated from a tropical low that formed in the Arafura Sea on 28 November. [CLS] [SEP] Tracking generally westward, the initial low-pressure area remained generally weak until it entered the Timor Sea, by which time it had strengthened into a tropical cyclone on 5 December. [CLS] [SEP] Though a subtropical ridge was forcing the cyclone westward at the time, an approaching shortwave trough caused Sam to track southward the following day, towards the Australian coast. [CLS] [SEP] During its southward progression, Sam rapidly intensified, and reached its peak intensity on 8 December. [CLS] [SEP] Soon afterwards, the storm made landfall near Lagrange, Western Australia at the same intensity. [CLS] [SEP] Once inland, Sam was slow to weaken as it re-curved eastward, and persisted for nearly a week inland before dissipating on 14 December. [CLS] [SEP] Throughout its existence, Cyclone Sam brought heavy rainfall to a wide swath of northern Australia. [CLS] [SEP] Rainfall peaked at 520 mm (20 in) in Shelamar over a 48-hour period ending on 11 December. [CLS] [SEP] Upon making landfall, damage was considerable, albeit localized. [CLS] [SEP] Most of the destruction wrought by Sam occurred near the coast, particularly in Bidyadanga and Anna Springs Station. [CLS] [SEP] Some buildings sustained considerable damage, and trees and power lines were felled, resulting in some power outages. [CLS] [SEP] Offshore, 163 illegal immigrants aboard two vessels were feared to have drowned, which would make Sam one of the deadliest cyclones in Australian history. [CLS] [SEP] However, these people were later accounted for. [CLS] [SEP] After the season, the name Sam was retired from the regional naming list. [CLS] [SEP]
