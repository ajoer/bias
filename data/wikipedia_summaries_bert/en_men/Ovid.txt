Publius Ovidius Naso (Classical Latin: [ˈpuːblɪ.ʊs ɔˈwɪdɪ.ʊs ˈnaːsoː]; 20 March 43 BC – 17/18 AD), known as Ovid ( OV-id) in the English-speaking world, was a Roman poet who lived during the reign of Augustus. [CLS] [SEP] He was a contemporary of the older Virgil and Horace, with whom he is often ranked as one of the three canonical poets of Latin literature. [CLS] [SEP] The Imperial scholar Quintilian considered him the last of the Latin love elegists. [CLS] [SEP] Although Ovid enjoyed enormous popularity during his lifetime, the emperor Augustus banished him to a remote province on the Black Sea, where he remained until his death. [CLS] [SEP] Ovid himself attributes his exile to carmen et error, "a poem and a mistake", but his discretion in discussing the causes has resulted in much speculation among scholars. [CLS] [SEP] The first major Roman poet to begin his career during the reign of Augustus, Ovid is today best known for the Metamorphoses, a 15-book continuous mythological narrative written in the meter of epic, and for works in elegiac couplets such as Ars Amatoria ("The Art of Love") and Fasti. [CLS] [SEP] His poetry was much imitated during Late Antiquity and the Middle Ages, and greatly influenced Western art and literature. [CLS] [SEP] The Metamorphoses remains one of the most important sources of classical mythology. [CLS] [SEP]
