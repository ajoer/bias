[CLS] Cyclone Bonita in January 1996 struck both Madagascar and Mozambique, causing severe damage. [SEP] [CLS] The long-lived storm began developing in the last hours of 1995, and slowly consolidated over the open waters of the South-West Indian Ocean. [SEP] [CLS] Tracking generally toward the west-southwest, the disturbance received its name from Météo-France on January 5. [SEP] [CLS] Ultimately peaking as an intense tropical cyclone, Bonita bypassed Mauritius and Réunion to the north before striking northeastern Madagascar late on January 10. [SEP] [CLS] There, the storm affected up to 150,000 people, flooded wide tracts of croplands, and killed 25 people. [SEP] [CLS] In the aftermath, disaster relief came from both the government of Madagascar and the international community, as well as non-governmental organizations (NGOs); the United Nations Department of Humanitarian Affairs assisted in the distribution of about $450,000 in monetary donations. [SEP] [CLS] Bonita emerged into the Mozambique Channel as a significantly diminished storm, though it quickly regained some of its previous intensity. [SEP] [CLS] Three days after its initial landfall, the cyclone moved ashore over the Zambezia Province of Mozambique. [SEP] [CLS] Throughout northern parts of the country, Bonita triggered extensive flooding that damaged or destroyed hundreds of buildings and reportedly killed 17 individuals. [SEP] [CLS] Swollen rivers submerged roads and bridges, isolating some locations. [SEP] [CLS] A meteorological rarity, Bonita continued inland for several days, persisting as a distinct tropical low; the system traversed southern Africa and ultimately entered the South Atlantic Ocean. [SEP] [CLS] In the process, it dropped unseasonably heavy rainfall over Zimbabwe and Zamibia. [SEP] [CLS] A paper published by the Zambia Meteorological Department asserted that Bonita was the first storm confirmed to have tracked across the African continent from the South-West Indian Ocean to the Southern Atlantic Ocean.
