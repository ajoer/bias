The 1992 Pacific hurricane season is the most active Pacific hurricane season on record, featuring 27 named storms, and the second-costliest Pacific hurricane season in history, behind the 2013 season. [CLS] [SEP] The season also produced the second-highest ACE value on record in the basin, only surpassed by the 2018 season. [CLS] [SEP] The season officially started on May 15 in the eastern Pacific, and on June 1 in the central Pacific, and lasted until November 30. [CLS] [SEP] These dates conventionally delimit the period of each year when most tropical cyclones form in the northeastern Pacific Ocean. [CLS] [SEP] However, these bounds were easily exceeded when Hurricane Ekeka formed on January 28 and again a couple months later with Tropical Storm Hali.The most notable storm was Hurricane Iniki, which caused billions of dollars of damage to the Hawaiian Islands, primarily in Kauai, along with six casualties. [CLS] [SEP] Hurricanes Lester, Virgil, Winifred, and Orlene also made landfall and killed several people, but were significantly less destructive. [CLS] [SEP] Hurricane Darby and Tropical Storm Agatha brought rains and more destruction to Mexico, without making landfall. [CLS] [SEP] Hurricane Tina was, in addition to being the strongest storm of the year, the longest-lasting Pacific hurricane at the time. [CLS] [SEP]
