[CLS] The Air Bridge Denial (ABD) Program is an anti-narcotics program operated by the U.S. [SEP] [CLS] Central Intelligence Agency in Colombia and Peru. [SEP] [CLS] Starting in the 1990s, it targets traffickers transporting illicit drugs through the air by forcing down suspicious aircraft, using lethal force if necessary. [SEP] [CLS] The program was suspended in April 2001 when a legitimate civilian aircraft was shot down in Peru and two U.S. [SEP] [CLS] citizens were killed. [SEP] [CLS] It was restarted in Colombia in August 2003 after additional safeguards were established. [SEP] [CLS] As of 2005, the United States had provided $68 million for the program, which had so far produced only one drug seizure. [SEP] [CLS] In 2010 the Government Accountability Office produced a report stating that the program faced challenges and that the effectiveness of the program at stopping narcotics trafficking was difficult to assess. [SEP] [CLS] It noted, however, that the program often advanced broad foreign policy objectives of the United States. [SEP] [CLS]
