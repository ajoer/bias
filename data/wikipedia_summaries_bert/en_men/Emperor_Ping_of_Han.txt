[CLS] Emperor Ping (9 BC – 3 February 6 AD) was an emperor of the Chinese Han dynasty from 1 BC to AD 5. [SEP] [CLS] After Emperor Ai died childless, the throne was passed to his cousin Emperor Ping—then a child of eight years old. [SEP] [CLS] Wang Mang was appointed regent by the Grand Empress Dowager Wang. [SEP] [CLS] Dissatisfied with his father's dictatorial regency, in AD 3, Wang's son Wang Yu (王宇) conspired with Emperor Ping's maternal uncles of the Wei clan against Wang, but after they were discovered, Wang had not only Wang Yu and the Weis (except Consort Wei) put to death, but also used this opportunity to accuse many actual or potential political enemies as being part of the conspiracy and to execute or exile them. [SEP] [CLS] From then onwards, the Han Dynasty existed only in name. [SEP] [CLS] Furthermore, Wang Mang also designated his daughter as the empress consort to Emperor Ping to codify his legitimacy to power. [SEP] [CLS] Emperor Ping was allegedly poisoned by Wang Mang after reigning less than six years, because Wang was concerned that he would avenge his uncles, and his successor, the infant Emperor Ruzi, would be chosen by none other than Wang Mang himself.
