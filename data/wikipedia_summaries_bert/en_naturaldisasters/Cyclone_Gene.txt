[CLS] Severe Tropical Cyclone Gene was the deadliest storm as well as the most damaging tropical cyclone of the 2007–08 South Pacific cyclone season east of 160ºE. [SEP] [CLS] RSMC Nadi monitored Gene as the 12th tropical disturbance, as well as the fourth tropical cyclone and the third severe tropical cyclone to form west of 160ºE during the 2007–08 South Pacific cyclone season. [SEP] [CLS] Gene was also recognised by RSMC Nadi as the fifth tropical cyclone and fourth severe tropical cyclone to form within the South Pacific Ocean during the 2007-08 season. [SEP] [CLS] On January 25, a tropical disturbance formed within the Fijian Archipelago and was designated as Tropical Disturbance 12F. [SEP] [CLS] The next day it was upgraded to a tropical depression, whilst on January 27, RSMC Nadi named the depression as Cyclone Gene. [SEP] [CLS] Later that day Gene made landfall on Fiji, and caused 8 deaths and $51 million (2008, F$). [SEP] [CLS] Cyclone Gene then slowly intensified to a category three cyclone on both the Saffir–Simpson hurricane scale and the Australian Cyclone Intensity Scale. [SEP] [CLS] Gene then took a turn to the south moving towards 25°S which marks the edge of RSMC Nadi's area of responsibility with the Tropical Cyclone Warning Centre (TCWC) in Wellington, New Zealand. [SEP] [CLS] Gene then crossed 25°S on February 3 and Nadi released their final advisory. [SEP] [CLS] Cyclone Gene continued as a Tropical Cyclone for three days before becoming an extratropical cyclone. [SEP] [CLS] Early on February 6 TCWC Wellington released their final advisory on tropical cyclone Gene as they declared it as extratropical. [SEP] [CLS] Cyclone Gene caused widespread damage to several of Fiji's main islands, including Viti Levu, Vanua Levu, Taveuni, Yasawa, Mamanuca, and other outlying island groups, while killing a total of 8 people. [SEP] [CLS] The cyclone also caused severe damage to Vanautu's Futuna island after its outer bands lashed the island with gale force windspeeds and heavy rain for 12 hours. [SEP] [CLS]
