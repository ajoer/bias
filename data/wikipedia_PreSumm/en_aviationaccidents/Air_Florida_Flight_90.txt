[CLS] Air Florida Flight 90 was a scheduled U.S. [SEP] [CLS] domestic passenger flight operated by Air Florida from Washington National Airport (now Ronald Reagan Washington National Airport) to Fort Lauderdaleâ€“Hollywood International Airport with an intermediate stopover at Tampa International Airport. [SEP] [CLS] On January 13, 1982, the Boeing 737-222 registered as N62AF crashed into the 14th Street Bridge over the Potomac River.Striking the bridge, which carries Interstate 395 between Washington, D.C. [SEP] [CLS] and Arlington County, Virginia, it hit seven occupied vehicles and destroyed 97 feet (30 m) of guard rail before plunging through the ice into the Potomac River. [SEP] [CLS] The aircraft was carrying 74 passengers and five crew members. [SEP] [CLS] Only four passengers and one crew member (a flight attendant) were rescued from the crash and survived. [SEP] [CLS] Another passenger, Arland D. [SEP] [CLS] Williams, Jr., assisted in the rescue of the survivors but drowned before he could be rescued. [SEP] [CLS] Four motorists on the bridge were killed. [SEP] [CLS] The survivors were rescued from the icy river by civilians and professionals. [SEP] [CLS] President Ronald Reagan commended these acts during his State of the Union speech a few days later. [SEP] [CLS] The National Transportation Safety Board (NTSB) determined that the cause of the accident was pilot error. [SEP] [CLS] The pilots failed to switch on the engines' internal ice protection systems, used reverse thrust in a snowstorm prior to takeoff, tried to use the jet exhaust of a plane in front of them to melt their ice, and failed to abort the takeoff even after detecting a power problem while taxiing and seeing ice and snow buildup on the wings.
