Andrew Jackson (March 15, 1767 – June 8, 1845) was an American soldier and statesman who served as the seventh president of the United States from 1829 to 1837. [CLS] [SEP] Before being elected to the presidency, Jackson gained fame as a general in the United States Army and served in both houses of the U.S. [CLS] [SEP] Congress. [CLS] [SEP] As president, Jackson sought to advance the rights of the "common man" against a "corrupt aristocracy" and to preserve the Union. [CLS] [SEP] Born in the colonial Carolinas to a Scotch-Irish family in the decade before the American Revolutionary War, Jackson became a frontier lawyer and married Rachel Donelson Robards. [CLS] [SEP] He served briefly in the United States House of Representatives and the United States Senate, representing Tennessee. [CLS] [SEP] After resigning, he served as a justice on the Tennessee Supreme Court from 1798 until 1804. [CLS] [SEP] Jackson purchased a property later known as The Hermitage, and became a wealthy, slaveowning planter. [CLS] [SEP] In 1801, he was appointed colonel of the Tennessee militia and was elected its commander the following year. [CLS] [SEP] He led troops during the Creek War of 1813–1814, winning the Battle of Horseshoe Bend. [CLS] [SEP] The subsequent Treaty of Fort Jackson required the Creek surrender of vast lands in present-day Alabama and Georgia. [CLS] [SEP] In the concurrent war against the British, Jackson's victory in 1815 at the Battle of New Orleans made him a national hero. [CLS] [SEP] Jackson then led U.S. [CLS] [SEP] forces in the First Seminole War, which led to the annexation of Florida from Spain. [CLS] [SEP] Jackson briefly served as Florida's first territorial governor before returning to the Senate. [CLS] [SEP] He ran for president in 1824, winning a plurality of the popular and electoral vote. [CLS] [SEP] As no candidate won an electoral majority, the House of Representatives elected John Quincy Adams in a contingent election. [CLS] [SEP] In reaction to the alleged "corrupt bargain" between Adams and Henry Clay and the ambitious agenda of President Adams, Jackson's supporters founded the Democratic Party. [CLS] [SEP] Jackson ran again in 1828, defeating Adams in a landslide. [CLS] [SEP] Jackson faced the threat of secession by South Carolina over what opponents called the "Tariff of Abominations". [CLS] [SEP] The crisis was defused when the tariff was amended, and Jackson threatened the use of military force if South Carolina attempted to secede. [CLS] [SEP] In Congress, Henry Clay led the effort to reauthorize the Second Bank of the United States. [CLS] [SEP] Jackson, regarding the Bank as a corrupt institution that benefited the wealthy at the expense of ordinary Americans, vetoed the renewal of its charter. [CLS] [SEP] After a lengthy struggle, Jackson and his allies thoroughly dismantled the Bank. [CLS] [SEP] In 1835, Jackson became the only president to completely pay off the national debt, fulfilling a longtime goal. [CLS] [SEP] While Jackson pursued numerous reforms designed to eliminate waste and corruption, his presidency marked the beginning of the ascendancy of the party "spoils system" in American politics. [CLS] [SEP] In 1830, Jackson signed the Indian Removal Act, which forcibly relocated most members of the Native American tribes in the South to Indian Territory. [CLS] [SEP] The relocation process dispossessed the Indians and resulted in widespread death and disease. [CLS] [SEP] Jackson opposed the abolitionist movement, which grew stronger in his second term. [CLS] [SEP] In foreign affairs, Jackson's administration concluded a "most favored nation" treaty with Great Britain, settled claims of damages against France from the Napoleonic Wars, and recognized the Republic of Texas. [CLS] [SEP] In January 1835, he survived the first assassination attempt on a sitting president. [CLS] [SEP] In his retirement, Jackson remained active in Democratic Party politics, supporting the presidencies of Martin Van Buren and James K. [CLS] [SEP] Polk. [CLS] [SEP] Though fearful of its effects on the slavery debate, Jackson advocated the annexation of Texas, which was accomplished shortly before his death. [CLS] [SEP] Jackson has been widely revered in the United States as an advocate for democracy and the common man. [CLS] [SEP] Many of his actions proved divisive, garnering both fervent support and strong opposition from many in the country. [CLS] [SEP] His reputation has suffered since the 1970s, largely due to his role in Native American removal. [CLS] [SEP] Surveys of historians and scholars have ranked Jackson favorably among U.S. [CLS] [SEP] presidents. [CLS] [SEP]
