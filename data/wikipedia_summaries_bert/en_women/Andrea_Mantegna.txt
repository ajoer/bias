Andrea Mantegna (UK: , US: , Italian: [anˈdrɛːa manˈteɲɲa]; c. [CLS] [SEP] 1431 – September 13, 1506) was an Italian painter, a student of Roman archeology, and son-in-law of Jacopo Bellini. [CLS] [SEP] Like other artists of the time, Mantegna experimented with perspective, e.g. [CLS] [SEP] by lowering the horizon in order to create a sense of greater monumentality. [CLS] [SEP] His flinty, metallic landscapes and somewhat stony figures give evidence of a fundamentally sculptural approach to painting. [CLS] [SEP] He also led a workshop that was the leading producer of prints in Venice before 1500. [CLS] [SEP]
