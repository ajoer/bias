[CLS] On 31 December 2017 at about 3:15 pm AEDT (UTC+11:00), a de Havilland Canada DHC-2 Beaver configured as a floatplane crashed into Jerusalem Bay off Cowan Creek, on the northern outskirts of Sydney, Australia. [SEP] [CLS] The aircraft, operated by Sydney Seaplanes, was carrying five passengers and a pilot, all of whom were killed in the crash. [SEP] [CLS] It was returning diners from Cottage Point Inn restaurant to Rose Bay Water Airport. [SEP] [CLS] The ATSB believes it probable that the pilot's performance was adversely affected by carbon monoxide poisoning. [SEP] [CLS] Post mortem tests on the bodies of the victims showed raised levels of CO in the blood, and a crack in the exhaust system was seen as the likely source of the gas. [SEP] [CLS]
