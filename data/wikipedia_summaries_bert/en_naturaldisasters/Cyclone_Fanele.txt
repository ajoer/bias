[CLS] Cyclone Fanele was the first cyclone of tropical cyclone status to strike western Madagascar since Cyclone Fame one year prior. [SEP] [CLS] It formed on January 18, 2009 in the Mozambique Channel, and rapidly organized as it remained nearly stationary. [SEP] [CLS] Fanele ultimately turned toward the southwest Madagascar coastline, reaching peak winds of 185 km/h (115 mph), according to the Réunion Météo-France office (MFR). [SEP] [CLS] It weakened before moving ashore in Menabe Region southwest of Morondava, and rapidly weakened over land. [SEP] [CLS] Fanele briefly re-intensified after reaching open waters, only to become an extratropical cyclone by January 23. [SEP] [CLS] The cyclone caused heavy damage near where it moved ashore and along its path, resulting in ten deaths. [SEP] [CLS] Fanele struck Madagascar just two days after Tropical Storm Eric brushed the northeastern portion of the country. [SEP] [CLS] The two storms affected over 50,000 people, of which at least 4,000 were left homeless. [SEP] [CLS] Fanele struck the country during a series of government protests, and consequentially relief efforts were hindered. [SEP] [CLS]
