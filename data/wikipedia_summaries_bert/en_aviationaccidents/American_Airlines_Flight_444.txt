American Airlines Flight 444 was a Boeing 727 flying from Chicago to Washington, D.C.'s National Airport piloted by captain Donald M. [CLS] [SEP] Tynan, which, on November 15, 1979, was attacked by the Unabomber Ted Kaczynski. [CLS] [SEP] The bomb planted in the cargo hold caused "a sucking explosion and a loss of pressure," which was then followed by large quantities of smoke filling the passenger cabin, forcing the pilots to make an emergency landing at Dulles International Airport. [CLS] [SEP] Twelve passengers had to be treated afterward for smoke inhalation. [CLS] [SEP] It was later determined that the bomb was powerful enough to have destroyed the aircraft if it had worked correctly. [CLS] [SEP] This was not the first Unabomber attack, but it was the attack which led to the FBI investigation into the Unabomber, as airliner bombing is a federal crime. [CLS] [SEP]
