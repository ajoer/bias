Severe Tropical Cyclone Gita was the most intense tropical cyclone to impact Tonga since reliable records began. [CLS] [SEP] The second named storm and first major tropical cyclone of the 2017–18 South Pacific cyclone season, Gita originated from a monsoon trough that was active in the South Pacific in early February 2018. [CLS] [SEP] First classified as a tropical disturbance on 3 February, the nascent system meandered near Vanuatu for several days with little development. [CLS] [SEP] After acquiring a steady east trajectory near Fiji, it organized into a Category 1 tropical cyclone on 9 February near Samoa. [CLS] [SEP] Arcing south in a clockwise turn, the system rapidly intensified, and became a severe tropical cyclone on 10 February near Niue. [CLS] [SEP] Throughout its path in the South Pacific, Cyclone Gita affected multiple island nations and territories. [CLS] [SEP] Tonga was the hardest-hit, with severe damage occurring on the islands of Tongatapu and ʻEua; two fatalities and forty-one injuries occurred in the kingdom. [CLS] [SEP] At least 171 homes were destroyed and more than 1,100 suffered damage. [CLS] [SEP] Violent winds destroyed homes and left the two islands largely without power. [CLS] [SEP] Torrential rains and damaging winds caused widespread disruptions in Samoa and American Samoa, prompting emergency declarations in both. [CLS] [SEP] Outlying islands in the Fijian Lau Islands were significantly affected, particularly Ono-i-Lau and Vatoa. [CLS] [SEP] Wallis and Futuna, Niue, and Vanuatu were also affected, but impacts in those areas were minor. [CLS] [SEP] Total damages from Gita are estimated at approximately US$250 million.
