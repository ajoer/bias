[CLS] Carlos Frederico Werneck de Lacerda (30 April 1914 – 21 May 1977) was a Brazilian journalist and politician. [SEP] [CLS] Born in Rio de Janeiro, Lacerda was the son of a family of politicians from Vassouras, Rio de Janeiro state. [SEP] [CLS] When he was a law student, Lacerda became sympathetic to left-wing ideas, but by the 1940s, he had transformed into a staunch anticommunist and conservative. [SEP] [CLS] He started his journalism career at Diário de Notícias (English: Daily News) in 1929. [SEP] [CLS] In 1949 he founded the newspaper Tribuna da Imprensa (English: Press Tribune). [SEP] [CLS] Starting his political career in 1947, Lacerda was elected to the legislative chamber (city council) of the city of Rio de Janeiro. [SEP] [CLS] In 1950, he was elected a National Democratic Union representative for the state of Rio in the Chamber of Deputies. [SEP] [CLS] He became well known for his uncompromising opposition of the government of President Getúlio Vargas and even demanded the overthrow of Vargas. [SEP] [CLS] He survived an assassination attempt in August 1954, which became known as the crime of Rua Tonelero. [SEP] [CLS] It is widely believed by historians to have been made by men acting under the orders of Gregório Fortunato, O Anjo Negro (Portuguese for "The Black Angel"), a black man, who was the head of Vargas' personal bodyguards. [SEP] [CLS] Brazilian Air Force Major Rubens Vaz was killed in the attempt, and Lacerda was slightly injured. [SEP] [CLS] That sparked a political crisis that culminated with the suicide of Vargas. [SEP] [CLS] Lacerda was re-elected to the Chamber of Deputies later in 1954, with more votes than any other candidate. [SEP] [CLS] He also opposed the government of President Juscelino Kubitschek. [SEP] [CLS] Lacerda was elected governor of Guanabara State, comprising Rio, in 1960. [SEP] [CLS] His administration was praised by the US government and the IMF for his efforts to solve some chronic problems of Rio such as water services, public transportation and housing. [SEP] [CLS] As part of this drive, Lacerda ordered areas of the city - often areas targeted by developers - to be cleared of the inhabitants. [SEP] [CLS] Over this period, up to 140,000 people were evicted, mostly from the three favelas on the Rodrigo de Freitas lagoon, located near the beaches of the city’s south zone. [SEP] [CLS] An opinionated and controversial politician, Lacerda was involved in the crisis of the resignation of President Jânio Quadros in 1961 and conspired against the presidency of João Goulart. [SEP] [CLS] Hoping to be elected president in the 1965 elections, Lacerda initially supported the military coup d'état of 1964 and was nominated the UDN candidate. [SEP] [CLS] Since the military was not willing to give up power, the 1965 elections were cancelled, and Lacerda definitely fell from the military's favor. [SEP] [CLS] In 1968, his efforts to restore democracy in Brazil made him ally with his old enemies, Kubitschek and Goulart, and Lacerda was arrested for a brief period and stripped of his right to run for political office for ten years. [SEP] [CLS] Then, he retired from politics and resumed his journalism and publishing career. [SEP] [CLS] In 1977, he died suddenly in Rio de Janeiro from a heart attack. [SEP] [CLS]
