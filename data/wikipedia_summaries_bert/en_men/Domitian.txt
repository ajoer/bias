[CLS] Domitian (; born Titus Flavius Domitianus; 24 October 51 â€“ 18 September 96) was Roman emperor from 81 to 96. [SEP] [CLS] He was the son of Vespasian and the younger brother of Titus, his two predecessors on the throne, and the last member of the Flavian dynasty. [SEP] [CLS] During his reign, the authoritarian nature of his rule put him at sharp odds with the Senate, whose powers he drastically curtailed. [SEP] [CLS] Domitian had a minor and largely ceremonial role during the reigns of his father and brother. [SEP] [CLS] After the death of his brother, Domitian was declared emperor by the Praetorian Guard. [SEP] [CLS] His 15-year reign was the longest since that of Tiberius. [SEP] [CLS] As emperor, Domitian strengthened the economy by revaluing the Roman coinage, expanded the border defenses of the empire, and initiated a massive building program to restore the damaged city of Rome. [SEP] [CLS] Significant wars were fought in Britain, where his general Agricola attempted to conquer Caledonia (Scotland), and in Dacia, where Domitian was unable to procure a decisive victory against king Decebalus. [SEP] [CLS] Domitian's government exhibited strong authoritarian characteristics. [SEP] [CLS] Religious, military, and cultural propaganda fostered a cult of personality, and by nominating himself perpetual censor, he sought to control public and private morals. [SEP] [CLS] As a consequence, Domitian was popular with the people and army, but considered a tyrant by members of the Roman Senate. [SEP] [CLS] Domitian's reign came to an end in 96 when he was assassinated by court officials. [SEP] [CLS] He was succeeded the same day by his advisor Nerva. [SEP] [CLS] After his death, Domitian's memory was condemned to oblivion by the Senate, while senatorial authors such as Tacitus, Pliny the Younger, and Suetonius propagated the view of Domitian as a cruel and paranoid tyrant. [SEP] [CLS] Modern revisionists instead have characterized Domitian as a ruthless but efficient autocrat whose cultural, economic, and political programs provided the foundation of the peaceful second century.
