[CLS] Hurricane Leslie (known as Storm Leslie or Cyclone Leslie in Portugal and Spain while extratropical) was the strongest cyclone of tropical origin to strike the Iberian Peninsula since 1842. [SEP] [CLS] A large, long-lived, and very erratic tropical cyclone, Leslie was the twelfth named storm and sixth hurricane of the 2018 Atlantic hurricane season. [SEP] [CLS] The storm had a non-tropical origin, developing from an extratropical cyclone that situated over the northern Atlantic on 22 September. [SEP] [CLS] The low quickly acquired subtropical characteristics and was classified as Subtropical Storm Leslie on the following day. [SEP] [CLS] The cyclone meandered over the northern Atlantic and gradually weakened, before merging with a frontal system on 25 September, which later intensified into a powerful hurricane-force extratropical low over the northern Atlantic. [SEP] [CLS] While Leslie began to weaken late on 27 September, the low began to re-acquire subtropical characteristics, and by 28 September, Leslie had completed the transition to a subtropical storm once again. [SEP] [CLS] Leslie became fully tropical and gradually intensified, becoming a Category 1 hurricane early on 3 October, and initially peaked with 1-minute sustained winds of 140 km/h (85 mph) later that day. [SEP] [CLS] Leslie gradually weakened, falling to tropical storm intensity late on 4 October. [SEP] [CLS] The cyclone continued to slowly weaken before beginning to re-intensify on 8 October. [SEP] [CLS] Two days later, Leslie reached hurricane status for the second time. [SEP] [CLS] Leslie continued to slowly strengthen, reaching peak intensity with sustained winds of 150 km/h (90 mph) and a minimum central pressure of 968 hPa (28.59 inHg), early on 12 October. [SEP] [CLS] Leslie then began to gradually weaken later that day, while accelerating towards the northeast and passed far south of the Azores. [SEP] [CLS] On 13 October, Leslie passed north of Madeira, before transiting to an extratropical cyclone just off the Portuguese coast later. [SEP] [CLS] Leslie's extratropical remnant made landfall in central Portugal a few hours later. [SEP] [CLS] The extratropical low continued moving northeastward while rapidly weakening, passing over the Bay of Biscay, before dissipating on 16 October over western France. [SEP] [CLS] Hurricane Leslie prompted the issuance of tropical storm watches and warnings for Madeira Island, the first in its history. [SEP] [CLS] The storm was also responsible for 16 deaths, including 2 in Portugal and 14 in France. [SEP] [CLS] In November 2018, Aon estimated that Leslie's damage total exceeded US$500 million.
