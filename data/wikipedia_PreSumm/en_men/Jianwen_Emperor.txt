[CLS] The Jianwen Emperor (Chinese: 建文帝; pinyin: Jiànwén Dì; born 5 December 1377, disappeared from 13 July 1402) was the second Emperor of the Ming dynasty, reigned from 1398 to 1402. [SEP] [CLS] His personal name was Zhu Yunwen (朱允炆). [SEP] [CLS] The era name of his reign, Jianwen, means "establishing civility" and represented a sharp change in tone from Hongwu ("vastly martial"), the era name of the reign of his grandfather and predecessor, the Hongwu Emperor. [SEP] [CLS] His reign did not last long: an attempt to restrain his uncles led to the Jingnan rebellion. [SEP] [CLS] The Jianwen Emperor was eventually overthrown by one of his uncles, Zhu Di, who was then enthroned as the Yongle Emperor. [SEP] [CLS] Although the Yongle Emperor presented a charred body as Zhu Yunwen's, rumours circulated for decades that the Jianwen Emperor had disguised himself as a Buddhist monk and escaped from the palace when it was set on fire by Zhu Di's forces. [SEP] [CLS] Some people speculated that one of the reasons behind why the Yongle Emperor sponsored the admiral Zheng He on his treasure voyages in the early 15th century, was for Zheng He to search for the Jianwen Emperor, who was believed to have survived and fled to Southeast Asia. [SEP] [CLS] Some historians believe that the Jianwen Emperor had indeed survived and escaped from Nanjing, but the official histories of the Ming dynasty were modified later during the Qing dynasty to please the Manchu rulers.
