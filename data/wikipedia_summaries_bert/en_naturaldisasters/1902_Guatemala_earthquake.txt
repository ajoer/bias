[CLS] The 1902 Guatemala earthquake occurred on April 18 at 8:23 pm with a moment magnitude of 7.5 and a maximum Mercalli intensity of VIII (Severe). [SEP] [CLS] The rupture initiated at a depth of 25 km (16 mi) and the duration was 1 to 2 minutes. [SEP] [CLS] The foreshock and aftershock sequence of this incident were major. [SEP] [CLS] Before the main shock, there was an earthquake swarm which persisted for three months, and the tremors afterwards lasted for more than two weeks. [SEP] [CLS] With hindsight, it is clear that this swarm and the mainshock were clear indicators of the awakening of the long-dormant Vulcan Santa Maria located 97 km (60 mi) to the Northwest, which led to the historic explosive eruption of 1902 which occurred 6 months later in October. [SEP] [CLS] A majority of churches in western Guatemala and eastern Chiapas were either severely devastated or abolished. [SEP] [CLS] The number of people killed was between 800 and 2,000.A strange occurrence of heavy rains, lightning, and thunder took place shortly before the earthquake. [SEP] [CLS] A few weeks before the earthquake there was rain every afternoon for several days straight. [SEP] [CLS] Guatemala City was instantly flooded when massive gaps opened in the streets, water pipes ruptured, and huts along with cathedrals disintegrated and collapsed, which also buried hundreds. [SEP] [CLS] In just one hour, approximately 80,000 people were made homeless.As soon as the earthquake took place the sky cleared up and there was no rain for approximately three weeks. [SEP] [CLS] It has been said that the earthquake had something to do with an atmospheric disturbance connected with an electrical nature. [SEP] [CLS] The reason for this is because the early storms were electrical storms. [SEP] [CLS]
