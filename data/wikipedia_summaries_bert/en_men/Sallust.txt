[CLS] Gaius Sallustius Crispus, usually anglicised as Sallust (; 86 – c. [SEP] [CLS] 35 BC), was a Roman historian and politician from an Italian plebeian family. [SEP] [CLS] Sallust was born at Amiternum in the country of the Sabines and was a popularis, an opponent of the old Roman aristocracy, throughout his career, and later a partisan of Julius Caesar. [SEP] [CLS] Sallust is the earliest known Roman historian with surviving works to his name, of which Catiline's War (about the conspiracy in 63 BC of L. [SEP] [CLS] Sergius Catilina), The Jugurthine War (about Rome's war against the Numidian King Jugurtha from 111 to 105 BC), and the Histories (of which only fragments survive) are still extant. [SEP] [CLS] Sallust was primarily influenced by the Greek historian Thucydides and amassed great (and ill-gotten) wealth from his governorship of Africa. [SEP] [CLS]
