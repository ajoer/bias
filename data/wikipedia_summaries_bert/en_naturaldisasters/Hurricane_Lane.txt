Hurricane Lane was a powerful tropical cyclone that brought torrential rainfall and strong winds to Hawaii during late August 2018. [CLS] [SEP] The storm was the wettest on record in Hawaii, with peak rainfall accumulations of 58 in (1,473 mm) along the eastern slopes of Mauna Loa. [CLS] [SEP] Lane was the twelfth named storm, sixth hurricane, fourth major hurricane, and the first of three Category 5 hurricanes of the record-breaking 2018 Pacific hurricane season. [CLS] [SEP] The cyclone originated from an area of low pressure that formed well southwest of Mexico on August 13. [CLS] [SEP] Tracking west through a region of favorable atmospheric and oceanic conditions, the system steadily intensified over the following days. [CLS] [SEP] It reached an initial peak as a Category 4 hurricane on August 18. [CLS] [SEP] Temporarily inhibited by more hostile conditions, the hurricane weakened slightly before regaining strength and reaching Category 5 status on August 22 to the south of Hawaii. [CLS] [SEP] Lane peaked with winds of 160 mph (260 km/h) and a barometric pressure of 926 mbar (hPa; 27.34 inHg). [CLS] [SEP] Thereafter, the hurricane turned north and slowed. [CLS] [SEP] During this period, torrential rains battered much of the Hawaiian Islands. [CLS] [SEP] Unfavorable conditions again affected the hurricane, and it degraded to a tropical depression by August 28 before dissipating the following day. [CLS] [SEP] Lane prompted the issuance of hurricane watches and warnings for every island in Hawaii. [CLS] [SEP] From August 22 to 26, Lane brought heavy rain to much of the Hawaiian Windward Islands, which caused flash flooding and mudslides. [CLS] [SEP] Effects were most significant in and around Hilo where multiple neighborhoods were flooded. [CLS] [SEP] Across the Big Island, 159 structures were damaged or destroyed. [CLS] [SEP] Strong winds downed trees and power lines on Maui, and brush fires ignited on both Maui and Oahu. [CLS] [SEP] One fatality occurred on Kauai. [CLS] [SEP] Landslides and flooding damaged roads statewide; repairs concluded in April 2019. [CLS] [SEP] Total economic losses from the hurricane exceeded $250 million. [CLS] [SEP] In September, President Donald Trump declared much of Hawaii a disaster area; the Federal Emergency Management Agency ultimately provided about $10 million in aid. [CLS] [SEP]
