Germanwings Flight 9525 was a scheduled international passenger flight from Barcelona–El Prat Airport in Spain to Düsseldorf Airport in Germany. [CLS] [SEP] The flight was operated by Germanwings, a low-cost carrier owned by the German airline Lufthansa. [CLS] [SEP] On 24 March 2015, the aircraft, an Airbus A320-211, crashed 100 km (62 mi; 54 nmi) north-west of Nice in the French Alps. [CLS] [SEP] All 144 passengers and six crew members were killed. [CLS] [SEP] It was Germanwings' first fatal crash in the 18-year history of the company. [CLS] [SEP] The investigation determined that the crash was caused deliberately by the co-pilot, Andreas Lubitz, who had previously been treated for suicidal tendencies and declared "unfit to work" by his doctor. [CLS] [SEP] Lubitz kept this information from his employer and instead reported for duty. [CLS] [SEP] Shortly after reaching cruise altitude and while the captain was out of the cockpit, he locked the cockpit door and initiated a controlled descent that continued until the aircraft impacted a mountainside. [CLS] [SEP] In response to the incident and the circumstances of the co-pilot's involvement, aviation authorities in some countries implemented new regulations that require the presence of two authorized personnel in the cockpit at all times. [CLS] [SEP] Three days after the incident, the European Aviation Safety Agency issued a temporary recommendation for airlines to ensure that at least two crew members—including at least one pilot—were in the cockpit for the entire duration of the flight. [CLS] [SEP] Several airlines announced that they had already adopted similar policies voluntarily. [CLS] [SEP]
