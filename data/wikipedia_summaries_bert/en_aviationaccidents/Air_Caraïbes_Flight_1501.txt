Air Caraïbes Flight 1501 (TX1501/FWI1501) was a scheduled international passenger flight, flying from Saint Martin Airport in the Dutch overseas territory of Sint Maarten to Saint Barthélemy Airport in the French overseas region of Guadeloupe. [CLS] [SEP] The flight was operated by Air Caraïbes, a Caribbean regional airline, using a de Havilland Canada DHC-6-300 Twin Otter. [CLS] [SEP] On 24 March 2001, during an approach to Saint Barthélemy Airport, the DHC-6 Twin Otter banked steeply to the left and crashed onto a house, killing all 19 passengers and crew on board. [CLS] [SEP] One person on the ground was also killed in the explosions that followed. [CLS] [SEP] The crash was the third deadliest plane crash in Guadeloupe, behind Air France Flight 212 and Air France Flight 117, and was the 11th deadliest involving a Twin Otter. [CLS] [SEP] Investigation by the French Bureau d'Enquêtes et d'Analyses pour la Sécurité de l'Aviation Civile (or BEA) concluded that the cause of the crash was due to an error by the flight crew in managing the plane's thrust lever. [CLS] [SEP] During its final approach to Saint Barthélemy, the crew caused one of the aircraft's engines to reverse by moving the thrust lever back to the "beta" range, creating a thrust asymmetry which caused the aircraft to bank steeply to the left and crash. [CLS] [SEP] According to the BEA, this was the first fatal accident in the Twin Otter whereby an accidental thrust selection caused a propeller to enter the Beta range. [CLS] [SEP] The investigation was hampered by the lack of a flight recorder on the plane. [CLS] [SEP] After the crash, the BEA made a mandatory recommendation to equip every transport plane with at least one flight recorder. [CLS] [SEP]
