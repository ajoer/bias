Severe flooding occurred during the 2011 monsoon season in Thailand. [CLS] [SEP] The flooding began at the end of July triggered by the landfall of Tropical Storm Nock-ten. [CLS] [SEP] These floods soon spread through the provinces of northern, northeastern, and central Thailand along the Mekong and Chao Phraya river basins. [CLS] [SEP] In October floodwaters reached the mouth of the Chao Phraya and inundated parts of the capital city of Bangkok. [CLS] [SEP] Flooding persisted in some areas until mid-January 2012, and resulted in a total of 815 deaths (with three missing) and 13.6 million people affected. [CLS] [SEP] Sixty-five of Thailand's 76 provinces were declared flood disaster zones, and over 20,000 square kilometres (7,700 sq mi) of farmland was damaged. [CLS] [SEP] The disaster has been described as "the worst flooding yet in terms of...water and people affected." The World Bank has estimated 1,425 trillion baht (US$46.5 billion) in economic damages and losses due to flooding, as of 1 December 2011. [CLS] [SEP] Most of this was due to the manufacturing industry, as seven major industrial estates were inundated in water as much 3 meters (10 feet) deep during the floods. [CLS] [SEP] Disruptions to manufacturing supply chains affected regional automobile production and caused a global shortage of hard disk drives which lasted throughout 2012. [CLS] [SEP] The World Bank's estimate for this disaster means it ranks as the world's fourth costliest disaster as of 2011 surpassed only by the 2011 T≈çhoku earthquake and tsunami in Japan, Great Hanshin earthquake in 1995, Forest fires in 1997, Indian Ocean tsunami in 2004 and Hurricane Katrina in 2005. [CLS] [SEP] A 2015 study suggests increasing odds for potential flooding similar to the 2011 flood intensity to occur in the future.Thailand's southern provinces also saw seasonal flash-flooding towards the end of the year, although these were not as destructive as the floods in the more northerly provinces.
