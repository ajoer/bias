[CLS] Typhoon Rammasun, known in the Philippines as Typhoon Glenda, was one of the only two Category 5 super typhoons on record in the South China Sea, with the other one being Pamela in 1954. [SEP] [CLS] Rammasun had destructive impacts across the Philippines, South China, and Vietnam in July 2014. [SEP] [CLS] Rammasun is a Siamese word for thunder god. [SEP] [CLS] After Lingling and Kajiki earlier in 2014, Rammasun became the third tropical cyclone, and first typhoon to directly impact the Philippines in 2014. [SEP] [CLS] The ninth named storm and the third typhoon of the annual typhoon season, Rammasun formed in the Intertropical Convergence Zone, an area near the equator where the northeast and southeast trade winds come together, and slowly drifted northwest. [SEP] [CLS] Having passed through the islands of Micronesia, the system turned west and quickly moved under the influence of a subtropical ridge (STR). [SEP] [CLS] Rammasun posed a significant threat to the Philippine island of Luzon, as it was expected to reach typhoon intensity before making landfall there. [SEP] [CLS] Though initially forecast to make landfall in Cagayan Valley, the storm followed a more westerly path and was later forecast to make landfall in the Bicol Region and then pass through Bataan and Zambales before brushing past Metro Manila.In preparation for the storm, Governor of Guam Eddie Calvo declared the island in Condition of Readiness 3 and later upgraded it to Condition of Readiness 1. [SEP] [CLS] On July 11, NASA satellites revealed Rammasun passing directly over Guam. [SEP] [CLS] The American National Weather Service stated that an unexpected rise in wind shear kept the system from intensifying much further before reaching Guam. [SEP] [CLS] Rammasun only made landfall on Guam as a tropical depression, with winds much weaker than earlier anticipated. [SEP] [CLS] However, under the system, the island received a substantial amount of rainfall, making that day the wettest in around 3 months. [SEP] [CLS] The United States territory received 25 to 50 mm (1 to 2 inches) of rain. [SEP] [CLS] Along with the Philippines, Taiwan also expected impact from Rammasun. [SEP] [CLS] Moderate to heavy rainfall was predicted through most of the country. [SEP] [CLS] Chinese meteorologists were focusing on second and/or third landfalls in the Chinese Hainan province and northern Vietnam. [SEP] [CLS] Residents of Hong Kong were also warned of rainfall and subsequent landslides.Following the closure of maritime seaports, more than 100 passengers were reportedly stranded at the Port of Batangas, along with 39 rolling cargoes. [SEP] [CLS] Meanwhile, at least 841 passengers were stranded in five ports in the Bicol region, namely Matnog, Tabaco, Bulan, Cataingan and Pilar. [SEP] [CLS] A total 50 flights were cancelled and over 100 thousand families were evacuated as the typhoon neared landfall. [SEP] [CLS] The Philippine Department of Health said that they have prepared all government hospitals to aid the rescue and relief process during and after the typhoon. [SEP] [CLS] They claimed that they are much better prepared now, than they were for earlier typhoons. [SEP] [CLS] Ahead of the landfall, a city in the province of Albay had declared a state of calamity. [SEP] [CLS] At around 17:00 Philippine Standard Time (09:00 UTC), Rammasun's eye passed directly over Rapu-Rapu, Albay while the storm was at its initial peak intensity. [SEP] [CLS] Various parts of the National Capital Region reported power outages during the storm. [SEP] [CLS] They were reportedly caused by "a temporary system balance at 1:29 a.m. [SEP] [CLS] due to a sudden plant outage." Laguna is one of the badly hit by the typhoon At least 6,000 people were stranded at various seaports throughout the country due to the storm.Throughout its devastating journey through southern Luzon, the powerful typhoon barely weakened but instead maintained its strength and even intensified as it made its way across the Bicol Region.
