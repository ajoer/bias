Hurricane Odile is tied for the most intense landfalling tropical cyclone in the Baja California Peninsula during the satellite era and the seventh-most intense tropical cyclone worldwide in 2014. [CLS] [SEP] Sweeping across the peninsula in September 2014, Odile inflicted widespread damage, particularly in the state of Baja California Sur, in addition to causing lesser impacts on the Mexican mainland and Southwestern United States. [CLS] [SEP] The precursor to Odile developed into a tropical depression south of Mexico on September 10 and quickly reached tropical storm strength. [CLS] [SEP] After meandering for several days, Odile began to track northwestward, intensifying to hurricane status before rapidly reaching its Category 4 hurricane peak intensity on September 14. [CLS] [SEP] The cyclone slightly weakened before making landfall near Cabo San Lucas with winds of 125 mph (205 km/h). [CLS] [SEP] Odile gradually weakened as it tracked across the length of the Baja California Peninsula, briefly crossing into the Gulf of California before degenerating into a remnant system on September 17. [CLS] [SEP] These remnants tracked northeastward across the Southwestern United States before they were no longer identifiable on September 19. [CLS] [SEP] Initially, the National Hurricane Center (NHC) forecast that Odile would track westward and avoid land as it would curve out to sea. [CLS] [SEP] Accordingly, the local governments of southwestern Mexico initially posted minor weather alerts. [CLS] [SEP] Precautionary measures on the Baja California Peninsula began in earnest after Odile unexpectedly took a direct course towards the peninsula. [CLS] [SEP] Several municipalities declared a state of emergency, opening 164 shelters with a total capacity of 30,000 people. [CLS] [SEP] Due to the unanticipated threat of Odile, approximately 26,000 foreign tourists were stranded on the peninsula at the time of landfall. [CLS] [SEP] In Odile's developmental stage, its heavy rainfall and storm surge inflicted minor coastal damage across southwestern Mexico and three deaths in Oaxaca and Jalisco. [CLS] [SEP] The most significant storm impacts occurred on the Baja California Peninsula, where damages amounted to MXN$16.6 billion (US$1.25 billion). [CLS] [SEP] Power outages spurred by Odile's intense winds and rain cut electricity to 92% of the population of Baja California Sur. [CLS] [SEP] Severe flooding also occurred, causing rivers to swell and the mass evacuation of people out of hazardous low-lying areas. [CLS] [SEP] The remnants of Odile brought rains and unseasonably powerful thunderstorms to the southwestern United States. [CLS] [SEP] In total, Odile led to the deaths of 18 people throughout its nine-day existence. [CLS] [SEP]
