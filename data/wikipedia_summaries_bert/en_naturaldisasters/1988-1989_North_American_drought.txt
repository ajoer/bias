The North American Drought of 1988 ranks among the worst episodes of drought in the United States. [CLS] [SEP] This multi-year drought began in most areas in 1988 and continued into 1989 and 1990 (in certain areas). [CLS] [SEP] The drought caused $60 billion in damage ($130 billion in 2019 United States dollars, adjusting for inflation). [CLS] [SEP] The drought occasioned some of the worst blowing-dust events since 1977 or the 1930s in many locations in the Midwestern United States, including a protracted dust storm, which closed schools in South Dakota in late February 1988. [CLS] [SEP] During the spring, several weather stations set records for the lowest monthly total precipitation and the longest interval between measurable precipitation, for example, 55 days in a row without precipitation in Milwaukee. [CLS] [SEP] During the summer, two record-setting heatwaves developed, similar to those of 1934 and 1936. [CLS] [SEP] The concurrent heat waves killed 4,800 to 17,000 people in the United States. [CLS] [SEP] During the summer of 1988, the drought led to many wildfires in forested western North America, including the Yellowstone fires of 1988. [CLS] [SEP] At its peak, the drought covered 45% of the United States. [CLS] [SEP] While covering less area than the Dust Bowl, which covered 70% of the United States, the drought of 1988 ranks as not only the costliest drought in United States history but also one of the costliest natural disasters in United States history. [CLS] [SEP] In Canada, drought-related losses added to $1.8 billion (1988 Canadian dollars). [CLS] [SEP]
