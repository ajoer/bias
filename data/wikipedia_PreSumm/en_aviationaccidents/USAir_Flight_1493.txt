[CLS] On the evening of February 1, 1991, USAir Flight 1493, a Boeing 737-300, collided with SkyWest Flight 5569, a Metroliner turboprop aircraft, upon landing at Los Angeles International Airport. [SEP] [CLS] Though air traffic was not heavy at LAX, as Flight 1493 was on final approach the local controller was distracted by a series of abnormalities, including a misplaced flight progress strip and an aircraft that had inadvertently switched off the tower frequency. [SEP] [CLS] The SkyWest flight was told to taxi into takeoff position while the USAir flight was landing on the same runway. [SEP] [CLS] Upon landing, the 737 collided with the twin-engine turboprop, continued down the runway with the turboprop crushed beneath it, exited the runway, and caught fire. [SEP] [CLS] All 12 people aboard the smaller plane were killed, as well as an eventual total of 23 out of the 89 occupants of the Boeing. [SEP] [CLS] Rescue workers were on the scene of the fire within minutes and began the evacuation of the plane. [SEP] [CLS] Because of the intense fire, three of the 737's six exits could not be used. [SEP] [CLS] Neither of the front exits was usable, which caused the front passengers to try to use the overwing exits. [SEP] [CLS] However, only one of the overwing exits was usable, which caused a backlog to form. [SEP] [CLS] Most of those who died aboard the 737 succumbed to asphyxiation in the post-crash fire. [SEP] [CLS] The National Transportation Safety Board (NTSB) found that the probable cause of the accident was the procedures in use at the LAX control tower, which provided inadequate redundancy, leading to a loss of situational awareness by the local controller, and inadequate oversight of the Federal Aviation Administration (FAA) for failing to supervise the control tower managers. [SEP] [CLS] The crash led directly to the NTSB's recommendation of using different runways for takeoffs and landings at LAX. [SEP] [CLS]
