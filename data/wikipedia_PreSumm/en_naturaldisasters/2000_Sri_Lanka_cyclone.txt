[CLS] The 2000 Sri Lanka cyclone (IMD designation: BOB 06 JTWC designation: 04B) was the strongest tropical cyclone to strike Sri Lanka since 1978. [SEP] [CLS] The fourth tropical storm and the second severe cyclonic storm of the 2000 North Indian Ocean cyclone season, it developed from an area of disturbed weather on December 25, 2000. [SEP] [CLS] It moved westward, and quickly strengthened under favorable conditions to reach top wind speeds of 75 mph (120 km/h). [SEP] [CLS] The cyclone hit eastern Sri Lanka at peak strength, then weakened slightly while crossing the island before making landfall over southern India on December 28. [SEP] [CLS] The storm degenerated into a remnant low later that day, before merging with another trough on the next day. [SEP] [CLS] The storm was the first cyclone over Sri Lanka with winds of at least hurricane strength since a 110 mph (175 km/h) cyclone hit in the 1978 season, as well as the first tropical storm to hit the island since 1992. [SEP] [CLS] The storm was also the first December tropical cyclone of hurricane intensity in the Bay of Bengal since 1996. [SEP] [CLS] It was reportedly passable on foot until the 15th century, when storms deepened the channel: temple records seem to say that Adam's Bridge was completely above sea level until it broke in a cyclone in 1480. [SEP] [CLS] It produced heavy rainfall and strong winds, damaging or destroying tens of thousands of houses and leaving up to 500,000 homeless.
