Northwest Orient Airlines Flight 706 was a Lockheed L-188 Electra aircraft, registration N137US, which crashed on take-off from Chicago's O'Hare International Airport September 17, 1961. [CLS] [SEP] All 37 on board were killed in the accident. [CLS] [SEP] Flight 706 began its day in Milwaukee, Wisconsin, and was scheduled to stop at Chicago before travelling to Tampa, Fort Lauderdale, and Miami, Florida. [CLS] [SEP] It arrived at Chicago in the early morning and left soon afterwards, being cleared for takeoff at 8:55 AM. [CLS] [SEP] Takeoff was normal until the aircraft reached the altitude of 100 feet above ground level, when witnesses noticed a slight change in the sound of the Electra's engines. [CLS] [SEP] The aircraft began a gentle bank to the right as the starboard wing began to drop. [CLS] [SEP] The bank angle increased to 35°; at that point the tower controllers picked up a garbled broadcast believed to be from the pilots. [CLS] [SEP] The aircraft climbed to approximately 300 feet but continued to bank, eventually reaching a bank angle of over 50°. [CLS] [SEP] At that point, the starboard wing nicked a series of high-tension power lines running along the south boundary of the airport; shortly after that, the aircraft struck an embankment and cartwheeled onto its nose. [CLS] [SEP] The forward fuselage broke off, the plane pancaked and skidded, then launched into the air and slammed nose-first into the ground, falling over on its back and exploding into a ball of flame. [CLS] [SEP] The accident took less than two minutes from the beginning of takeoff until the final crash. [CLS] [SEP] Investigators with the Civil Aeronautics Board determined that the cable physically connecting the first officer's control wheel to the aileron boost unit had disconnected. [CLS] [SEP] This had caused the ailerons to put the aircraft in a starboard-wing-down attitude, and had prevented the pilots from being able to correct the bank. [CLS] [SEP] The cables attaching the pilots' control wheels to the aileron boost unit had been removed two months before the accident during routine maintenance; a safety cable that held part of the assembly together had not been replaced when the cables were hooked back up. [CLS] [SEP] The contact slowly separated, until it completely failed during the takeoff sequence. [CLS] [SEP]
