Rigord (Rigordus) (c. [CLS] [SEP] 1150 – c. [CLS] [SEP] 1209) was a French chronicler, was probably born near Alais in Languedoc, and became a physician. [CLS] [SEP] After becoming a monk he entered the monastery of Argenteuil, and then that of Saint-Denis, and described himself as "regis Francorum chronographus". [CLS] [SEP] Rigord wrote the Gesta Philippi Augusti, dealing with the life of the French king, Philip Augustus, from his coronation in 1179 until 1206. [CLS] [SEP] The work, which is very valuable, was abridged and continued by William the Breton. [CLS] [SEP] The earlier part of the Gesta speaks of the king in very laudatory terms, but in the latter part it is much less flattering in its tone. [CLS] [SEP] The Gesta is published in tome xvii of Dom Martin Bouquet's Recueil des historiens des Gaules et de la France (Paris, 1738–1876); and with introduction by HF Delaborde (Paris, 1882–85). [CLS] [SEP] A French translation of the Gesta is in tome xi of Guizot's Collection des mémoires relatifs à l'histoire de France (Paris, 1825). [CLS] [SEP] Rigord also wrote a short chronicle of the kings of France. [CLS] [SEP]
