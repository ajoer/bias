[CLS] Heinrich Schmid (6 April 1921 – 23 February 1999) was a Swiss linguist and "father" of the Rhaeto-Romance Dachsprachen ("umbrella languages") Rumantsch Grischun and Ladin Dolomitan. [SEP] [CLS] Heinrich Schmid lived his entire life in the same house in Zürich in which he was born. [SEP] [CLS] Although he was born with a hearing impairment, he discovered a love for languages at a young age learning Greek alongside Latin and the Romance languages French, Italian, Spanish and the different varieties of Romansh. [SEP] [CLS] After matriculating, he read Romance studies at the University of Zürich. [SEP] [CLS] He graduated with first class honours (summa cum laude) in 1946, the core theme of his studies being the History of Languages and the Geography of Languages. [SEP] [CLS] After a stay in Florence he returned to Switzerland where it was very difficult for him to find a suitable occupation due to his hearing impairment. [SEP] [CLS] He was eventually taken on as an employee for the Rhätisches Namenbuch (Rhaetian Lexicon of Names) and contributed for 15 years to the Dicziunari Rumantsch Grischun. [SEP] [CLS] In 1962 he qualified to work as professor at the University of Zürich. [SEP] [CLS] Within a short period of time he became an assistant professor and three years later was promoted to an associate professor position. [SEP] [CLS] A busy but less spectacular academic career followed. [SEP] [CLS] Shortly before retiring from his teaching career in 1983, the Lia Rumantscha (Romansh League) asked him to create a common written language for the five main varieties of the Romansh language. [SEP] [CLS] In April 1982, after only six months of intense work, he presented his guidelines for the common written language. [SEP] [CLS] This was followed by lively discussions and journeys to the whole Romansh language area, where he tirelessly promoted the common written language and was able to allay many reservations. [SEP] [CLS] As a result, the Romansh language has been publicly recognised to a much greater extent in Switzerland and a new vitality entered the Romansh-speaking area which also included Ladin. [SEP] [CLS] In 1988 representatives from the Dolomite Ladins gave Heinrich Schmid the task of also creating a common written format of the Ladin language. [SEP] [CLS] Schmid accepted this challenge and produced the publication entitled Wegleitung für den Aufbau einer gemeinsamen Schriftsprache der Dolomitenladiner (Guidelines for the Development of a Common Written Language for the Dolomite Ladins). [SEP] [CLS] However, he did not live to see the Italian publication of this fundamental work, as he died of a heart attack in February 1999. [SEP] [CLS]
