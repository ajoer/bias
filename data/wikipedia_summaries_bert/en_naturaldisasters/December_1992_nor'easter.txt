The December 1992 nor'easter produced record high tides and snowfall across the northeastern United States. [CLS] [SEP] It developed as a low pressure area on December 10 over Virginia, and for two days it remained over the Mid-Atlantic states before moving offshore. [CLS] [SEP] In Maryland, the snowfall unofficially reached 48 in (1,200 mm); if verified, the total would have been the highest in the state's history. [CLS] [SEP] About 120,000 people were left without power in the state due to high winds. [CLS] [SEP] Along the Maryland coast, the storm was less severe than the Perfect Storm in the previous year, although the strongest portion of the storm remained over New Jersey for several days. [CLS] [SEP] In the state, winds reached 80 mph (130 km/h) in Cape May, and tides peaked at 10.4 ft (3.2 m) in Perth Amboy. [CLS] [SEP] The combination of high tides and 25 ft (7.6 m) waves caused the most significant flooding in the state since the Ash Wednesday Storm of 1962. [CLS] [SEP] Several highways and portions of the New York City Subway and Port Authority Trans-Hudson systems were closed due to the storm. [CLS] [SEP] Throughout New Jersey, the nor'easter damaged about 3,200 homes and caused an estimated $750 million in damage (1992 USD). [CLS] [SEP] The nor'easter increased tides across the northeastern United States for several days due to its slow movement. [CLS] [SEP] In New York City, tides reached 8.04 ft (2.45 m) at Battery Park, which flooded Franklin D. [CLS] [SEP] Roosevelt East River Drive. [CLS] [SEP] Along Long Island, the nor'easter destroyed over 130 homes and left 454,000 people without power. [CLS] [SEP] In New England, 230,684 people lost power during the storm. [CLS] [SEP] Five houses were destroyed in Massachusetts, and flooding reached 5 ft (1.5 m) deep in Boston. [CLS] [SEP] Further inland, the storm produced significant snowfall, estimated at around 4 ft (1.2 m) in The Berkshires. [CLS] [SEP] The high snow totals closed schools for a week in western Massachusetts. [CLS] [SEP] Overall, the storm caused between $1â€“2 billion in damage (1992 USD) and 19 deaths, of which four were directly related to the storm. [CLS] [SEP] In March of the following year, the Storm of the Century caused worse damage across a larger region of the eastern United States. [CLS] [SEP]
