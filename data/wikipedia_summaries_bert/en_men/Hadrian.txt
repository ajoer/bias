Hadrian (; Latin: Caesar Publius Aelius Traianus Hadrianus; 24 January 76 â€“ 10 July 138) was Roman emperor from 117 to 138. [CLS] [SEP] He was born into a Roman Italo-Hispanic family that settled in Spain from the Italian city of Atri in Picenum. [CLS] [SEP] His father was of senatorial rank and was a first cousin of Emperor Trajan. [CLS] [SEP] He married Trajan's grand-niece Vibia Sabina early in his career, before Trajan became emperor and possibly at the behest of Trajan's wife Pompeia Plotina. [CLS] [SEP] Plotina and Trajan's close friend and adviser Lucius Licinius Sura were well disposed towards Hadrian. [CLS] [SEP] When Trajan died, his widow claimed that he had nominated Hadrian as emperor immediately before his death. [CLS] [SEP] Rome's military and Senate approved Hadrian's succession, but four leading senators were unlawfully put to death soon after. [CLS] [SEP] They had opposed Hadrian or seemed to threaten his succession, and the senate held him responsible for it and never forgave him. [CLS] [SEP] He earned further disapproval among the elite by abandoning Trajan's expansionist policies and territorial gains in Mesopotamia, Assyria, Armenia, and parts of Dacia. [CLS] [SEP] Hadrian preferred to invest in the development of stable, defensible borders and the unification of the empire's disparate peoples. [CLS] [SEP] He is known for building Hadrian's Wall, which marked the northern limit of Britannia. [CLS] [SEP] Hadrian energetically pursued his own Imperial ideals and personal interests. [CLS] [SEP] He visited almost every province of the Empire, accompanied by an Imperial retinue of specialists and administrators. [CLS] [SEP] He encouraged military preparedness and discipline, and he fostered, designed, or personally subsidised various civil and religious institutions and building projects. [CLS] [SEP] In Rome itself, he rebuilt the Pantheon and constructed the vast Temple of Venus and Roma. [CLS] [SEP] In Egypt, he may have rebuilt the Serapeum of Alexandria. [CLS] [SEP] He was an ardent admirer of Greece and sought to make Athens the cultural capital of the Empire, so he ordered the construction of many opulent temples there. [CLS] [SEP] His intense relationship with Greek youth Antinous and the latter's untimely death led Hadrian to establish a widespread cult late in his reign. [CLS] [SEP] He suppressed the Bar Kokhba revolt in Judaea, but his reign was otherwise peaceful. [CLS] [SEP] Hadrian's last years were marred by chronic illness. [CLS] [SEP] He saw the Bar Kokhba revolt as the failure of his panhellenic ideal. [CLS] [SEP] He executed two more senators for their alleged plots against him, and this provoked further resentment. [CLS] [SEP] His marriage to Vibia Sabina had been unhappy and childless; he adopted Antoninus Pius in 138 and nominated him as a successor, on the condition that Antoninus adopt Marcus Aurelius and Lucius Verus as his own heirs. [CLS] [SEP] Hadrian died the same year at Baiae, and Antoninus had him deified, despite opposition from the Senate. [CLS] [SEP] Edward Gibbon includes him among the Empire's "Five Good Emperors", a "benevolent dictator"; Hadrian's own senate found him remote and authoritarian. [CLS] [SEP] He has been described as enigmatic and contradictory, with a capacity for both great personal generosity and extreme cruelty and driven by insatiable curiosity, self-conceit, and ambition.
