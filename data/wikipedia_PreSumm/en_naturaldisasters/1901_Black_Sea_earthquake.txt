[CLS] The 1901 Black Sea earthquake (also known in Bulgaria as Balchik earthquake) was a 7.2 magnitude earthquake, the most powerful earthquake ever recorded in the Black Sea. [SEP] [CLS] The earthquake epicenter was located in the east of Cape Kaliakra, 30 kilometres (19 mi) off northeast coast of Bulgaria. [SEP] [CLS] The mainshock occurred at a depth of 15 km (9.3 mi) and generated a 4–5-metre (13–16 ft) high tsunami that devastated the coastal areas of Romania and Bulgaria. [SEP] [CLS] In Romania, the earthquake was felt not only throughout Northern Dobruja, but also in Oltenia and Muntenia, and even in southern Moldova. [SEP] [CLS] The earthquake was followed by a large number of local replicas and secondary earthquakes, which continued until 1905; the strongest aftershocks reached magnitudes of 5.5–6.0 on the Richter scale and were also felt in southern Romania, including Bucharest. [SEP] [CLS] After 1905, Pontic seismic activity began to subside, although weak and moderate earthquakes were also reported in subsequent years. [SEP] [CLS] Such events are rare in the Black Sea. [SEP] [CLS] In the last 200 years, in the Black Sea region 24 tsunamis occurred, of which two were in the territory of Dobruja. [SEP] [CLS] The earliest recorded tsunami in Romania dates from 104, when the city of Callatis, current Mangalia, was badly affected. [SEP] [CLS]
