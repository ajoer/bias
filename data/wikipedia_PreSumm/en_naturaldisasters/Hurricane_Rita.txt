[CLS] Hurricane Rita was the most intense tropical cyclone on record in the Gulf of Mexico beating Hurricane Katrina and the fourth-most intense Atlantic hurricane ever recorded. [SEP] [CLS] Part of the record-breaking 2005 Atlantic hurricane season, which included three of the top ten most intense Atlantic hurricanes ever recorded (along with #1 Wilma and #7 Katrina), Rita was the seventeenth named storm, tenth hurricane, and fifth major hurricane of the 2005 season. [SEP] [CLS] Rita formed near The Bahamas from a tropical wave on September 18, 2005 that originally developed off the coast of West Africa. [SEP] [CLS] It moved westward, and after passing through the Florida Straits, Rita entered an environment of abnormally warm waters. [SEP] [CLS] Moving west-northwest, it rapidly intensified to reach peak winds of 180 mph (285 km/h), achieving Category 5 status on September 21st. [SEP] [CLS] However, it weakened to a Category 3 hurricane before making landfall in Johnson's Bayou, Louisiana, between Sabine Pass, Texas and Holly Beach, Louisiana, with winds of 115 mph (185 km/h). [SEP] [CLS] Rapidly weakening over land, Rita degenerated into a large low-pressure area over the lower Mississippi Valley by September 26th. [SEP] [CLS] In Louisiana, Rita's storm surge inundated low-lying communities along the entire coast, worsening effects caused by Hurricane Katrina less than a month prior, such as topping the hurriedly-repaired Katrina-damaged levees at New Orleans. [SEP] [CLS] Parishes in Southwest Louisiana and counties in Southeast Texas where Rita made landfall suffered from severe to catastrophic flooding and wind damage. [SEP] [CLS] According to an October 25, 2005 Disaster Center report, 4,526 single-family dwellings were destroyed in Orange and Jefferson counties located in Southeast Texas. [SEP] [CLS] Major damage was sustained by 14,256 additional single-family dwellings, and another 26,211 single-family dwellings received minor damage. [SEP] [CLS] Mobile homes and apartments also sustained significant damage or total destruction. [SEP] [CLS] In all, nine Texas counties and five Louisiana Parishes were declared disaster areas after the storm. [SEP] [CLS] Electric service was disrupted in some areas of both Texas and Louisiana for several weeks. [SEP] [CLS] Texas reported the most deaths from the hurricane, where 113 deaths were reported, 107 of which were associated with the evacuation of the Houston metropolitan area. [SEP] [CLS] Moderate to severe damage was reported across the lower Mississippi Valley. [SEP] [CLS] Rainfall from the storm and its associated remnants extended from Louisiana to Michigan. [SEP] [CLS] Rainfall peaked at 16.00 in (406 mm) in Central Louisiana. [SEP] [CLS] Several tornadoes were also associated with the hurricane and its subsequent remnants. [SEP] [CLS] Throughout the path of Rita, damage totaled about $18.5 billion (2005 USD). [SEP] [CLS] As many as 120 deaths in four U.S. [SEP] [CLS] states were directly related to the hurricane.
