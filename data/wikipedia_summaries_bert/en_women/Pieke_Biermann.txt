[CLS] Nazi analogies or Nazi comparisons are any comparisons or parallels which are related to Nazism or Nazi Germany, which often reference Adolf Hitler, Joseph Goebbels, the SS, or the Holocaust. [SEP] [CLS] Despite criticism, such comparisons have been employed for a wide variety of reasons since Hitler's rise to power. [SEP] [CLS] Some Nazi comparisons are logical fallacies, such as reductio ad Hitlerum. [SEP] [CLS] Godwin's law asserts that a Nazi analogy is increasingly likely the longer an internet discussion continues, though Mike Godwin also noted that not all Nazi comparisons are invalid.
