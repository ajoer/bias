[CLS] Invicta International Airlines Flight 435 (IM435) was a Vickers Vanguard 952, flying from Bristol Lulsgate to Basel-Mulhouse, which crashed into a forested hillside near Hochwald, Switzerland on 10 April 1973. [SEP] [CLS] The aircraft somersaulted and broke up, killing 108 people, with 37 survivors. [SEP] [CLS] To date, this is the deadliest accident involving a Vickers Vanguard and the deadliest aviation accident to occur on Swiss soil. [SEP] [CLS] Many of the 139 passengers on the charter flight were women, members of the Axbridge Ladies Guild, from the Somerset towns and villages of Axbridge, Cheddar, Winscombe and Congresbury. [SEP] [CLS] The accident left 55 children motherless.Pilot Anthony Dorman became disoriented, misidentifying two radio beacons and missing another. [SEP] [CLS] When co-pilot Ivor Terry took over, his final approach was based on the wrong beacon and the aircraft crashed into the hillside. [SEP] [CLS] Dorman had previously been suspended from the Royal Canadian Air Force for lack of ability, and had failed his United Kingdom instrument flight rating test eight times. [SEP] [CLS] As a result of the crash tougher regulations were introduced in the UK. [SEP] [CLS] Despite the conclusions of the official Swiss report, one commentator, ex-KLM pilot Jan Bartelski, has argued that the pilots may not have been entirely to blame and that there is a possibility that they were led off course by "ghost" beacon transmissions caused by electric power lines.
