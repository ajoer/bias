[CLS] An aurora (plural: auroras or aurorae), sometimes referred to as polar lights, northern lights (aurora borealis), or southern lights (aurora australis), is a natural light display in the Earth's sky, predominantly seen in the high-latitude regions (around the Arctic and Antarctic). [SEP] [CLS] Auroras are the result of disturbances in the magnetosphere caused by solar wind. [SEP] [CLS] These disturbances are sometimes strong enough to alter the trajectories of charged particles in both solar wind and magnetospheric plasma. [SEP] [CLS] These particles, mainly electrons and protons, precipitate into the upper atmosphere (thermosphere/exosphere). [SEP] [CLS] The resulting ionization and excitation of atmospheric constituents emit light of varying color and complexity. [SEP] [CLS] The form of the aurora, occurring within bands around both polar regions, is also dependent on the amount of acceleration imparted to the precipitating particles. [SEP] [CLS] Precipitating protons generally produce optical emissions as incident hydrogen atoms after gaining electrons from the atmosphere. [SEP] [CLS] Proton auroras are usually observed at lower latitudes. [SEP] [CLS]
