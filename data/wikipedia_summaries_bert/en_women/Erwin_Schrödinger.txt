Erwin Rudolf Josef Alexander Schrödinger (UK: , US: ; German: [ˈɛɐ̯viːn ˈʃʁøːdɪŋɐ]; 12 August 1887 – 4 January 1961), sometimes written as Erwin Schrodinger or Erwin Schroedinger, was a Nobel Prize-winning Austrian-Irish physicist who developed a number of fundamental results in quantum theory: the Schrödinger equation provides a way to calculate the wave function of a system and how it changes dynamically in time. [CLS] [SEP] In addition, he was the author of many works on various aspects of physics: statistical mechanics and thermodynamics, physics of dielectrics, colour theory, electrodynamics, general relativity, and cosmology, and he made several attempts to construct a unified field theory. [CLS] [SEP] In his book What Is Life? [CLS] [SEP] Schrödinger addressed the problems of genetics, looking at the phenomenon of life from the point of view of physics. [CLS] [SEP] He paid great attention to the philosophical aspects of science, ancient and oriental philosophical concepts, ethics, and religion. [CLS] [SEP] He also wrote on philosophy and theoretical biology. [CLS] [SEP] He is also known for his "Schrödinger's cat" thought-experiment. [CLS] [SEP]
