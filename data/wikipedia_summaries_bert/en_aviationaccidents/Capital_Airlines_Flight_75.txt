[CLS] Capital Airlines Flight 75 was a domestic scheduled Capital Airlines passenger flight between La Guardia Airport and Hartsfield-Jackson Atlanta International Airport in Atlanta, Georgia. [SEP] [CLS] A Vickers Viscount flying the route crashed in Chase, Maryland, on May 12, 1959, with the loss of all on board. [SEP] [CLS] The crash was the third of four involving a Capital Airlines Vickers Viscount in less than two years; the other three were Capital Airlines Flight 67 (April 1958), Capital Airlines Flight 300 (May 1958), and Capital Airlines Flight 20 (January 1960). [SEP] [CLS] The flight left the terminal at La Guardia at 3:20 in the afternoon, 20 minutes behind schedule, and took off at 3:29. [SEP] [CLS] It then climbed to 14,000 feet before coming onto the assigned airway, Victor 3. [SEP] [CLS] At 4:02, the crew contacted Washington Center, reporting over Westchester, and estimating Westminster to be fifteen minutes away. [SEP] [CLS] In the same message, they noted that there were thunderstorms along the assigned course, and requested permission to navigate clear of the weather a little south of Westminster. [SEP] [CLS] The air traffic controller acknowledged the message and gave the go-ahead. [SEP] [CLS] At 4:10 the flight called again, the pilots noting that they had slowed somewhat to account for turbulence. [SEP] [CLS] This was the last message sent by the flight crew; three minutes later, the plane entered an area of severe turbulence, lost control, and entered a steep descent. [SEP] [CLS] It is believed that the craft reached an airspeed of 335 knots, fully 15 percent more than the Viscount's never exceed speed, and about 5 percent in excess of the maximum speed demonstrated when the plane was certified. [SEP] [CLS] Consequently, at about 5000 feet both of the horizontal stabilizers failed at once, separating downward. [SEP] [CLS] The separation caused the plane to pitch violently nose-down; the gyroscopic loads combined with inertia to cause all four engine nacelles to break upward. [SEP] [CLS] Both wings were then subjected to extreme downloads. [SEP] [CLS] Under the pressure, the right wing separated, and the integrity of the left was completely destroyed. [SEP] [CLS] With so much of the aircraft's superstructure gone, the left wing induced drag on the fuselage, yawing it violently to the left. [SEP] [CLS] More forces from that direction tore off the vertical stabilizer, which came away with portions of the fuselage, already weakened from losing the left stabilizer. [SEP] [CLS] Further gyrations caused the left wing to disintegrate, opening its fuel tanks and leading to a flash fire. [SEP] [CLS] What was left of the fuselage crumbled, and the craft plunged to the ground. [SEP] [CLS] The cause of the accident was determined to be a loss of control of the plane in turbulence, resulting in an involuntary steep descent which created aerodynamic loads in excess of those for which the craft had been designed.
