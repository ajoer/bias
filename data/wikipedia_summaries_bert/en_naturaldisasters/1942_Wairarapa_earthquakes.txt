Two 1942 Wairarapa earthquakes shook the lower North Island of New Zealand; on 24 June and 2 August. [CLS] [SEP] They were large and shallow with the epicentres close together east of Masterton in the Wairarapa region. [CLS] [SEP] The June earthquake was sometimes referred to as the Masterton earthquake but both caused damage over a wide area, from Dannevirke and Eketahuna over to Whanganui and down to Otaki and Wellington. [CLS] [SEP] There was one death in Wellington, on 24 June. [CLS] [SEP] The August earthquake can be regarded as an aftershock of the June earthquake. [CLS] [SEP] Both earthquakes were preceded by smaller foreshocks. [CLS] [SEP] As the second quake was slightly less in magnitude than the first, they were not an earthquake doublet where the second shake is slightly larger. [CLS] [SEP] The August earthquake was considerably deeper (40 km, not 12 km), though another source gives the depths as 43 km and 15 km. [CLS] [SEP] There was a further large aftershock on 2 December and another in February 1943. [CLS] [SEP]
