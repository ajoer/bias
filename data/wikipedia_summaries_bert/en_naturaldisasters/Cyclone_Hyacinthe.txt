[CLS] Tropical Cyclone Hyacinthe was the wettest tropical cyclone on record worldwide. [SEP] [CLS] The eighth named storm of the season, Hyacinthe formed on January 15, 1980, to the northeast of Mauritius in the southern Indian Ocean. [SEP] [CLS] Initially it moved to the west-southwest, and while slowly intensifying it passed north of the French overseas department of Réunion. [SEP] [CLS] On January 19, Météo-France estimated that the storm had intensified to a tropical cyclone. [SEP] [CLS] Hyacinthe looped to the south of eastern Madagascar and weakened, although it restrengthened after turning to the east. [SEP] [CLS] The storm executed another loop to the southwest of Réunion, passing near the island for a second and later third time. [SEP] [CLS] Hyacinthe became extratropical on January 29 after turning southward, dissipating two days later. [SEP] [CLS] For twelve days, Hyacinthe dropped torrential rainfall on Réunion; nearly all of the island received more than 1 m (3.3 ft) of precipitation. [SEP] [CLS] Over a 15‑day period from January 14 to January 28, 6,083 mm (239.5 in) of rainfall were recorded at Commerson Crater, a volcano caldera. [SEP] [CLS] The heaviest rainfall occurred through a process called orographic lift in the mountainous interior, leading to hundreds of landslides. [SEP] [CLS] Widespread floods damaged half the roads on Réunion and isolated three villages. [SEP] [CLS] Hyacinthe caused heavy damage to crops and damaged or destroyed 2,000 houses. [SEP] [CLS] Losses from the storm totaled $167 million (1980 USD, 676 million francs), and 25 people were killed. [SEP] [CLS]
