[CLS] Tropical Depression Eight caused severe flooding in southeastern Texas in late August 1981. [SEP] [CLS] The eighth tropical cyclone of the annual hurricane season, the depression developed from a tropical disturbance over the Bay of Campeche on August 26. [SEP] [CLS] Moving northwestward, the cyclone failed to intensify into a tropical storm before making landfall in the Mexican state of Tamaulipas to the north of Tampico on August 28, with winds of 35 mph (55 km/h). [SEP] [CLS] After moving inland, the depression curved north-northwestward before degenerating into a surface low pressure area near the Mexicoâ€“United States border on August 29. [SEP] [CLS] The remnants moved eastward across Texas and entered Louisiana before dissipating on September 1. [SEP] [CLS] Although the system was only a surface low upon reaching Texas, a large thunderstorm complex developed near its center on August 29. [SEP] [CLS] This resulted in heavy rainfall across southeastern Texas, with a peak total of 21 in (530 mm) in Pine Springs, with much of that falling in only about six hours. [SEP] [CLS] One of the hardest hit areas was Lavaca County. [SEP] [CLS] At least 15 streets in downtown Hallettsville were flooded, damaging hundreds of cars, 150 to 200 homes, 75 businesses, and a few local government buildings. [SEP] [CLS] Five people were killed by floodwaters in Shiner. [SEP] [CLS] Throughout Lavaca County, more than 286 homes were damaged or destroyed, 17 bridges and several roads were washed out, and hundreds of head of cattle were lost. [SEP] [CLS] The depression spawned 14 tornadoes, one of which caused extensive damage in the Galveston area.
