[CLS] Emperor An of Jin (simplified Chinese: 晋安帝; traditional Chinese: 晉安帝; pinyin: Jìn Ān Dì; Wade–Giles: Chin An-ti; 382–419), personal name Sima Dezong (司馬德宗), was an emperor of the Eastern Jin Dynasty (265-420) in China. [SEP] [CLS] He was described as so developmentally disabled that he was unable to speak, clothe himself, or be able to express whether he was hungry or full. [SEP] [CLS] He was created crown prince in 387 and ascended the throne in 397. [SEP] [CLS] Because of his disability, the actual power was controlled by his uncle, Sima Daozi, Prince of Kuaiji. [SEP] [CLS] During his reign, regents and warlords dominated the Jin regime. [SEP] [CLS] Revolts by various governors also ravaged the land. [SEP] [CLS] From 398 to 403, there were constant revolts and civil war campaigns. [SEP] [CLS] In 403, the Jin regime was usurped by the warlord Huan Xuan, and while Emperor An was restored in 404, the Jin Dynasty was nearing its end. [SEP] [CLS] With the warlord Liu Yu as the actual power, Jin destroyed Southern Yan and Later Qin, greatly expanding its territory. [SEP] [CLS] However, with Liu Yu up in the north, the renegade governor of Guang Province (廣州, modern Guangdong and Guangxi), Lu Xun, rebelled and threatened the capital city Jiankang, before Liu Yu returned and crushed the revolt. [SEP] [CLS] In 419, Emperor An was strangled under the order of Liu Yu and replaced with his brother Emperor Gong, who would be the last emperor of the dynasty, before Liu Yu would take the throne and establish the Liu Song Dynasty.
