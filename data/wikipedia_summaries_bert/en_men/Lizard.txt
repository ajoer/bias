[CLS] Lizards are a widespread group of squamate reptiles, with over 6,000 species, ranging across all continents except Antarctica, as well as most oceanic island chains. [SEP] [CLS] The group is paraphyletic as it excludes the snakes and Amphisbaenia; some lizards are more closely related to these two excluded groups than they are to other lizards. [SEP] [CLS] Lizards range in size from chameleons and geckos a few centimeters long to the 3 meter long Komodo dragon. [SEP] [CLS] Most lizards are quadrupedal, running with a strong side-to-side motion. [SEP] [CLS] Others are legless, and have long snake-like bodies. [SEP] [CLS] Some such as the forest-dwelling Draco lizards are able to glide. [SEP] [CLS] They are often territorial, the males fighting off other males and signalling, often with brightly colours, to attract mates and to intimidate rivals. [SEP] [CLS] Lizards are mainly carnivorous, often being sit-and-wait predators; many smaller species eat insects, while the Komodo eats mammals as big as water buffalo. [SEP] [CLS] Lizards make use of a variety of antipredator adaptations, including venom, camouflage, reflex bleeding, and the ability to sacrifice and regrow their tails. [SEP] [CLS]
