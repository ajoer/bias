[CLS] Severe Tropical Cyclone Waka (Fiji Meteorological Service designation: 03F, Joint Typhoon Warning Center designation: 07P) was one of the most destructive tropical cyclones ever to affect the South Pacific Kingdom of Tonga. [SEP] [CLS] Waka originated within the near-equatorial trough in mid-December 2001, although the system remained disorganized for more than a week. [SEP] [CLS] The storm gradually matured and attained tropical cyclone status on December 29. [SEP] [CLS] Subsequently, Waka underwent rapid intensification in which it attained its peak intensity as a Category 4 severe tropical cyclone (Australian tropical cyclone intensity scale) on December 31, with winds of 185 km/h (115 mph). [SEP] [CLS] Shortly thereafter, it passed directly over Vavaʻu, Tonga, resulting in widespread damage. [SEP] [CLS] By January 1, 2002, the cyclone began to weaken as it underwent an extratropical transition. [SEP] [CLS] The remnants of Waka persisted for several more days and were last observed near the Southern Ocean on January 6. [SEP] [CLS] Although the storm affected several countries along its path, Waka left the most significant losses in Tonga, where it killed one person and wrought 104.2 million paʻanga ($51.3 million USD) in damage. [SEP] [CLS] Hundreds of structures, including 200 in the island's largest city, and much of the nation's agriculture were destroyed. [SEP] [CLS] Winds in excess of 185 km/h (115 mph) battered Vava'u, defoliating nearly every tree on the island. [SEP] [CLS] In addition to infrastructural and public losses, the environment was also severely affected; a native species of bat lost roughly 80% of its population due to the lack of fruit. [SEP] [CLS] Following the storm, Tonga requested international aid to cope with the scale of damage. [SEP] [CLS] Due to the severity of damage, the name Waka was later retired and replaced with Wiki. [SEP] [CLS] According to a study by Janet Franklin et al., storms similar in intensity to Waka, on average, strike Tonga once every 33 years. [SEP] [CLS]
