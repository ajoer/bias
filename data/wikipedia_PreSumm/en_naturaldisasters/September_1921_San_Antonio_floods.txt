[CLS] In early September 1921, the remnants of a Category 1 hurricane brought damaging floods to areas of Mexico and the U.S. [SEP] [CLS] state of Texas, particularly in the San Antonio region. [SEP] [CLS] On September 4, a tropical cyclone developed in the southwestern Gulf of Mexico near the Bay of Campeche. [SEP] [CLS] Moving slowly in a general westward direction, the disturbance reached hurricane intensity on September 7 prior to making landfall south of Tampico, Mexico the following day. [SEP] [CLS] The storm weakened over land, and lost cyclonic characteristics later that day. [SEP] [CLS] However, a nearby high-pressure area forced the remnants of the system northward into Texas. [SEP] [CLS] Due to an orographic lifting effect, the remnants were able to produce torrential and record rainfall over the state. [SEP] [CLS] Precipitation peaked over Central Texas, where the highest rainfall amount measured was 40 in (1,016 mm) near Thrall, Texas; this was the fourth-highest tropical cyclone-related rainfall total in Texas since record keeping began. [SEP] [CLS] Similarly, an observation of 36.40 in (925 mm) elsewhere in Williamson County, Texas ranked as the sixth-highest tropical cyclone-related rainfall total for the state. [SEP] [CLS] The high precipitation totals set nationwide records which would stand for several years. [SEP] [CLS]
