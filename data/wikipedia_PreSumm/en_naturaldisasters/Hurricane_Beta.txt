[CLS] Hurricane Beta was a compact and intense tropical cyclone that impacted the southwestern Caribbean in late October 2005. [SEP] [CLS] Beta was the twenty-fourth tropical storm, fourteenth hurricane, and seventh and final major hurricane of the record-breaking 2005 Atlantic hurricane season. [SEP] [CLS] On October 21, a developing tropical wave entered the eastern Caribbean Sea and spawned Tropical Storm Alpha the following day. [SEP] [CLS] As the wave entered the southwestern Caribbean, convection redeveloped and on October 26, the system spawned another low-pressure area which developed into Tropical Depression Twenty-six. [SEP] [CLS] The depression intensified into a tropical storm the next morning and was named Beta. [SEP] [CLS] By the morning of October 28, the storm intensified into a hurricane, the fourteenth of the season. [SEP] [CLS] Beta underwent rapid intensification for several hours to attain its peak intensity with winds of 115 mph (185 km/h) on October 30. [SEP] [CLS] The storm began to deteriorate before landfall, weakening to Category 2 status as it crossed the Nicaraguan coastline. [SEP] [CLS] Rapid weakening followed landfall, and the storm dissipated early the next morning. [SEP] [CLS] Due to the storm's proximity to Central America, several countries were placed on alert and began allocating supplies for a potential disaster. [SEP] [CLS] Several hurricane watches and warnings were raised for the small Colombian island of Providencia as well as the Nicaragua and Honduras coastlines. [SEP] [CLS] An estimated 150,000 people were evacuated from dangerous regions in Nicaragua and more than 125,000 more were evacuated in Honduras. [SEP] [CLS] As a tropical storm, Beta produced heavy rains over northern Panama, amounting up to 3 inches (76 mm), which caused several mudslides as well as three fatalities. [SEP] [CLS] On October 29, the storm passed over Providencia Island, caused significant damage to structures, and injured 30 people. [SEP] [CLS] In Honduras and Nicaragua, over 1,000 structures were damaged by the storm, hundreds of which were destroyed. [SEP] [CLS] Ten people were initially feared dead after their boat went adrift during the storm. [SEP] [CLS] However, a Panamanian vessel rescued the men after drifting in the water for several hours. [SEP] [CLS] Rains in Honduras totaled to 21.82 in (554 mm) and 6.39 in (162 mm) in Nicaragua. [SEP] [CLS] Six people were killed in Nicaragua as a result of the storm and the cost to repair damages exceeded 300 million c√≥rdoba (US$14.5 million).
