[CLS] KLM Flight 607-E, a Lockheed Super Constellation named Hugo de Groot and registered PH-LKM, was an international scheduled flight that crashed 180 kilometres (110 mi) northwest of Shannon Airport, Ireland on 14 August 1958. [SEP] [CLS] All ninety-one passengers and eight crew died in the accident, including six members of the Egyptian fencing team (Osman Abdel Hafeez, Mohamed Ali Riad, Ahmed Sabry, et al.). [SEP] [CLS] The "E" in the flight number stood for the designation of being an extra economy class flight to match the increased seasonal tourist demand.Flight 607-E departed Shannon at 03:05 UTC on the second leg of a transatlantic trip from Amsterdam to New York City with intermediate stops in Shannon and Gander, Newfoundland. [SEP] [CLS] Radio contact with the aircraft was lost at approximately 03:40 UTC; a rescue operation was launched which found light debris on the surface of the ocean approximately 180 kilometres (110 mi) west of Shannon. [SEP] [CLS] The remains of thirty-four of those on board were also recovered.Due to the lack of evidence, Irish and Dutch investigators could not pinpoint a probable cause for the accident. [SEP] [CLS] They examined the possibility of a bomb, electrical failure, or pilot error, but believed that the most likely possibility was a catastrophic mechanical failure. [SEP] [CLS] The investigating Board believed the most likely cause of the accident to be a malfunctioning over-speeding outboard propeller caused by metal particles obstructing oil feed line regulator valves. [SEP] [CLS] The particles may have been formed by a gear that was damaged when the supercharger of the corresponding engine was accelerated (gear ratio shifted). [SEP] [CLS] The malfunctions of the propeller pitch might have provoked a flight disturbance and as a consequence the propeller may have sheared off. [SEP] [CLS]
