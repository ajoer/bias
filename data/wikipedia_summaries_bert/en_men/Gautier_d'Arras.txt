[CLS] Gautier d'Arras (died c. [SEP] [CLS] 1185, Arras) was a Flemish or French trouvère. [SEP] [CLS] He is called Galterus attrebatensis or Walterus de Altrebat in many contemporary Latin documents, the first of which dates from 1160, where he is mentioned as a property owner in Arras (Atrebatum in Latin). [SEP] [CLS] Gautier appears to have been a knight of Arras who between 1160 and 1170 held many important fiefs of St. [SEP] [CLS] Vaast's Abbey and between 1166 and 1185 was an official at the court of Philip of Flanders. [SEP] [CLS] An apparent will is known dating from 1185, in which his wife Agnes and oldest son Roger are named. [SEP] [CLS] He dedicated his romance of Eracle to Theobald V, Count of Blois (d. [SEP] [CLS] 1191); among his other patrons were Marie, countess of Champagne, daughter of Louis VII and Eleanor of Guienne and Baldwin IV, Count of Hainaut. [SEP] [CLS] Eracle, the hero of which becomes emperor of Constantinople as Heraclius, is purely a roman d'aventures and enjoyed great popularity. [SEP] [CLS] His second romance, Ille et Galeron, dedicated to Beatrix, the second wife of Frederick Barbarossa, treats of a similar situation to that outlined in the lay of Eliduc by Marie de France.
