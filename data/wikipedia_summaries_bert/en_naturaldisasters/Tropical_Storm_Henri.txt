The 2015 Atlantic hurricane season was the last of three consecutive below average Atlantic hurricane seasons. [CLS] [SEP] It produced twelve tropical cyclones, eleven named storms, four hurricanes, and two major hurricanes. [CLS] [SEP] The Accumulated Cyclone Energy (ACE) for the season was 68% of the long-term median value. [CLS] [SEP] The hurricane season officially began on June 1, 2015, and ended on November 30, 2015. [CLS] [SEP] These dates historically describe the period each year when most tropical cyclones form in the North Atlantic basin. [CLS] [SEP] However, the first named storm, Ana, developed on May 8, nearly a month before the official start of the season, the first pre-season cyclone since Beryl in 2012 and the earliest since Ana in 2003. [CLS] [SEP] The formation of Ana marked the first in a series of six consecutive seasons with pre-season activity, spanning from 2015-2020. [CLS] [SEP] The season concluded with Kate transitioning into an extratropical cyclone on November 11, almost three weeks before the official end. [CLS] [SEP] Although most of the storms impacted land, overall effects were minimal. [CLS] [SEP] Ana caused minor flooding and wind damage in the Carolinas and left two dead in North Carolina. [CLS] [SEP] Tropical Storm Bill and its remnants caused flooding primarily in the South Central, Midwestern, and Mid-Atlantic regions of the United States, while its precursor also left flooding in Central America and Mexico. [CLS] [SEP] The storm resulted in two deaths in Honduras, two in Guatemala, one in Mexico, and three deaths in the United States. [CLS] [SEP] Additionally, the United States suffered at least $100 million (2015 USD) in damage. [CLS] [SEP] Claudette and Danny left very minimal impact on land. [CLS] [SEP] In late August, Tropical Storm Erika brought heavy rainfall to Dominica, leading to devastating floods. [CLS] [SEP] Erika caused nearly $500 million in damage and 30 fatalities, making it, at the time, the island's deadliest natural disaster since Hurricane David in 1979. [CLS] [SEP] The storm also flooded other nearby islands, but to a much lesser degree, such as Guadeloupe, Puerto Rico, and Hispaniola. [CLS] [SEP] Five additional deaths occurred in Haiti. [CLS] [SEP] Fred prompted a hurricane warning for Cape Verde for the first time ever and was the first storm to pass through the islands as a hurricane since 1892. [CLS] [SEP] Strong winds there left about $2.5 million in damage. [CLS] [SEP] Two deaths were presumed to have occurred after two fishermen never returned to port. [CLS] [SEP] Seven other sailors likely drowned offshore Guinea-Bissau after their fishing boat collapsed. [CLS] [SEP] Tropical storms Grace, Henri, and Ida left negligible impact on land. [CLS] [SEP] Hurricane Joaquin's intensity and slow movement in the vicinity of the Bahamas resulted in severe damage on some islands. [CLS] [SEP] Additionally, the American cargo ship SS El Faro went missing near Crooked Island and eventually capsized during the storm, drowning 33 people. [CLS] [SEP] Rough seas in Haiti also caused damage and one death from a fisherman drowning. [CLS] [SEP] Joaquin was the most intense satellite era tropical cyclone of non-tropical origins. [CLS] [SEP] The remnants of Kate affected the British Isles, particularly Wales in the United Kingdom. [CLS] [SEP] Throughout the season, these storms collectively caused $813.9 million in damage and 89 deaths. [CLS] [SEP] With the exception of Tropical Storm Risk's initial season prediction in December 2014, all major forecasting agencies called for a below or near-average season, due to the strong 2014–16 El Niño event and colder than average sea surface temperatures. [CLS] [SEP] Overall, the forecasts were fairly accurate. [CLS] [SEP]
