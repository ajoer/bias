The Academy of Finland (Finnish: Suomen Akatemia, Swedish: Finlands Akademi) is a governmental funding body for scientific research in Finland. [CLS] [SEP] It is based in Helsinki. [CLS] [SEP] Yearly, the Academy administers over 260 million euros to Finnish research activities. [CLS] [SEP] Over 5000 researchers are working on projects supported by the academy.

[CLS] [SEP] Academy Professor funding has a term of 5 years. [CLS] [SEP] The Academy of Finland should not be confused with the Finnish arts and science school learned societies, The Finnish Academy of Science and Letters (Suomalainen tiedeakatemia) and The Finnish Society of Science and Letters (Finska Vetenskaps-Societeten) which are the two Finnish national honorary academies, for Finnish and Swedish-speaking scientists and scholars, respectively.

[CLS] [SEP] The Finnish title of Academician (akateemikko / akademiker) is an award given by the President of Finland to the most distinguished Finnish scientists, scholars and artists.

[CLS] [SEP] At any time, there may be a maximum of 12 living scientific and scholarly academicians and eight living artistic academicians. [CLS] [SEP] The number of foreign academicians is not limited.
