[CLS] Hurricane Norbert produced a 1-in-1,000 year rainfall event in Arizona in early September 2014. [SEP] [CLS] The fifteenth named storm, tenth hurricane, and seventh major hurricane of the 2014 Pacific hurricane season, Norbert originated from an area of disturbed weather in association with an area of low pressure on September 2. [SEP] [CLS] Tracking generally northwestward, the newly designated tropical storm steadily organized in a moderate shear environment. [SEP] [CLS] Norbert attained hurricane intensity early on September 4 and Category 2 hurricane strength the next afternoon. [SEP] [CLS] Thereafter, the cyclone began a period of rapid deepening, and it subsequently attained its peak intensity with winds of 125 mph (205 km/h) and a minimum pressure of 950 mbar (hPa; 28.26 inHg) early on September 6. [SEP] [CLS] A track over progressively cooler waters and into a more stable environment prompted a weakening trend after peak intensity, and by early on September 8, the system no longer maintained enough convection to be considered a tropical cyclone.
