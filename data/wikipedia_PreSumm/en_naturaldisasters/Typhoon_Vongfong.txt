[CLS] Typhoon Vongfong, known in the Philippines as Typhoon Ambo, was a strong tropical cyclone that impacted the Philippines in May 2020. [SEP] [CLS] Beginning as a tropical depression on May 10 east of Mindanao, Vongfong was the first storm of the 2020 Pacific typhoon season. [SEP] [CLS] It gradually organized as it took a slow northward course, strengthening into a tropical storm on May 12 and curving west thereafter. [SEP] [CLS] The next day, Vongfong entered a period of rapid intensification, becoming a typhoon and attaining 10-minute maximum sustained winds of 150 km/h (100 mph). [SEP] [CLS] The storm made landfall at this intensity near San Policarpo, Eastern Samar, at 04:15 UTC on May 14. [SEP] [CLS] The system tracked across Visayas and Luzon, making a total of seven landfalls. [SEP] [CLS] Persistent land interaction weakened Vongfong, leading to its degeneration into a tropical depression over the Luzon Strait on May 17. [SEP] [CLS] Preparations for the typhoon were complicated due to the ongoing COVID-19 pandemic. [SEP] [CLS] Shelters that opened had to be modified in order to accommodate health guidelines and social distancing.
