[CLS] Hurricane Opal was a large and powerful Category 4 hurricane that caused severe and extensive damage along the northern Gulf Coast of the United States in October 1995. [SEP] [CLS] The ninth hurricane and strongest tropical cyclone of the unusually active 1995 Atlantic hurricane season, Opal developed from the interaction of a tropical wave and a low-pressure area near the Yucatán Peninsula on September 27. [SEP] [CLS] It then crossed the Yucatán Peninsula while still a tropical depression and intensified into a tropical storm on September 30. [SEP] [CLS] After entering the Gulf of Mexico and then becoming a hurricane on October 2, Opal turned northeastward and strengthened significantly. [SEP] [CLS] By October 4, Opal was an intense 150 mph (240 km/h), Category 4 hurricane. [SEP] [CLS] However, the cyclone abruptly weakened to a low-end Category 3 hurricane prior to making landfall in the Florida Panhandle near Pensacola later that day. [SEP] [CLS] The storm quickly weakened inland and became extratropical on October 5. [SEP] [CLS] The remnants of Opal persisted until dissipating over Ontario by the following day. [SEP] [CLS] The precursor and initial stages of Opal brought heavy rainfall and flooding to Guatemala and Mexico. [SEP] [CLS] In the former, flooding and landslides left about 34,000 people homeless and damage to infrastructure and agriculture. [SEP] [CLS] A total of 31 deaths occurred in Guatemala. [SEP] [CLS] In Mexico, a number of rivers overflowed in Campeche and Tabasco, forcing more than 42,000 people to evacuate. [SEP] [CLS] The storm left hundreds of millions of dollars in damage to agriculture in Campeche alone. [SEP] [CLS] Nineteen people were killed in Mexico. [SEP] [CLS] In Florida, high winds and storm surge left extensive damage in the panhandle. [SEP] [CLS] Particularly from Wakulla County westward, a number of structures were swept away or experienced some degree of damage. [SEP] [CLS] In Escambia, Okaloosa, and Santa Rosa counties, nearly 300 homes were destroyed and 1,000 others suffered major damage. [SEP] [CLS] The storm left at least $2.1 billion in damage in Florida alone. [SEP] [CLS] Several other states were impacted by the storm, especially Alabama, where the storm spawned many tornadoes and strong winds downed numerous trees and left about 2.6 million people without electricity. [SEP] [CLS] A total of 27 deaths were attributed to Opal in the United States. [SEP] [CLS] The hurricane overall left about $4.7 billion in damage, much of which took place in the United States. [SEP] [CLS] Due to its effects, the name Opal was retired in the spring of 1996 and replaced with Olga for the 2001 season. [SEP] [CLS]
