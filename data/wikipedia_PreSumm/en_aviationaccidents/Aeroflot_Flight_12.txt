[CLS] Aeroflot Flight 593 was a regular passenger flight from Sheremetyevo International Airport, Moscow, to Kai Tak Airport in Hong Kong. [SEP] [CLS] On 23 March 1994, the aircraft operating the route, an Airbus A310-304 flown by Aeroflot â€“ Russian International Airlines, crashed into a mountain range in Kemerovo Oblast, Russia, killing all 63 passengers and 12 crew members on board. [SEP] [CLS] No evidence of a technical malfunction was found. [SEP] [CLS] Cockpit voice and flight data recorders revealed the presence of the relief pilot's 12-year-old daughter and 16-year-old son on the flight deck. [SEP] [CLS] While seated at the controls, the pilot's son had unknowingly disengaged the A310's autopilot control of the aircraft's ailerons. [SEP] [CLS] The autopilot then disengaged completely causing the aircraft to roll into a steep bank and a near-vertical dive. [SEP] [CLS] Despite managing to level the aircraft, the first officer over-corrected when pulling up, causing the plane to stall and enter into a spin; the pilots managed to level the aircraft off once more, but by then the plane had lost too much altitude to recover and crashed into the Kuznetsk Alatau mountain range.
