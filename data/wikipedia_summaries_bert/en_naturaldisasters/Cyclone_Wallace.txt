[CLS] The 2018–19 Australian region cyclone season was an average season that saw the formation of 11 tropical cyclones, six of which intensified further to become severe tropical cyclones. [SEP] [CLS] The season officially began on 1 November 2018 and concluded on 30 April 2019; however, as evidenced by Tropical Low Liua in September 2018 and Tropical Cyclones Lili and Ann in May 2019, tropical cyclones can form at any time of the year. [SEP] [CLS] As such, any system existing between 1 July 2018 and 30 June 2019 would count towards the season total. [SEP] [CLS] During the season, tropical cyclones were officially monitored by the Bureau of Meteorology (BOM), the Indonesian Agency for Meteorology, Climatology and Geophysics (BMKG) in Jakarta, Indonesia, and the National Weather Service of Papua New Guinea in Port Moresby. [SEP] [CLS] The United States' Joint Typhoon Warning Center (JTWC) in Hawaii, and other national meteorological services such as MetService in New Zealand, Météo-France at La Réunion, and the Fiji Meteorological Service (FMS), also monitored parts of the basin during the season in an unofficial capacity. [SEP] [CLS] This was the first Australian tropical cyclone season since 2014–15 to feature at least six severe tropical cyclones. [SEP] [CLS] It was also the third season in a row to begin prior to the official commencement date of 1 November, in this instance with the development of Tropical Low Liua on 26 September 2018. [SEP] [CLS] The most active month was December 2018, with a total of seven tropical lows existing in the region at some time during the month. [SEP] [CLS] The three strongest storms of the season—Veronica, Trevor and Savannah—all developed in March 2019, and together affected all three of the Bureau of Meteorology's Australian sub-regions as severe tropical cyclones. [SEP] [CLS] Overall, a total of five tropical cyclones existed within each of the three sub-regions throughout the season, representing an above-average season for both the Eastern Region and the Northern Region, but a below-average season for the Western Region. [SEP] [CLS] The season concluded much later than usual, and well after the official ending date of 30 April. [SEP] [CLS] Two tropical cyclones developed during May—Lili in the eastern Indonesian archipelago and Ann in the Coral Sea—both of which made landfall as tropical lows after weakening from tropical cyclone intensity. [SEP] [CLS] At its peak, Ann was a Category 2 tropical cyclone, and was the strongest storm to form in the Australian region during May since Severe Tropical Cyclone Rhonda in 1997. [SEP] [CLS] In total, eight systems were named by the BOM during the season, with two named by the BMKG and one by the FMS. [SEP] [CLS]
