United Airlines Flight 736 was a daily transcontinental passenger flight in the United States operated by United Airlines. [CLS] [SEP] On April 21, 1958, the Douglas DC-7 serving the flight crashed in southern Nevada following a mid-air collision. [CLS] [SEP] The aircraft assigned to Flight 736, an airliner with 47 aboard (42 passengers, 5 crew), was flying at cruise altitude above Clark County, en route to a stopover at Denver, Colorado, when it was struck by a United States Air Force fighter jet crewed by two pilots. [CLS] [SEP] The collision occurred at 8:30 a.m. [CLS] [SEP] in clear weather within a major commercial airway; both aircraft fell out of control from 21,000 feet (6,400 m) and crashed into unpopulated desert terrain southwest of Las Vegas. [CLS] [SEP] There were no survivors from either aircraft, and with 49 fatalities it remains the deadliest crash in the history of the Las Vegas Valley. [CLS] [SEP] Among the victims were a group of military personnel and civilian contractors involved with sensitive Department of Defense weapons systems. [CLS] [SEP] The loss of the group triggered new rules prohibiting similar groups engaged in critical projects from flying aboard the same aircraft. [CLS] [SEP] The official investigation stated that cockpit visibility limitations played a role in the accident, but also faulted military and civilian aviation authorities for not taking measures to reduce well known collision risks that had existed for over a year within the confines of airways, despite numerous complaints from airline crews. [CLS] [SEP] The loss of Flight 736, one of a series of 1950s mid-air collisions in American skies, helped usher-in widespread improvements in air traffic control within the United States.
