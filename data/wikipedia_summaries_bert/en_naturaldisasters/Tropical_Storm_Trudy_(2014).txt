[CLS] Tropical Storm Trudy was a short-lived tropical cyclone in October 2014 that caused significant flooding in southern Mexico. [SEP] [CLS] The storm originated from an area of low pressure associated with a monsoon trough near Central America in early October. [SEP] [CLS] A slow-moving system, the low eventually consolidated into a tropical depression on October 17 near the Mexican coastline. [SEP] [CLS] Favorable environmental conditions aided rapid development of Trudy. [SEP] [CLS] Within 15 hours of its designation, an eye formed over the storm's center. [SEP] [CLS] Trudy ultimately achieved its peak as a strong tropical storm with 65 mph (100 km/h) winds as it made landfall just southeast of Marquelia, Mexico. [SEP] [CLS] The region's mountainous terrain quickly weakened Trudy and the cyclone dissipated early on October 19. [SEP] [CLS] Though the cyclone dissipated, its remnant energy later contributed to the formation of Tropical Storm Hanna in the Atlantic. [SEP] [CLS] Prior to Trudy's landfall, the Government of Mexico issued multiple watches and warnings for the threatened region. [SEP] [CLS] Forecasters highlighted the threat of heavy rains and mudslides. [SEP] [CLS] Guerrero experienced the greatest effects from Trudy, with landslides and flooding claiming eight lives in the state. [SEP] [CLS] Over 4,000 people were evacuated in the region. [SEP] [CLS] A ninth fatality took place in Campeche. [SEP] [CLS]
