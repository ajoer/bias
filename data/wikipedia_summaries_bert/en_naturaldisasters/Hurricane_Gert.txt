[CLS] Hurricane Gert was a large tropical cyclone that caused extensive flooding and mudslides throughout Central America and Mexico in September 1993. [SEP] [CLS] The seventh named storm and third hurricane of the annual hurricane season, Gert originated as a tropical depression from a tropical wave over the southwestern Caribbean Sea on September 14. [SEP] [CLS] The next day, the cyclone briefly attained tropical storm strength before moving ashore in Nicaragua and proceeding through Honduras. [SEP] [CLS] It reorganized into a tropical storm over the Gulf of Honduras on September 17, but weakened back to a depression upon crossing the Yucatán Peninsula. [SEP] [CLS] Once over the warm waters of the Bay of Campeche, Gert quickly strengthened into a Category 2 hurricane by September 20. [SEP] [CLS] The hurricane made a final landfall on the Gulf Coast of Mexico near Tuxpan, Veracruz, with peak winds of 100 mph (155 km/h). [SEP] [CLS] The rugged terrain disrupted the cyclone's structure; Gert entered the Pacific Ocean as a depression near the state of Nayarit on September 21, where it briefly redeveloped a few strong thunderstorms before dissipating at sea five days later. [SEP] [CLS] Gert's broad wind circulation produced widespread and heavy rainfall across Central America through September 15–17. [SEP] [CLS] Combined with saturated soil following Tropical Storm Bret's passage a month earlier, the rain triggered widespread floods and mudslides that isolated thousands of people across numerous communities. [SEP] [CLS] In Costa Rica, blustery weather destroyed a national park and led to significant losses in the agricultural and tourism sectors. [SEP] [CLS] Much of the Mosquito Coast of Nicaragua and Honduras endured overflowing rivers, engulfing cities, villages, and crops with mud and water. [SEP] [CLS] Gert's winds were at their strongest upon landfall in Mexico, yet the worst effects in the country were also due to freshwater flooding after an extreme rainfall event in the Huasteca region resulted in water accumulations as high as 31.41 inches (798 mm). [SEP] [CLS] An increasing number of major rivers burst their banks over a period of several days, fully submerging extensive areas of land around the Pánuco basin. [SEP] [CLS] Tens of thousands of residents were forced to evacuate as raging floodwaters demolished scores of structures in what was described as the region's worst disaster in 40 years. [SEP] [CLS] In Gert's wake, the road networks across the affected countries remained severely disrupted for extended periods of time, hampering rescue missions and relief efforts in badly flooded regions. [SEP] [CLS] National governments and emergency workers opened shelters and distributed food for the thousands that had lost their homes and sources of income in the storm. [SEP] [CLS] Throughout Central America and Mexico, Gert claimed the lives of 116 people and left 16 others missing. [SEP] [CLS] The disaster left swaths of private property, infrastructure, and farmland in complete ruins, amounting to damage costs of more than $170 million (1993 USD). [SEP] [CLS]
