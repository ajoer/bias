[CLS] Severe Tropical Cyclone Kelvin was a strong tropical cyclone that impacted Western Australia in February 2018. [SEP] [CLS] The system was first identified as a weak tropical low on the morning of 11 February over the Northern Territory's Tiwi Islands by the Bureau of Meteorology. [SEP] [CLS] The low moved southwestwards over land and emerged over the Indian Ocean near Broome on 16 February. [SEP] [CLS] The storm intensified into a Category 1 tropical cyclone on the following day, becoming the sixth named cyclone of the 2017â€“18 season. [SEP] [CLS] Kelvin subsequently moved slowly eastwards and proceeded to rapidly intensify in the hours prior to landfall. [SEP] [CLS] The system crossed the coast along Eighty Mile Beach as a Category 3 severe tropical cyclone on the Australian scale, and a high-end Category 1 hurricane-equivalent cyclone on the Saffir-Simpson scale. [SEP] [CLS] Kelvin weakened at a very slow rate over the next few days, and was downgraded to a tropical low on 19 February. [SEP] [CLS] Kelvin brought widespread heavy rainfall to the Kimberley region which had already been saturated by other tropical cyclone systems. [SEP] [CLS] As a result, significant flooding occurred in parts of the Kimberley, including in the towns of Broome and Bidyadanga. [SEP] [CLS] Property damage was sustained at Broome and Anna Plains Station, where the cyclone made landfall, as well as infrastructural damage to the Great Northern Highway as a result of the heavy rainfall and flooding.
