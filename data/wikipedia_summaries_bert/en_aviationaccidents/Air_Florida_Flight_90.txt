[CLS] [SEP] and Arlington County, Virginia, it hit seven occupied vehicles and destroyed 97 feet (30 m) of guard rail before plunging through the ice into the Potomac River. [CLS] [SEP] The aircraft was carrying 74 passengers and five crew members. [CLS] [SEP] Only four passengers and one crew member (a flight attendant) were rescued from the crash and survived. [CLS] [SEP] Another passenger, Arland D. [CLS] [SEP] Williams, Jr., assisted in the rescue of the survivors but drowned before he could be rescued.

[CLS] [SEP] President Ronald Reagan commended these acts during his State of the Union speech a few days later. [CLS] [SEP] The National Transportation Safety Board (NTSB) determined that the cause of the accident was pilot error. [CLS] [SEP] The pilots failed to switch on the engines' internal ice protection systems, used reverse thrust in a snowstorm prior to takeoff, tried to use the jet exhaust of a plane in front of them to melt their ice, and failed to abort the takeoff even after detecting a power problem while taxiing and seeing ice and snow buildup on the wings.
