[CLS] Emperor Jing of Han (188 BC – 9 March 141 BC), personal name Liu Qi (劉啟), was the sixth emperor of the Chinese Han dynasty from 157 to 141 BC. [SEP] [CLS] His reign saw the limiting of the power of the feudal kings/princes which resulted in the Rebellion of the Seven States in 154 BC. [SEP] [CLS] Emperor Jing managed to crush the revolt and princes were thereafter denied rights to appoint ministers for their fiefs. [SEP] [CLS] This move helped to consolidate central power which paved the way for the long reign of his son Emperor Wu of Han. [SEP] [CLS] Emperor Jing had a complicated personality. [SEP] [CLS] He continued his father Emperor Wen's policy of general non-interference with the people, reduced tax and other burdens, and promoted government thrift. [SEP] [CLS] He continued and magnified his father's policy of reduction in criminal sentences. [SEP] [CLS] His light governance of the people was due to the Taoist influences of his mother, Empress Dou. [SEP] [CLS] He was also criticized for general ungratefulness to others, including harsh treatments of Zhou Yafu, the general whose abilities allowed his victory in the Rebellion of the Seven States, and his wife Empress Bo. [SEP] [CLS] He was the last emperor of Han who was the common ancestor of all subsequent emperors; all subsequent emperors of the Western Han were descendants of Emperor Wu, while all emperors of the Eastern Han were descendants of his sixth son Liu Fa, Prince Ding of Changsha.
