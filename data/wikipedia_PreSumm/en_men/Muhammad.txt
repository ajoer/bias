[CLS] Muhammad (Arabic: مُحَمَّد‎, pronounced [muħammad]; c. [SEP] [CLS] 570 CE – 8 June 632 CE) was an Arab religious, social, and political leader and the founder of Islam. [SEP] [CLS] According to Islamic doctrine, he was a prophet, sent to preach and confirm the monotheistic teachings of Adam, Abraham, Moses, Jesus, and other prophets. [SEP] [CLS] He is viewed as the final prophet of God in all the main branches of Islam, though some modern denominations diverge from this belief. [SEP] [CLS] Muhammad united Arabia into a single Muslim polity, with the Quran as well as his teachings and practices forming the basis of Islamic religious belief. [SEP] [CLS] Born approximately 570 CE (Year of the Elephant) in the Arabian city of Mecca, Muhammad was orphaned at the age of six. [SEP] [CLS] He was raised under the care of his paternal grandfather Abd al-Muttalib, and upon his death, by his uncle Abu Talib. [SEP] [CLS] In later years, he would periodically seclude himself in a mountain cave named Hira for several nights of prayer. [SEP] [CLS] When he was 40, Muhammad reported being visited by Gabriel in the cave and receiving his first revelation from God. [SEP] [CLS] In 613, Muhammad started preaching these revelations publicly, proclaiming that "God is One", that complete "submission" (islām) to God is the right way of life (dīn), and that he was a prophet and messenger of God, similar to the other prophets in Islam.The followers of Muhammad were initially few in number, and experienced hostility from Meccan polytheists. [SEP] [CLS] He sent some of his followers to Abyssinia in 615 to shield them from prosecution, before he and his followers migrated from Mecca to Medina (then known as Yathrib) in 622. [SEP] [CLS] This event, the Hijra, marks the beginning of the Islamic calendar, also known as the Hijri Calendar. [SEP] [CLS] In Medina, Muhammad united the tribes under the Constitution of Medina. [SEP] [CLS] In December 629, after eight years of intermittent fighting with Meccan tribes, Muhammad gathered an army of 10,000 Muslim converts and marched on the city of Mecca. [SEP] [CLS] The conquest went largely uncontested and Muhammad seized the city with little bloodshed. [SEP] [CLS] In 632, a few months after returning from the Farewell Pilgrimage, he fell ill and died. [SEP] [CLS] By the time of his death, most of the Arabian Peninsula had converted to Islam.The revelations (each known as Ayah — literally, "Sign [of God]") that Muhammad reported receiving until his death form the verses of the Quran, regarded by Muslims as the verbatim "Word of God" on which the religion is based. [SEP] [CLS] Besides the Quran, Muhammad's teachings and practices (sunnah), found in the Hadith and sira (biography) literature, are also upheld and used as sources of Islamic law (see Sharia).
