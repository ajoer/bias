[CLS] Blondel de Nesle – either Jean I of Nesle (c. [SEP] [CLS] 1155 – 1202) or his son Jean II of Nesle (died 1241) – was a French trouvère. [SEP] [CLS] The name 'Blondel de Nesle' is attached to twenty-four or twenty-five courtly songs. [SEP] [CLS] He was identified in 1942, by Holger Dyggve, as Jean II of Nesle (near Amiens), who was nicknamed 'Blondel' for his long blond hair. [SEP] [CLS] He married at the time of his father's death in 1202, and that same year, went on the Fourth Crusade; he later fought in the Albigensian Crusade. [SEP] [CLS] However, in 1994, Yvan Lepage suggested that the poet may have been Jean I, father of Jean II, who was Lord of Nesle from 1180 to 1202; this Jean took part in the Third Crusade, which may explain the subsequent legend linking him with King Richard I of England. [SEP] [CLS] If the works are correctly identified and dated, he was a significant influence on his European contemporaries, who made much use of his melodies. [SEP] [CLS] (The melody of "L'amours dont sui espris" is used in Carmina Burana, for the song "Procurans Odium"). [SEP] [CLS] His works are fairly conventional, and several have been recorded in modern times. [SEP] [CLS]
