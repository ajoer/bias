[CLS] Hurricane Rafael produced minor damage in the northeastern Caribbean Sea in mid-October 2012. [SEP] [CLS] The seventeenth named storm and ninth hurricane of the annual hurricane season, Rafael originated from a tropical wave roughly 230 mi (370 km) south-southeast of Saint Croix on October 12; because the system already contained tropical storm-force winds, it skipped tropical depression status. [SEP] [CLS] Though initially disorganized due to moderate wind shear, a subsequent decrease allowed for shower and thunderstorm activity to develop in earnest by October 14. [SEP] [CLS] While moving north-northwestward the following morning, Rafael intensified into a Category 1 hurricane. [SEP] [CLS] A cold front off the East Coast of the United States caused the system to turn northward and eventually northeastward by October 16, at which time Rafael attained its peak intensity with maximum sustained winds of 90 mph (150 km/h). [SEP] [CLS] As the cyclone entered a more stable atmosphere and tracked across increasingly cooler sea surface temperatures, it began extratropical transition, a process the system completed by the following afternoon. [SEP] [CLS] As a disorganized tropical cyclone in the northeastern Caribbean, Rafael produced major flooding across the region. [SEP] [CLS] As much as a foot of rain fell across portions of the Lesser Antilles, causing mudslides, landslides, and river flooding. [SEP] [CLS] In addition, the heavy rains led to significant crop loss. [SEP] [CLS] Sustained winds near hurricane force were recorded on Saint Martin, while tropical storm-force gusts occurred widespread. [SEP] [CLS] Lightning activity as a result of heavy thunderstorms caused many fires and power outages. [SEP] [CLS] One fatality occurred when a woman in Guadeloupe unsuccessfully attempted to drive her car across a flooded roadway. [SEP] [CLS] As Rafael passed just to the east of Bermuda as a hurricane, light rainfall was recorded. [SEP] [CLS] Gusts over 50 mph (85 km/h) left hundreds of houses without electricity. [SEP] [CLS] Large swells from the system caused significant damage to the coastline of Nova Scotia, while many roads were washed away or obscured with debris, but overall, damage was minimal.
