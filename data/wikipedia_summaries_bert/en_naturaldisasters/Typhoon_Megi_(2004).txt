The 2004 Pacific typhoon season was a very active season; it ran year-round in 2004, but most tropical cyclones tend to form in the northwestern Pacific Ocean between May and November. [CLS] [SEP] These dates conventionally delimit the period of each year when most tropical cyclones form in the northwestern Pacific Ocean. [CLS] [SEP] The scope of this article is limited to the Pacific Ocean, north of the equator and west of the International Date Line. [CLS] [SEP] Storms that form east of the date line and north of the equator are called hurricanes; see 2004 Pacific hurricane season. [CLS] [SEP] All tropical storms that develop in the western Pacific Ocean are assigned a name by the Japan Meteorological Agency (JMA). [CLS] [SEP] Tropical depressions in this basin have a "W" suffix added to their number by the Joint Typhoon Warning Center (JTWC). [CLS] [SEP] Tropical depressions that enter or form in the Philippine area of responsibility are assigned a name by the Philippine Atmospheric, Geophysical and Astronomical Services Administration (PAGASA). [CLS] [SEP] This can often result in the same storm having two names. [CLS] [SEP] The 2004 season was a very active season. [CLS] [SEP] Of the 29 storms named in this year, 19 reached typhoon intensity. [CLS] [SEP] The accumulated cyclone energy (ACE) index of this season amounted to 60% above the normal level for Pacific typhoon seasons, at 480. [CLS] [SEP] This makes 2004 season the third most active season in recorded history, only after 1997 and 1992. [CLS] [SEP]
