[CLS] The Lovettsville air disaster occurred on August 31, 1940 near Lovettsville, Virginia. [SEP] [CLS] Pennsylvania Central Airlines Trip 19, a new Douglas DC-3A, was flying from Washington, D.C. [SEP] [CLS] to Detroit with a stopover in Pittsburgh. [SEP] [CLS] While the aircraft was flying at 6,000 feet (1,800 m) and approaching the West Virginia border, Trip 19 encountered an intense thunderstorm. [SEP] [CLS] Numerous witnesses reported seeing a large flash of lightning shortly before it nosed over and plunged to earth in an alfalfa field. [SEP] [CLS] With limited accident investigation tools at the time, it was at first believed that the most likely cause was the plane flying into windshear, but the Civil Aeronautics Board report concluded that the probable cause was a lightning strike. [SEP] [CLS] U.S. [SEP] [CLS] Senator Ernest Lundeen from Minnesota was one of the 25 people (21 passengers and 4 crew members) killed.The crash occurred during a severe rainstorm, and recovery efforts were hindered by impassable flooded roads and poor communications: the crash cut the only telephone lines in the area. [SEP] [CLS] Wreckage was scattered over a broad area and it is believed that all aircraft occupants died instantly on impact. [SEP] [CLS] At the time, the crash was the deadliest disaster in the history of U.S. [SEP] [CLS] commercial aviation."Trip 19", as it was designated, was under the command of Captain Lowell V. [SEP] [CLS] Scroggins with First Officer J. [SEP] [CLS] Paul Moore. [SEP] [CLS] The pilot and copilot had over eleven thousand and six thousand hours experience respectively, although only a few hundred of those hours were on DC-3s. [SEP] [CLS] In the jump seat rode a new administrative employee of the airline, hired on August 26.The DC-3A was newly delivered from Douglas Aircraft on May 25, 1940, equipped with twin Curtiss-Wright R-1820 Cyclone 9 engines (also designated as G-102-A).The CAB investigation of the accident was the first major investigation to be conducted under the Bureau of Air Commerce act of 1938.
