Hurricane Gert was a strong tropical cyclone that brought heavy surf and rip currents to the East Coast of the United States in August 2017. [CLS] [SEP] Gert originated from a tropical wave that moved off the coast of Africa on August 3 yet failed to organize significantly until August 12, when the system coalesced into a tropical depression east of the Bahamas. [CLS] [SEP] A few hours later, the depression became the seventh tropical storm of the annual hurricane season and was named Gert. [CLS] [SEP] For the next day, though, further intensification was hindered by the proximity of dry air. [CLS] [SEP] Once Gert was able to overcome that on August 14, however, Gert resumed strengthening while moving northwards, paralleling the United States coastline. [CLS] [SEP] Gert reached its peak intensity on August 16 at Category 2 status on the Saffirâ€“Simpson scale as it accelerated northeastwards. [CLS] [SEP] Thereafter, increasing vertical wind shear and decreasing sea surface temperatures caused Gert to rapidly weaken and transition into an extratropical cyclone on August 17, well east of Atlantic Canada. [CLS] [SEP] The remnants of Gert dissipated late on August 18, after they merged with another extratropical cyclone over the open Atlantic. [CLS] [SEP] During its lifetime, Gert brought heavy swells, rough surf, and rip currents to the East Coast of the United States and Atlantic Canada. [CLS] [SEP] Two fatalities occurred when two swimmers drowned amid heavy surf. [CLS] [SEP] The extratropical system that merged with the remnants of Gert went on to bring strong winds and rain to Ireland and parts of the United Kingdom. [CLS] [SEP]
