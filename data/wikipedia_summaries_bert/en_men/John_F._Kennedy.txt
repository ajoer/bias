John Fitzgerald Kennedy (May 29, 1917 â€“ November 22, 1963), often referred to by his initials JFK and Jack, was an American politician who served as the 35th president of the United States from January 1961 until his assassination in November 1963. [CLS] [SEP] Kennedy served at the height of the Cold War, and the majority of his work as president concerned relations with the Soviet Union and Cuba. [CLS] [SEP] A Democrat, Kennedy represented Massachusetts in the U.S. [CLS] [SEP] House of Representatives and Senate prior to becoming president. [CLS] [SEP] Kennedy was born into a wealthy, political family in Brookline, Massachusetts. [CLS] [SEP] He graduated from Harvard University in 1940, before joining the U.S. [CLS] [SEP] Naval Reserve the following year. [CLS] [SEP] During World War II, he commanded a series of PT boats in the Pacific theater and earned the Navy and Marine Corps Medal for his service. [CLS] [SEP] After a brief stint in journalism, Kennedy represented a working-class Boston district in the U.S. [CLS] [SEP] House of Representatives from 1947 to 1953. [CLS] [SEP] He was subsequently elected to the U.S. [CLS] [SEP] Senate and served as the junior Senator from Massachusetts from 1953 to 1960. [CLS] [SEP] While in the Senate, Kennedy published his book, Profiles in Courage, which won a Pulitzer Prize. [CLS] [SEP] In the 1960 presidential election, he narrowly defeated Republican opponent Richard Nixon, who was the incumbent vice president. [CLS] [SEP] Kennedy's administration included high tensions with communist states in the Cold War. [CLS] [SEP] As a result, he increased the number of American military advisers in South Vietnam. [CLS] [SEP] In April 1961, he authorized an attempt to overthrow the Cuban government of Fidel Castro in the Bay of Pigs Invasion. [CLS] [SEP] Kennedy authorized the Cuban Project in November 1961. [CLS] [SEP] He rejected Operation Northwoods (plans for false flag attacks to gain approval for a war against Cuba) in March 1962. [CLS] [SEP] However, his administration continued to plan for an invasion of Cuba in the summer of 1962. [CLS] [SEP] The following October, U.S. [CLS] [SEP] spy planes discovered Soviet missile bases had been deployed in Cuba; the resulting period of tensions, termed the Cuban Missile Crisis, nearly resulted in the breakout of a global thermonuclear conflict. [CLS] [SEP] The Strategic Hamlet Program began in Vietnam during his presidency. [CLS] [SEP] Domestically, Kennedy presided over the establishment of the Peace Corps and the continuation of the Apollo space program. [CLS] [SEP] He also supported the civil rights movement, but was only somewhat successful in passing his New Frontier domestic policies. [CLS] [SEP] On November 22, 1963, he was assassinated in Dallas, Texas. [CLS] [SEP] Vice President Lyndon B. [CLS] [SEP] Johnson assumed the presidency upon Kennedy's death. [CLS] [SEP] Marxist and former U.S. [CLS] [SEP] Marine Lee Harvey Oswald was arrested for the state crime, but he was shot and killed by Jack Ruby two days later. [CLS] [SEP] The FBI and the Warren Commission both concluded Oswald had acted alone in the assassination, but various groups contested the Warren Report and believed that Kennedy was the victim of a conspiracy. [CLS] [SEP] After Kennedy's death, Congress enacted many of his proposals, including the Civil Rights Act and the Revenue Act of 1964. [CLS] [SEP] Kennedy ranks highly in polls of U.S. [CLS] [SEP] presidents with historians and the general public. [CLS] [SEP] His personal life has also been the focus of considerable sustained interest following public revelations in the 1970s of his chronic health ailments and extramarital affairs.
