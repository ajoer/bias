The Minoan eruption was a major catastrophic volcanic eruption that devastated the Aegean island of Thera (now called Santorini) in around 1600 BCE. [CLS] [SEP] It destroyed the Minoan settlement at Akrotiri, as well as communities and agricultural areas on nearby islands and the coast of Crete with related earthquakes and tsunamis. [CLS] [SEP] With a VEI magnitude of 6 or 7 and a dense-rock equivalent (DRE) of 60 km3 (14 cu mi), the eruption was one of the largest volcanic events on Earth in human history.Although there are no clear ancient records of the eruption, the Minoan eruption may have been alluded to in the Egyptian Tempest Stele, as well as the Chinese Bamboo Annals. [CLS] [SEP] Since its tephra serves as a marker horizon in nearly all archaeological sites in the Eastern Mediterranean, the precise date of the Minoan eruption is of high importance and still fiercely debated among archaeologists and natural scientists.
