The 1916 Texas hurricane was an intense and quick-moving tropical cyclone that caused widespread damage in Jamaica and South Texas in August 1916. [CLS] [SEP] A Category 4 hurricane upon landfall in Texas, it was the strongest tropical cyclone to strike the United States in three decades. [CLS] [SEP] Throughout its eight-day trek across the Caribbean Sea and Gulf of Mexico, the hurricane caused 37 fatalities and inflicted $11.8 million in damage.Weather observations were limited for most of the storm's history, so much of its evolution has been inferred from scant data analyzed by the Atlantic hurricane reanalysis project in 2008. [CLS] [SEP] The precursor disturbance organized into a small tropical storm by August 12, shortly before crossing the Lesser Antilles into the Caribbean Sea. [CLS] [SEP] The storm skirted the southern coast of Jamaica as a hurricane on August 15, killing 17 people. [CLS] [SEP] No banana plantation was left unscathed by the hours-long onslaught of strong winds. [CLS] [SEP] Coconut and cocoa trees also sustained severe losses. [CLS] [SEP] The southern parishes saw the severest effects, incurring extensive damage to crops and buildings; damage in Jamaica amounted to $10 million (equivalent to $235 million in 2019). [CLS] [SEP] The storm then traversed the Yucatán Channel into the Gulf of Mexico and intensified further into the equivalent of a major hurricane on the modern-day Saffir–Simpson scale.On the evening of August 16, the hurricane struck South Texas near Baffin Bay with winds of 130 mph (215 km/h). [CLS] [SEP] Buildings were razed at many coastal cities, the worst impacts being felt in Corpus Christi and surrounding communities. [CLS] [SEP] Beachfront structures were destroyed by a 9.2 ft (2.8 m) storm surge. [CLS] [SEP] Strong gusts and heavy rainfall spread farther inland across mainly rural sectors of South Texas, damaging towns and their outlying agricultural districts alike. [CLS] [SEP] Railroads and other public utilities were disrupted across the region, with widespread power outages. [CLS] [SEP] Eight locations set 24-hour rainfall records; among them was Harlingen, which recorded the storm's rainfall maximum with 6 in (150 mm) of precipitation. [CLS] [SEP] The deluge wrought havoc on military camps along the Mexico–United States border, forcing 30,000 garrisoned militiamen to evacuate. [CLS] [SEP] Aggregate property damage across Texas reached $1.8 million (equivalent to $42 million in 2019), and 20 people were killed. [CLS] [SEP] The hurricane quickly weakened over southwestern Texas and dissipated near New Mexico by August 20. [CLS] [SEP]
