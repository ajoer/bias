[CLS] Hurricane Fausto was a long-lived tropical cyclone that formed during the 2002 Pacific hurricane season. [SEP] [CLS] The eighth tropical cyclone and fifth named storm of the season, Fausto developed on August 21 from a tropical wave that had crossed the Atlantic, and entered the Pacific on August 17. [SEP] [CLS] Becoming a tropical depression, the system intensified, and quickly became Tropical Storm Fausto early on August 22. [SEP] [CLS] Fausto rapidly intensified, and was already a hurricane on that same day as becoming a tropical storm. [SEP] [CLS] Rapid intensification continued, and the tropical cyclone ultimately peaked as a strong Category 4 hurricane on the Saffirâ€“Simpson hurricane scale. [SEP] [CLS] At that time, the winds 145 mph (230 km/h). [SEP] [CLS] Fausto began to gradually weaken after attaining peak intensity on August 24, and was eventually downgraded to a tropical storm two days later. [SEP] [CLS] Weakening continued, and Fausto degenerated into a remnant low on August 28 while well northeast of Hawaii. [SEP] [CLS] Passing north of the Hawaiian Islands, the remnants of the hurricane later began to revive, and had re-developed into a tropical depression on August 30. [SEP] [CLS] Additional re-intensification was not significant, although Fausto managed to become a tropical storm again on September 1. [SEP] [CLS] Remaining a minimal tropical storm, no further intensification occurred, and by September 3, Fausto was absorbed by a frontal system. [SEP] [CLS]
