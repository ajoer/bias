Ferdinand "Nand" Peeters (Mechelen, October 13, 1918 – Turnhout, December 27, 1998) was a Belgian obstetrician and gynecologist, whose research led directly to the development of Anovlar, the first combined oral contraceptive pill introduced outside the United States, in 1961, the first whose side-effects were acceptable, and the first that was used world-wide (Albach 1997:939). [CLS] [SEP] It remained in production, in its original formula, from its introduction until 1986 — although, beginning in 1964, Schering AG (the company that produced it) also marketed variants with lower doses of hormones, some of which continued to be named Anovlar. [CLS] [SEP] Nand Peeters's research also contributed substantially to the treatment of Rh-disease. [CLS] [SEP]
