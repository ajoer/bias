[CLS] Nero ( NEER-oh; Nero Claudius Caesar Augustus Germanicus; 15 December 37 – 9 June 68 AD) was Roman emperor from 54 to 68, the last ruler of the Julio-Claudian dynasty. [SEP] [CLS] Born Lucius Domitius Ahenobarbus, he was the son of Gnaeus Domitius Ahenobarbus and Agrippina the Younger, the sister of Emperor Caligula. [SEP] [CLS] Nero's father died in 40, and his uncle was murdered in 41. [SEP] [CLS] Nero's great-uncle Claudius then ascended the throne. [SEP] [CLS] Agrippina married Claudius, who adopted Nero as his heir. [SEP] [CLS] Nero succeeded Claudius upon the latter's death in 54. [SEP] [CLS] During the early years of his reign, Nero was content to be guided by his mother Agrippina, his tutor Seneca, and his Praetorian prefect Sextus Afranius Burrus. [SEP] [CLS] Agrippina dominated Nero's early life and decisions until he cast her off and had her killed five years into his reign. [SEP] [CLS] As time passed, he began to play a more active and independent role in government and foreign policy. [SEP] [CLS] During his reign, the redoubtable general Corbulo conducted a successful war and negotiated peace with the Parthian Empire. [SEP] [CLS] His general Suetonius Paulinus crushed a major revolt in Britain, led by the Iceni Queen Boudica. [SEP] [CLS] The Bosporan Kingdom was briefly annexed to the empire, and the First Jewish–Roman War began. [SEP] [CLS] Nero focused much of his attention on diplomacy and trade, as well as the cultural life of the empire, ordering theatres built and promoting athletic games. [SEP] [CLS] He made public appearances as an actor, poet, musician, and charioteer. [SEP] [CLS] In the eyes of traditionalists, this undermined the dignity and authority of his person, status, and office. [SEP] [CLS] His extravagant, empire-wide program of public and private works was funded by a rise in taxes that was much resented by the upper classes. [SEP] [CLS] In contrast, his populist style of rule remained well-admired among the lower classes of Rome and the provinces until his death and beyond. [SEP] [CLS] Various plots against his life were revealed, the leaders of which—most of them Nero's own courtiers—who would be executed (at least until his final demise). [SEP] [CLS] In AD 68 Vindex, governor of the Gaulish territory Gallia Lugdunensis, rebelled, with support from Galba, governor of Hispania Tarraconensis. [SEP] [CLS] Vindex's revolt failed in its immediate aim, though Nero fled Rome when its discontented civil and military authorities chose Galba as emperor. [SEP] [CLS] On 9 June in AD 68, he committed suicide, becoming the first Roman Emperor to do so, after learning that he had been tried in absentia and condemned to death as a public enemy. [SEP] [CLS] His death ended the Julio-Claudian dynasty, sparking a brief period of civil wars known as the Year of the Four Emperors. [SEP] [CLS] Nero's rule is usually associated with tyranny and extravagance. [SEP] [CLS] Most Roman sources, including Suetonius and Cassius Dio, offer overwhelmingly negative assessments of his personality and reign; likewise, Tacitus claims that the Roman people thought him compulsive and corrupt. [SEP] [CLS] Suetonius tells that many Romans believed that the Great Fire of Rome was instigated by Nero to clear the way for his planned palatial complex, the Domus Aurea. [SEP] [CLS] According to Tacitus he was said to have seized Christians as scapegoats for the fire and burned them alive, seemingly motivated not by public justice but by personal cruelty. [SEP] [CLS] Some modern historians question the reliability of the ancient sources on Nero's tyrannical acts, however. [SEP] [CLS] A few sources paint Nero in a more favorable light. [SEP] [CLS] There is evidence of his popularity among the Roman commoners, especially in the eastern provinces of the Empire, where a popular legend arose that Nero had not died and would return. [SEP] [CLS] At least three leaders of short-lived, failed rebellions presented themselves as "Nero reborn" to enlist popular support. [SEP] [CLS]
