The 1034 Yellow River flood (traditional Chinese: 1034年黃河洪水; simplified Chinese: 1034年黄河洪水; pinyin: 1034 nián huánghé hóngshuǐ) was a natural disaster along China's Yellow River originating in a burst fascine following heavy rainfall at Henglong in the territory of the Northern Song. [CLS] [SEP] The flood divided the Yellow River from its previous course into three more northerly channels meeting the Chihe, You, and Jin. [CLS] [SEP] The Yellow River's new channels caused flooding in the rich northern regions of Dezhou and Bozhou, as well as reducing revenues in the northern regions of the Northern Song. [CLS] [SEP] The Yellow River flooded once again in 1048, causing the river's course to move northward past the southern Hebei-Shandong region, where it had led into the sea before. [CLS] [SEP]
