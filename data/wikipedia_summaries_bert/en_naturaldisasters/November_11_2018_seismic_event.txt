The 11 November 2018 Mayotte seismic event is a seismic event of unknown origin that occurred about 24 kilometres (15 mi) off the coast of Mayotte, an overseas department and region of France in the Indian Ocean. [CLS] [SEP] It was recorded by seismograms in many countries, including Kenya, Chile, New Zealand, Canada, and Hawaii, almost 18,000 kilometres (11,000 mi) away. [CLS] [SEP] Despite this, no one felt it. [CLS] [SEP] The seismic waves lasted for over 20 minutes. [CLS] [SEP] Most earthquakes have P-waves and S-waves, which are later followed by long-period surface waves. [CLS] [SEP] The Mayotte event lacked P-waves and S-waves, but did cause a long-period surface wave travelling at 14,000 km/h (9,000 mph) around the globe. [CLS] [SEP] Additionally, the signal released by the earthquake was a clean "zigzag," while most earthquake waves have multiple frequencies. [CLS] [SEP]
