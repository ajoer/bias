[CLS] The Tampa Bay hurricane of 1921 (also known as the 1921 Tarpon Springs hurricane) is the most recent major hurricane to strike the Tampa Bay Area. [SEP] [CLS] The eleventh tropical cyclone, sixth tropical storm, and fifth hurricane of the season, the storm developed from a trough in the southwestern Caribbean Sea on October 20. [SEP] [CLS] Initially a tropical storm, the system moved northwestward and intensified into a hurricane on October 22 and a major hurricane by October 23. [SEP] [CLS] Later that day, the cyclone peaked as a Category 4 on the modern day Saffir–Simpson scale with maximum sustained winds of 140 mph (220 km/h). [SEP] [CLS] After entering the Gulf of Mexico, the hurricane gradually curved northeastward and weakened to a Category 3 before making landfall near Tarpon Springs, Florida, late on October 25, becoming the first major hurricane to hit the area since a hurricane in 1848. [SEP] [CLS] The storm quickly weakened to a Category 1 hurricane while crossing Central Florida, before reaching the Atlantic Ocean early on the following day. [SEP] [CLS] Thereafter, system moved east-southeastward and remained fairly steady in intensity before weakening to a tropical storm late on October 29. [SEP] [CLS] The storm was then absorbed by a larger extratropical cyclone early the next day, with the remnants of the hurricane soon becoming indistinguishable. [SEP] [CLS] The storm brought strong winds to the Swan Islands, including hurricane-force winds on the main island. [SEP] [CLS] Heavy rains fell in Cuba, particularly in Pinar del Río Province, but only minor damage occurred. [SEP] [CLS] In Florida, storm surge and abnormally high tides caused damage along much of the state's west coast from Pasco County southward. [SEP] [CLS] Several neighborhoods and sections of Tampa were inundated, especially in Ballast Point, DeSoto Park, Edgewater Park, Hyde Park, Palmetto Beach, and other areas in the vicinity of Bayshore Boulevard. [SEP] [CLS] Strong winds also damaged hundreds of trees, signs, buildings, and homes. [SEP] [CLS] Four deaths occurred in Tampa, three from drownings and another after a man touched a live wire. [SEP] [CLS] The storm left two additional fatalities in St. [SEP] [CLS] Petersburg. [SEP] [CLS] A number of streets in Tarpon Springs were littered with masses of debris, with many structures and trees suffering extensive damage. [SEP] [CLS] Southward in Manatee County and Sarasota County, many waterfront communities along Sarasota Bay and the Gulf of Mexico, such as Cortez and Sarasota, suffered heavy structural losses. [SEP] [CLS] Strong winds occurred as far east as the Atlantic coast of the state, though wind damage east of the Tampa Bay area was generally limited to downed trees and power lines, resulting in power outages, particularly in Orlando. [SEP] [CLS] Agriculture throughout the state experienced significant impact as well, including over $2 million (equivalent to $20 million in 2018) in damage and the loss of at least 800,000 boxes of citrus crops alone. [SEP] [CLS] Overall, the hurricane left at least eight deaths and about $10 million (equivalent to $110 million in 2018) in damage. [SEP] [CLS]
