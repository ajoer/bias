On 2 June 1994, a Chinook helicopter of the Royal Air Force (RAF), serial number ZD576, crashed on the Mull of Kintyre, Scotland, in foggy conditions. [CLS] [SEP] The crash resulted in the deaths of all twenty-five passengers and four crew on board. [CLS] [SEP] Among the passengers were almost all the United Kingdom's senior Northern Ireland intelligence experts. [CLS] [SEP] The accident is the RAF's worst peacetime disaster. [CLS] [SEP] In 1995, an RAF board of inquiry ruled that it was impossible to establish the exact cause of the accident. [CLS] [SEP] This ruling was subsequently overturned by two senior reviewing officers, who stated the pilots were guilty of gross negligence for flying too fast and too low in thick fog. [CLS] [SEP] This finding proved to be controversial, especially in light of irregularities and technical issues surrounding the then-new Chinook HC.2 variant which were uncovered. [CLS] [SEP] A Parliamentary inquiry conducted in 2001 found the previous verdict of gross negligence on the part of the crew to be 'unjustified'. [CLS] [SEP] In 2011, an independent review of the crash cleared the crew of negligence. [CLS] [SEP]
