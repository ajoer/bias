Hurricane Belle was a strong tropical cyclone that caused moderate damage across the East Coast of the United States in August 1976. [CLS] [SEP] In late July, a tropical wave emerged off the west coast of Africa. [CLS] [SEP] Traversing the Atlantic Ocean for more than a week, the system eventually consolidated into a tropical depression near the Bahamas on August 6. [CLS] [SEP] Remaining nearly stationary for a day, the depression strengthened into a tropical storm on August 7 and a hurricane later that day as it acquired a northwest motion. [CLS] [SEP] Formation of an eye accompanied quick intensification and Belle reached its peak the following day with winds of 120 mph (195 km/h). [CLS] [SEP] The hurricane subsequently turned north and accelerated, skirting the Outer Banks of North Carolina. [CLS] [SEP] Early on August 10, Belle made landfall on Long Island, New York, as a minimal hurricane crossing Long Island Sound and hitting the central coast of Connecticut as strong tropical storm. [CLS] [SEP] Thereafter, Belle transitioned into an extratropical cyclone over New England before moving over Atlantic Canada. [CLS] [SEP] The system turned east while over the north Atlantic and ultimately dissipated on August 15 to the south of Iceland. [CLS] [SEP] Threatening much of the East Coast of the United States, hurricane warnings were issued from Georgia to Maine. [CLS] [SEP] An estimated 500,000 people evacuated coastal areas accordingly. [CLS] [SEP] Overall, impacts from Belle were less than expected and mainly attributed to flooding across New England. [CLS] [SEP] Hundreds of thousands of residents lost power due to high winds. [CLS] [SEP] A total of 12 people lost their lives, mostly incidents indirectly related to the hurricane, and damage reached an estimated $100 million. [CLS] [SEP] Portions of New Jersey, New York, and Vermont were later declared major disaster areas by then-President Gerald Ford. [CLS] [SEP] Some damage also took place in New Brunswick, Canada, from heavy rain. [CLS] [SEP]
