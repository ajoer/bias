Emperor Dezong of Tang (27 May 742 â€“ 25 February 805), personal name Li Kuo, was an emperor of the Chinese Tang Dynasty and the oldest son of Emperor Daizong. [CLS] [SEP] His reign of 26 years was the third longest in the Tang dynasty (surpassed only by Emperor Xuanzong and Emperor Gaozong). [CLS] [SEP] Emperor Dezong started out as a diligent and frugal emperor and he tried to reform the governmental finances by introducing new tax laws. [CLS] [SEP] His attempts to destroy the powerful regional warlords and the subsequent mismanagement of those campaigns, however, resulted in a number of rebellions that nearly destroyed him and the Tang Dynasty. [CLS] [SEP] After those events, he dealt cautiously with the regional governors, causing warlordism to become unchecked, and his trust of eunuchs caused the eunuchs' power to rise greatly. [CLS] [SEP] He was also known for his paranoia about officials' wielding power, and late in his reign, he did not grant much authority to his chancellors. [CLS] [SEP]
