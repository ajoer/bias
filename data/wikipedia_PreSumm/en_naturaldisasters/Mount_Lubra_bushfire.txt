[CLS] The Mount Lubra bushfire, also called the Mount Warrinaburb bushfire, was a bushfire, started by a lightning strike, that burnt approximately 184,000 hectares (450,000 acres) from late on 19 January 2006 until mid-February 2006 near The Grampians in, Victoria, Australia. [SEP] [CLS] The fire burned, in difficult terrain, throughout 20â€“21 January without any serious impact. [SEP] [CLS] On 22 January, hot and dry conditions that had persisted for several days worsened. [SEP] [CLS] The fire spread rapidly in a southerly direction towards Dunkeld, south of Grampians National Park. [SEP] [CLS] The fire front reached the outskirts of Willaura (south-west of Ararat), before a strong but dry wind change took the fire back in the opposite direction. [SEP] [CLS] Winds of up to 120 kilometres per hour (75 mph) sent the fire northward extremely quickly, impacting a number of small communities along the eastern side of The Grampians, including Mafeking, Moyston, Barton, Jallukar and Pomonal. [SEP] [CLS] A man and his son died between Moyston and Pomonal when they were caught up in the fire. [SEP] [CLS] The fire was eventually controlled approximately two weeks later, having burned nearly 47% of the Grampians National Park, as well as a significant amount of private property, a total of 184,000 hectares (450,000 acres). [SEP] [CLS] Approximately 25 homes were destroyed, mostly to the west of Moyston and around Pomonal. [SEP] [CLS] Over 50 sheds and outbuildings, 1,500 kilometres (930 mi) of fencing, as well as 62,000 head of sheep and 500 head of cattle were lost to the blaze. [SEP] [CLS]
