[CLS] The 1916 Irondale earthquake struck in the northâ€“central region of the U.S. [SEP] [CLS] state of Alabama on October 18. [SEP] [CLS] The strongest earthquake in state history, it registered an estimated Richter scale magnitude of 5.1 and resulted in extensive, but minor damage. [SEP] [CLS] This damage, limited to Shelby and Jefferson counties, reached its maximum severity near the epicenter in the city of Irondale, including cracked windows, fallen chimneys, and dried-up wells. [SEP] [CLS] While there were no fatalities, the earthquake spawned widespread panic, sending alarmed workers from tall buildings. [SEP] [CLS] The earthquake originated in the Eastern Tennessee Seismic Zone, a fault noted for earthquakes of moderate magnitude. [SEP] [CLS] Faulting in the area is strike-slip-oriented, probably because of the Alabama-New York Lineament, which runs adjacent to the seismic zone. [SEP] [CLS] Several scientists believe that small earthquakes from the zone indicate the reactivation of deep, ancient faults. [SEP] [CLS] Alabama has seen roughly 20 earthquakes since the beginning of the 20th century. [SEP] [CLS] The earthquakes have been moderate, never reaching above magnitude 5.1, and they tend to cause damage only near their epicenters while reaching areas much further away. [SEP] [CLS] Major events include those in 1916, 1997, and 2003. [SEP] [CLS] Despite the lack of powerful seismic events in Alabama, earthquakes from nearby fault zones, including the New Madrid Seismic Zone, pose a serious threat to infrastructure. [SEP] [CLS] Even an earthquake similar in size to the 1916 Irondale event today could damage thousands of buildings and cause up to $1 billion in damage. [SEP] [CLS]
