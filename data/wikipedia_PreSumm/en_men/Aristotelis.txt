[CLS] Aristotle (; Greek: Ἀριστοτέλης Aristotélēs, pronounced [aristotélɛːs]; 384–322 BC) was a Greek philosopher and polymath during the Classical period in Ancient Greece. [SEP] [CLS] Taught by Plato, he was the founder of the Lyceum, the Peripatetic school of philosophy, and the Aristotelian tradition. [SEP] [CLS] His writings cover many subjects including physics, biology, zoology, metaphysics, logic, ethics, aesthetics, poetry, theatre, music, rhetoric, psychology, linguistics, economics, politics, and government. [SEP] [CLS] Aristotle provided a complex synthesis of the various philosophies existing prior to him. [SEP] [CLS] It was above all from his teachings that the West inherited its intellectual lexicon, as well as problems and methods of inquiry. [SEP] [CLS] As a result, his philosophy has exerted a unique influence on almost every form of knowledge in the West and it continues to be a subject of contemporary philosophical discussion. [SEP] [CLS] Little is known about his life. [SEP] [CLS] Aristotle was born in the city of Stagira in Northern Greece. [SEP] [CLS] His father, Nicomachus, died when Aristotle was a child, and he was brought up by a guardian. [SEP] [CLS] At seventeen or eighteen years of age he joined Plato's Academy in Athens and remained there until the age of thirty-seven (c. [SEP] [CLS] 347 BC). [SEP] [CLS] Shortly after Plato died, Aristotle left Athens and, at the request of Philip II of Macedon, tutored Alexander the Great beginning in 343 BC. [SEP] [CLS] He established a library in the Lyceum which helped him to produce many of his hundreds of books on papyrus scrolls. [SEP] [CLS] Though Aristotle wrote many elegant treatises and dialogues for publication, only around a third of his original output has survived, none of it intended for publication.Aristotle's views on physical science profoundly shaped medieval scholarship. [SEP] [CLS] Their influence extended from Late Antiquity and the Early Middle Ages into the Renaissance, and were not replaced systematically until the Enlightenment and theories such as classical mechanics were developed. [SEP] [CLS] Some of Aristotle's zoological observations found in his biology, such as on the hectocotyl (reproductive) arm of the octopus, were disbelieved until the 19th century. [SEP] [CLS] His works contain the earliest known formal study of logic, studied by medieval scholars such as Peter Abelard and John Buridan. [SEP] [CLS] Aristotle's influence on logic also continued well into the 19th century. [SEP] [CLS] He influenced Islamic thought during the Middle Ages, as well as Christian theology, especially the Neoplatonism of the Early Church and the scholastic tradition of the Catholic Church. [SEP] [CLS] Aristotle was revered among medieval Muslim scholars as "The First Teacher" and among medieval Christians like Thomas Aquinas as simply "The Philosopher". [SEP] [CLS] His ethics, though always influential, gained renewed interest with the modern advent of virtue ethics, such as in the thinking of Alasdair MacIntyre and Philippa Foot. [SEP] [CLS]
