[CLS] Antonello da Messina, properly Antonello di Giovanni di Antonio, but also called Antonello degli Antoni and Anglicized as Anthony of Messina (c. [SEP] [CLS] 1430 â€“ February 1479), was a Sicilian painter from Messina, active during the Early Italian Renaissance. [SEP] [CLS] His work shows strong influences from Early Netherlandish painting although there is no documentary evidence that he ever travelled beyond Italy. [SEP] [CLS] Giorgio Vasari credited him with the introduction of oil painting into Italy. [SEP] [CLS] Unusually for a south Italian artist of the Renaissance, his work proved influential on painters in northern Italy, especially in Venice. [SEP] [CLS]
