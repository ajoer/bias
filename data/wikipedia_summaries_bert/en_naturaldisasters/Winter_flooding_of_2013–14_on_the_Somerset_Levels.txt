From December 2013 onwards the Somerset Levels suffered severe flooding as part of the wider 2013-2014 Atlantic winter storms in Europe and subsequent 2013â€“2014 United Kingdom winter floods. [CLS] [SEP] The Somerset Levels, or the Somerset Levels and Moors as they are less commonly but more correctly known, is a coastal plain and wetland area of central Somerset, in South West England, running south from the Mendip Hills to the Blackdown Hills. [CLS] [SEP] The Levels are a low-lying area around 10 to 12 feet (3 to 4 m) above mean sea level (O.D.) which have been prone to flooding from fresh water and occasional salt water inundations. [CLS] [SEP] People have attempted to drain the area for hundreds of years. [CLS] [SEP] In the Middle Ages, the monasteries of Glastonbury, Athelney, and Muchelney reclaimed and enclosed much of the land. [CLS] [SEP] Drains and artificial rivers have been built and pumping stations installed. [CLS] [SEP] During December 2013 and January 2014 heavy rainfall led to extensive flooding with over 600 houses and 17,000 acres (6,900 ha) of agricultural land, including North Moor, Curry and Hay Moors and Greylake, affected. [CLS] [SEP] The villages of Thorney and Muchelney were cut off with many houses flooded. [CLS] [SEP] Northmoor Green, which is more commonly known as Moorland, was also severely affected. [CLS] [SEP] Flood relief activities included the use of rescue boats and the army. [CLS] [SEP] High volume pumps were brought in from the Netherlands and installed at several points to try to relieve the flooding. [CLS] [SEP] There were demands for ongoing dredging of the main rivers, although hydrology experts agreed that this would not significantly help the problem of flooding. [CLS] [SEP] Prince Charles and several senior politicians visited the area and controversy arose about the role of the Environment Agency. [CLS] [SEP] Better farming and development practices, and some drainage works, were recommended to reduce flood risks in the area. [CLS] [SEP]
