Louis IX (25 April 1214 â€“ 25 August 1270), commonly known as Saint Louis or Louis the Saint, is the only King of France to be canonized in the Catholic Church. [CLS] [SEP] Louis was crowned in Reims at the age of 12, following the death of his father Louis VIII; his mother, Blanche of Castile, ruled the kingdom as regent until he reached maturity. [CLS] [SEP] During Louis' childhood, Blanche dealt with the opposition of rebellious vassals and obtained a definitive victory in the Albigensian Crusade, which had started 20 years earlier. [CLS] [SEP] As an adult, Louis IX faced recurring conflicts with some of his realm's most powerful nobles, such as Hugh X of Lusignan and Peter of Dreux. [CLS] [SEP] Simultaneously, Henry III of England attempted to restore the Angevin continental possessions, but was promptly routed at the Battle of Taillebourg. [CLS] [SEP] Louis annexed several provinces, notably parts of Aquitaine, Maine and Provence. [CLS] [SEP] Louis IX is one of the most notable European monarchs of the Middle Ages. [CLS] [SEP] His reign is remembered as a medieval golden age in which the Kingdom of France reached an economic as well as political peak. [CLS] [SEP] His fellow European rulers esteemed him highly, not only for his military pre-eminence and the wealth of his kingdom, but for his reputation of fairness and moral integrity: he was often asked to arbitrate their disputes.He was a reformer and developed French royal justice, in which the king was the supreme judge to whom anyone could appeal to seek the amendment of a judgment. [CLS] [SEP] He banned trials by ordeal, tried to prevent the private wars that were plaguing the country, and introduced the presumption of innocence in criminal procedure. [CLS] [SEP] To enforce the application of this new legal system, Louis IX created provosts and bailiffs. [CLS] [SEP] After his unexpected recovery from a serious illness, and to honor a vow he made while ill, Louis IX led the Seventh and Eighth crusades against the Ayyubids, Bahriyya Mamluks and Hafsid Kingdom. [CLS] [SEP] He was captured in the first and ransomed. [CLS] [SEP] He died from dysentery during the latter, and was succeeded by his son Philip III. [CLS] [SEP] Louis' actions were inspired by Christian zeal and Catholic devotion. [CLS] [SEP] He was a just king: although he exacted what was due him, he had no wish to wrong anyone, from the lowest peasant to the richest vassal. [CLS] [SEP] Renowned for his moderate lifestyle, reason, bravery and chivalrous politeness, he was a splendid knight whose kindness and engaging manner made him popular. [CLS] [SEP] He was therefore regarded as the ideal Christian ruler even if he was also occasionally rebuked by contemporaries as a "monk king". [CLS] [SEP] He decided to severely punish blasphemy (for which he set the punishment to mutilation of the tongue and lips). [CLS] [SEP] He is the only canonized king of France, and there are consequently many places named after him. [CLS] [SEP]
