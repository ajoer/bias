[CLS] Macrinus (; Marcus Opellius Severus Macrinus; c. [SEP] [CLS] 165 â€“ June 218) was Roman Emperor from April 217 to 8 June 218. [SEP] [CLS] He reigned jointly with his young son Diadumenianus. [SEP] [CLS] Macrinus was by origin a Berber from Mauretania Caesariensis. [SEP] [CLS] A member of the equestrian class, he became the first emperor who did not hail from the senatorial class and was the first emperor from Mauretania. [SEP] [CLS] Before becoming emperor, Macrinus served under Emperor Caracalla as a praetorian prefect and dealt with Rome's civil affairs. [SEP] [CLS] He later conspired against Caracalla and had him murdered in a bid to protect his own life, succeeding him as emperor. [SEP] [CLS] Macrinus was proclaimed emperor of Rome by 11 April 217 while in the eastern provinces of the empire and was subsequently confirmed as such by the Senate; however, for the duration of his reign, he never had the opportunity to return to Rome. [SEP] [CLS] His predecessor's policies had left Rome's coffers empty and the empire at war with several kingdoms, including Parthia, Armenia and Dacia. [SEP] [CLS] As emperor, Macrinus first attempted to enact reform to bring economic and diplomatic stability to Rome. [SEP] [CLS] While Macrinus' diplomatic actions brought about peace with each of the individual kingdoms, the additional monetary costs and subsequent fiscal reforms generated unrest in the Roman military. [SEP] [CLS] Caracalla's aunt Julia Maesa took advantage of the unrest and instigated a rebellion to have her fourteen-year-old grandson, Elagabalus, recognized as emperor. [SEP] [CLS] Macrinus was overthrown at the Battle of Antioch on 8 June 218 and Elagabalus proclaimed himself emperor with support from the rebelling Roman legions. [SEP] [CLS] Macrinus fled the battlefield and tried to reach Rome, but was captured in Chalcedon and later executed in Cappadocia. [SEP] [CLS] He sent his son to the care of Artabanus IV of Parthia, but Diadumenianus was also captured before he could reach his destination and executed. [SEP] [CLS] After Macrinus' death, the Senate declared him and his son enemies of Rome and had their names struck from the records and their images destroyed. [SEP] [CLS]
