Lucius Varius Rufus (; c. [CLS] [SEP] 74 – 14 BC) was a Roman poet of the early Augustan age. [CLS] [SEP] He was a friend of Virgil, after whose death he and Plotius Tucca prepared the Aeneid for publication, and of Horace, for whom he and Virgil obtained an introduction to Maecenas. [CLS] [SEP] Horace spoke of him as a master of epic and the only poet capable of celebrating the achievements of Vipsanius Agrippa (Odes, i.6); Virgil (under the name of Lycidas, Ecl. [CLS] [SEP] ix.35) regretted that he had hitherto produced nothing comparable to the work of Varius or Helvius Cinna. [CLS] [SEP] Macrobius (Saturnalia, vi. [CLS] [SEP] I, 39; 2, 19) states that Varius composed an epic poem De Morte, some lines of which are quoted as having been imitated or appropriated by Virgil; Horace (Sat. [CLS] [SEP] i.10, 43) probably alluded to another epic, and, according to the scholiast on Epistles, i.16, 2 729, these three lines were taken bodily from a panegyric of Varius on Augustus. [CLS] [SEP] Varius's most famous literary production was the tragedy Thyestes, which Quintilian (Inst. [CLS] [SEP] Orat. [CLS] [SEP] x.1, 98) declared fit to rank with any of the Greek tragedies. [CLS] [SEP] The didascalia (which is preserved in a Paris manuscript) states that it was produced at the games celebrated in 29 BC by Octavian in honour of the victory at Actium, and that Varius received a present of a million sesterces from the Roman ruler. [CLS] [SEP] Fragments of Varius's works are located in E. [CLS] [SEP] Bahrens, Frag. [CLS] [SEP] Poetarum Romanorum (1886); monographs by A. [CLS] [SEP] Weichert (1836) and R. [CLS] [SEP] Unger (1870, 1878, 1898); Martin Schanz, Geschichte der römischen Litteratur (1899), ii.1; Teuffel, Hist. [CLS] [SEP] of Roman Literature (Eng. [CLS] [SEP] trans., 1900), 223.
