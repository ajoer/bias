[CLS] Severe Tropical Cyclone Larry (RSMC Nadi designation: 15F, JTWC designation: 17P) was a tropical cyclone that made landfall in Australia during the 2005â€“06 Southern Hemisphere tropical cyclone season. [SEP] [CLS] Larry originated as a low pressure system over the eastern Coral Sea on 16 March 2006, and was monitored by the Australian Bureau of Meteorology in Brisbane, Australia. [SEP] [CLS] The low-pressure area organized into a tropical cyclone two days later and quickly strengthened into a Category 4 storm on the Australian tropical cyclone scale. [SEP] [CLS] Larry made landfall in Far North Queensland close to Innisfail, on 20 March 2006, as a Category 5 tropical cyclone on the Australian scale, with wind gusts reaching 240 kilometres per hour (150 mph), before dissipating over land several days later. [SEP] [CLS] Throughout Queensland, Cyclone Larry resulted in roughly AU$1.5 billion (US$1.1 billion) in damage. [SEP] [CLS] At the time, this made Larry the costliest tropical cyclone to ever impact Australia; surpassing Cyclone Tracy in 1974 (not accounting for inflation). [SEP] [CLS]
