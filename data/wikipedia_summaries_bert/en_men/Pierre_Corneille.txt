[CLS] Pierre Corneille (French pronunciation: ​[pjɛʁ kɔʁnɛj]; 6 June 1606 – 1 October 1684) was a French tragedian. [SEP] [CLS] He is generally considered one of the three great seventeenth-century French dramatists, along with Molière and Racine. [SEP] [CLS] As a young man, he earned the valuable patronage of Cardinal Richelieu, who was trying to promote classical tragedy along formal lines, but later quarrelled with him, especially over his best-known play, Le Cid, about a medieval Spanish warrior, which was denounced by the newly formed Académie française for breaching the unities. [SEP] [CLS] He continued to write well-received tragedies for nearly forty years. [SEP] [CLS]
