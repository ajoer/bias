Hurricane Irene was a large and destructive tropical cyclone which affected much of the Caribbean and East Coast of the United States during late August 2011. [CLS] [SEP] The ninth named storm, first hurricane, and first major hurricane of the 2011 Atlantic hurricane season, Irene originated from a well-defined Atlantic tropical wave that began showing signs of organization east of the Lesser Antilles. [CLS] [SEP] Due to development of atmospheric convection and a closed center of circulation, the system was designated as Tropical Storm Irene on August 20, 2011. [CLS] [SEP] After intensifying, Irene made landfall in St. [CLS] [SEP] Croix as a strong tropical storm later that day. [CLS] [SEP] Early on August 21, the storm made a second landfall in Puerto Rico. [CLS] [SEP] While crossing the island, Irene strengthened into a Category 1 hurricane. [CLS] [SEP] The storm paralleled offshore of Hispaniola, continuing to slowly intensify in the process. [CLS] [SEP] Shortly before making four landfalls in the Bahamas, Irene peaked as a 120 mph (190 km/h) Category 3 hurricane. [CLS] [SEP] Thereafter, the storm slowly leveled off in intensity as it struck the Bahamas and then curved northward after passing east of Grand Bahama. [CLS] [SEP] Continuing to weaken, Irene was downgraded to a Category 1 hurricane before making landfall on the Outer Banks of North Carolina on August 27, becoming the first hurricane to make landfall in the United States since Hurricane Ike in 2008. [CLS] [SEP] Early on the following day, the storm re-emerged into the Atlantic from southeastern Virginia. [CLS] [SEP] Although Irene remained a hurricane over water, it weakened to a tropical storm while making yet another landfall in the Little Egg Inlet in southeastern New Jersey on August 27. [CLS] [SEP] A few hours later, Irene made its ninth and final landfall in Brooklyn, New York City. [CLS] [SEP] Early on August 29, Irene transitioned into an extratropical cyclone while striking Vermont, after remaining inland as a tropical cyclone for less than 12 hours. [CLS] [SEP] Throughout its path, Irene caused widespread destruction and at least 49 deaths. [CLS] [SEP] Damage estimates throughout the United States are estimated near $13.5 billion, making Irene one of the costliest hurricanes on record in the country. [CLS] [SEP] In addition, monetary losses in the Caribbean and Canada were $830 million and $130 million respectively for a total of nearly $14.2 billion in damage. [CLS] [SEP]
