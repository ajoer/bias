[CLS] Hurricane Roxanne was a rare and erratic tropical cyclone that caused extensive flooding in Mexico, due to its unusual movement. [SEP] [CLS] The seventeenth storm, tenth hurricane, and the fifth and final major hurricane of the very active 1995 Atlantic hurricane season, Roxanne developed in the southwestern Caribbean Sea from an area of low pressure on October 7. [SEP] [CLS] The depression curved northward, causing it to avoid landfall in Central America. [SEP] [CLS] By October 9, the depression intensified enough to be upgraded to Tropical Storm Roxanne. [SEP] [CLS] On the following day, Roxanne turned west-northward, where it promptly intensified into a hurricane. [SEP] [CLS] As Roxanne headed generally westward, it began to rapidly deepen, and reached Category 3 intensity less than 24 hours after becoming a hurricane. [SEP] [CLS] Shortly thereafter, Roxanne made landfall near Cozumel, Mexico at its peak intensity, which caused severe damage. [SEP] [CLS] Roxanne rapidly weakened while traversing the Yucatan Peninsula, and when it emerged into the Bay of Campeche on October 12, the storm was a Category 1 hurricane. [SEP] [CLS] Further weakening occurred, and Roxanne was downgraded to a tropical storm later that day. [SEP] [CLS] Roxanne tracked northwestward and eventually re-intensified into a hurricane on October 14. [SEP] [CLS] Thereafter, Roxanne began to meander erratically in the Gulf of Mexico; the storm turned abruptly southeastward, and remained nearly stationary offshore of the Yucatan Peninsula. [SEP] [CLS] Following day, Roxanne curved back northwestward and weakened back to a tropical storm on October 17. [SEP] [CLS] Roxanne completed a cyclonic loop across the Gulf of Mexico on October 18. [SEP] [CLS] Further weakening occurred, and Roxanne was downgraded to a tropical depression on October 19. [SEP] [CLS] A cold front in the Gulf of Mexico turned Roxanne abruptly southward, and the storm dissipated just offshore of Veracruz on October 21. [SEP] [CLS] Roxanne was the first October hurricane that formed and reached Category 3 intensity on the Saffir-Simpson Hurricane Scale (SSHS) in the western Caribbean Sea since Hurricane Hattie in October 1961. [SEP] [CLS] Due to its slow and erratic movement, Roxanne dropped heavy rainfall in many areas of southern Mexico, and some areas reported over 25 inches (640 mm) of precipitation. [SEP] [CLS] Heavy rainfall, in turn, led to extensive flooding, which destroyed crop, washed out roads, and damaged at least 40,000 homes. [SEP] [CLS] In addition, significant coastal flooding also occurred, as storm surge for nearly a week caused water to travel inland for hundreds of yards. [SEP] [CLS] High winds also occurred over the Yucatan Peninsula, with one station reporting hurricane-force winds on October 11. [SEP] [CLS] Overall, it is estimated that Roxanne caused $1.5 billion (1995 USD) in damage, although not all damage could be distinguished from Hurricane Opal. [SEP] [CLS] In addition, 29 fatalities were reported. [SEP] [CLS]
