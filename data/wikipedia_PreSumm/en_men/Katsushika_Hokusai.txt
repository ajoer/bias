[CLS] Katsushika Hokusai (葛飾 北斎, c. [SEP] [CLS] 31 October 1760 – 10 May 1849), known simply as Hokusai, was a Japanese artist, ukiyo-e painter and printmaker of the Edo period. [SEP] [CLS] Born in Edo (now Tokyo), Hokusai is best known as author of the woodblock print series Thirty-six Views of Mount Fuji (富嶽三十六景, Fugaku Sanjūroku-kei, c. [SEP] [CLS] 1831) which includes the internationally iconic print, The Great Wave off Kanagawa. [SEP] [CLS] Hokusai created the Thirty-Six Views both as a response to a domestic travel boom and as part of a personal obsession with Mount Fuji. [SEP] [CLS] It was this series, specifically The Great Wave print and Fine Wind, Clear Morning, that secured Hokusai's fame both in Japan and overseas. [SEP] [CLS] As historian Richard Lane concludes, "if there is one work that made Hokusai's name, both in Japan and abroad, it must be this monumental print-series". [SEP] [CLS] While Hokusai's work prior to this series is certainly important, it was not until this series that he gained broad recognition. [SEP] [CLS]
