[CLS] The 2007â€“2008 Nazko earthquakes were a series of small volcanic earthquakes measuring less than 4.0 on the Richter magnitude scale. [SEP] [CLS] They took place in the sparsely populated Nazko area of the Central Interior of British Columbia, Canada starting on October 9, 2007 and ending on June 12, 2008. [SEP] [CLS] They occurred just west of Nazko Cone, a small tree-covered cinder cone that last erupted about 7,200 years ago. [SEP] [CLS] No damage or casualties resulted from the Nazko earthquakes, which were too small to be felt by people, but local seismographs recorded them. [SEP] [CLS] The earthquake swarm occurred at the eastern end of a known volcanic zone called the Anahim Volcanic Belt. [SEP] [CLS] This is an east-west trending line of volcanic formations extending from the Central Coast to the Central Interior of British Columbia. [SEP] [CLS]
