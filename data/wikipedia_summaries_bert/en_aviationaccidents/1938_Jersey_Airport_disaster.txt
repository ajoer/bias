The 1938 Jersey Airport disaster occurred at 10:50am on Friday 4 November 1938 when the Jersey Airways de Havilland D.H.86 airliner St Catherine's Bay (G-ACZN) crashed in the parish of Saint Brélade, 500 yards east of Jersey Airport, killing the pilot and all twelve passengers on board, as well as a farmer who was working on the ground. [CLS] [SEP] In terms of loss of life, it was the worst crash of a rigid aircraft on British territory to date and the second-worst overall crash of a British rigid aircraft after the crash of an Imperial Airways airliner in Belgium in 1933 (in which 15 people died). [CLS] [SEP] The airliner had just taken off from Jersey en route to Southampton. [CLS] [SEP] The sky was overcast, with a cloud base of 120–150 feet. [CLS] [SEP] The aircraft had been fully inspected and was not carrying a full load. [CLS] [SEP] The Air Ministry investigation concluded that the accident was due to pilot error. [CLS] [SEP] The pilot had made a climbing turn into the clouds and inadvertently allowed the aircraft to sideslip when he was still too close to the ground to avert disaster. [CLS] [SEP] The aircraft had exploded and several bodies had been thrown up to 40 feet away. [CLS] [SEP] Among the dead were the daughter, son-in-law and baby granddaughter of surveyor and aerial archaeology pioneer G. [CLS] [SEP] A. [CLS] [SEP] Beazeley. [CLS] [SEP]
