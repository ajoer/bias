The 2017 Pacific hurricane season was significantly less active than the previous three Pacific hurricane seasons, featuring eighteen named storms, nine hurricanes, and four major hurricanes. [CLS] [SEP] Despite the considerable amount of activity, most of the storms were weak and short-lived. [CLS] [SEP] The season officially started on May 15 in the eastern Pacific, and on June 1 in the central Pacific; they both ended on November 30. [CLS] [SEP] These dates conventionally delimit the period of each year when most tropical cyclones form in the basin. [CLS] [SEP] However, the formation of tropical cyclones is possible at any time of the year. [CLS] [SEP] This was demonstrated when the first storm, Tropical Storm Adrian, was named on May 10, and became the earliest-known tropical storm in the East Pacific since the advent of satellite imagery. [CLS] [SEP] The season saw near-average activity in terms of Accumulated Cyclone Energy (ACE), in stark contrast to the extremely active seasons in 2014, 2015, and 2016; and for the first time since 2012, no tropical cyclones formed in the Central Pacific basin. [CLS] [SEP] However, for the third year in a row, the season featured above-average activity in July, with the ACE value being the fifth highest for the month. [CLS] [SEP] Damage across the basin reached $375.28 million (2017 USD), while 45 people were killed by the various storms. [CLS] [SEP] Beginning in 2017, the National Hurricane Center has the option to issue advisories, and thus allow watches and warnings to be issued, on disturbances that are not yet tropical cyclones but have a high chance to become one, and are expected to bring tropical storm or hurricane conditions to landmasses within 48 hours. [CLS] [SEP] Such systems are classified as "Potential Tropical Cyclones". [CLS] [SEP] This was first demonstrated in the East Pacific basin on August 29, with the designation of Potential Tropical Cyclone Fourteen-E—which later developed into Tropical Storm Lidia—south-southeast of the Baja California Peninsula.
