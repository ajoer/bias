This is an incomplete list of people and angels whom the Catholic Church has canonized as saints. [CLS] [SEP] According to Catholic theology, all saints enjoy the beatific vision; it is impossible therefore for any list to enumerate them all. [CLS] [SEP] Many of the saints listed here are to be found in the General Roman Calendar, while others may also be found in the Roman Martyrology; still others are particular to local places and their recognition does not extend to the larger worldwide church. [CLS] [SEP] Candidates go through the following four steps on the way to being declared saints. [CLS] [SEP] Saints acknowledged by the Eastern Orthodox and other churches are listed in Category:Christian saints by century and/or Category:Christian saints by nationality. [CLS] [SEP]
