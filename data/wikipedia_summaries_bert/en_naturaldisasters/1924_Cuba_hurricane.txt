The 1924 Cuba hurricane is the earliest officially classified Category 5 Atlantic hurricane on the Saffir–Simpson scale (SSHS), and one of two hurricanes to make landfall on Cuba at Category 5 intensity, the other being Hurricane Irma in 2017 – both are also tied for the strongest Cuban landfall in terms of maximum sustained winds. [CLS] [SEP] The hurricane formed on October 14 in the western Caribbean, slowly organizing as it tracked northwestward. [CLS] [SEP] By October 16, the storm attained hurricane status to the east of the Yucatán Peninsula, and subsequently executed a small counterclockwise loop. [CLS] [SEP] On October 18, the hurricane began undergoing rapid deepening and, on the next day, reached an estimated peak intensity of 165 mph (270 km/h). [CLS] [SEP] Shortly thereafter, it struck extreme western Cuba at peak intensity, becoming the strongest hurricane on record to hit the country. [CLS] [SEP] Later the hurricane weakened greatly, striking southwestern Florida with winds of 90 mph (150 km/h) in a sparsely populated region. [CLS] [SEP] While crossing the state it weakened to tropical storm status, and after accelerating east-northeastward, it was absorbed by a cold front on October 23, to the south of Bermuda. [CLS] [SEP] Across the western Caribbean Sea, the developing storm produced heavy rainfall and increased winds. [CLS] [SEP] Strong winds in western Cuba caused severe damage, with two small towns nearly destroyed. [CLS] [SEP] About 90 people were killed in the country, all in Pinar del Río Province. [CLS] [SEP] Later, the hurricane brought heavy rainfall to southern Florida, which caused flooding and crop damage. [CLS] [SEP] Damage was light in the state, and there were no casualties.
