Isabella (Armenian: Զապել, romanized: Zabel), also Isabel ( 27 January 1216/ 25 January 1217 – 23 January 1252) was queen regnant of Armenian Cilicia from 1219 until her death. [CLS] [SEP] She was proclaimed queen under the regency of Adam of Baghras. [CLS] [SEP] But he was assassinated; and Constantine of Baberon (of the Hethumian family) was nominated as guardian. [CLS] [SEP] At this juncture, Raymond-Roupen, grandson of Roupen III (the elder brother of Isabella’s father, King Leo I) set up a claim to the throne of Cilicia; but he was defeated, captured, and executed.Constantine of Barbaron was soon convinced to seek an alliance with Prince Bohemond IV of Antioch, and he arranged a marriage between the young princess and Philip, a son of Bohemond IV. [CLS] [SEP] Philip, however, offended the Armenians’ sensibilities, and even despoiled the royal palace, sending the royal crown to Antioch; therefore, he was confined in a prison in Sis (now Kozan in Turkey), where he died, presumably poisoned.The unhappy young Isabella was forced to marry Constantine of Barbaron’s son, Hethum; although for many years she refused to live with him, but in the end she relented. [CLS] [SEP] The apparent unification in marriage of the two principal dynastic forces of Cilicia (i.e., the Roupenids and the Hethumids) ended a century of dynastic and territorial rivalry and brought the Hethumids to the forefront of political dominance in Cilician Armenia. [CLS] [SEP] The lawful heiress of the empire, Isabella, governed the country together with her husband, and led a pious, religious life. [CLS] [SEP] She was blessed for her good deeds and exemplary life by many children, the numerous offsprings of a famous race. [CLS] [SEP]
