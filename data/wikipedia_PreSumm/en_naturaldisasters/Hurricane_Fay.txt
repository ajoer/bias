[CLS] Hurricane Fay was the first hurricane to make landfall on Bermuda since Emily in 1987. [SEP] [CLS] The sixth named storm and fifth hurricane of the 2014 Atlantic hurricane season, Fay evolved from a broad weather disturbance several hundred miles northeast of the Lesser Antilles on October 10. [SEP] [CLS] Initially a subtropical cyclone with an expansive wind field and asymmetrical cloud field, the storm gradually attained tropical characteristics as it turned north, transitioning into a tropical storm early on October 11. [SEP] [CLS] Despite being plagued by disruptive wind shear for most of its duration, Tropical Storm Fay steadily intensified. [SEP] [CLS] Veering toward the east, Fay briefly achieved Category 1 hurricane status while making landfall on Bermuda early on October 12. [SEP] [CLS] Wind shear eventually took its toll on Fay, causing the hurricane to weaken to a tropical storm later that day and degenerate into an open trough early on October 13. [SEP] [CLS] A few tropical cyclone warnings and watches were issued in anticipation of Fay's impact on Bermuda. [SEP] [CLS] Despite its modest strength, Fay produced extensive damage on Bermuda. [SEP] [CLS] Winds gusting over 100 mph (155 km/h) clogged roadways with downed trees and utility poles, and left a majority of the island's electric customers without power. [SEP] [CLS] The terminal building at L.F. [SEP] [CLS] Wade International Airport was flooded after the storm compromised its roof and sprinkler system. [SEP] [CLS] Along the coast, the storm unmoored and destroyed numerous boats. [SEP] [CLS] Immediately after the hurricane, 200 Bermuda Regiment soldiers were called to clear debris and assist in initial damage repairs. [SEP] [CLS] Cleanup efforts overlapped with preparations for the approach of the stronger Hurricane Gonzalo, which struck the island less than six days later and compounded the damage. [SEP] [CLS] Fay and Gonzalo marked the first recorded instance of two Bermuda hurricane landfalls in one season. [SEP] [CLS]
