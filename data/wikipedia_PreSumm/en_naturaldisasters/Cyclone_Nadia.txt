[CLS] Cyclone Nadia was a powerful tropical cyclone that struck both Madagascar and Mozambique in March 1994. [SEP] [CLS] It formed on March 16 and moved westward for the first ten days of its duration. [SEP] [CLS] Warm waters and low wind shear allowed for the storm to gradually strengthen. [SEP] [CLS] After developing a well-defined eye, Nadia intensified to reach winds of 175 km/h (110 mph 10 minute sustained) early on March 22, according to Météo-France (MF). [SEP] [CLS] In contrast, the Joint Typhoon Warning Center (JTWC) estimated winds of about 220 km/h (140 mph 1 minute sustained). [SEP] [CLS] On March 23, the cyclone struck northern Madagascar, causing flooding and localized damage where it moved ashore. [SEP] [CLS] There were 12 deaths in the country. [SEP] [CLS] Nadia emerged into the Mozambique Channel as a weakened storm, although it reintensified slightly before making landfall in northeastern Mozambique on March 24. [SEP] [CLS] The storm turned southward through the country, emerging over water on March 26. [SEP] [CLS] It turned to the northeast and meandered over waters before dissipating on April 1. [SEP] [CLS] Damage was heaviest in Mozambique, estimated at about $20 million (1994 USD). [SEP] [CLS] Cyclone Nadia severely affected four provinces in the country, primarily Nampula Province where it moved ashore. [SEP] [CLS] There, 85% of the houses were destroyed, and across its path, the cyclone left 1.5 million people homeless. [SEP] [CLS] High winds caused widespread power outages, left areas without water, and significantly damaged crops, notably the cashew crop. [SEP] [CLS] The storm struck before the harvest, and lack of food resulted in 300 deaths in the months after the storm. [SEP] [CLS] Across Mozambique, Nadia directly caused 240 deaths and injured thousands. [SEP] [CLS] Effects spread as far inland as Malawi. [SEP] [CLS]
