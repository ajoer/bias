[CLS] Air India Flight 182 was an Air India flight operating on the Montreal–London–Delhi route. [SEP] [CLS] On 23 June 1985 it was operated using Boeing 747-237B registered VT-EFO. [SEP] [CLS] It disintegrated in midair en route from Montreal to London, at an altitude of 31,000 feet (9,400 m) over the Atlantic Ocean, as a result of the explosion from a bomb planted by Khalistani Canadians, Sikh terrorists. [SEP] [CLS] The remnants of the airliner fell into the ocean approximately 120 miles (190 km) west-southwest of the southwest tip of Ireland, killing all aboard: 329 people, including 268 Canadian citizens, 27 British citizens and 24 Indian citizens. [SEP] [CLS] The bombing of Air India Flight 182 is the largest mass killing in Canadian history, the deadliest aviation accident in the history of Air India and was the deadliest act of aviation terrorism until the September 11 attacks in 2001. [SEP] [CLS] The Babbar Khalsa terror group was implicated in the bombings.The bombing of this flight coincided with the Narita Airport bombing. [SEP] [CLS] Investigators believe the two plots were linked, and that those responsible were aiming for a double aircraft bombing. [SEP] [CLS] However, the bomb at Narita exploded before it could be loaded onto the plane. [SEP] [CLS] Although a handful of members were arrested and tried for the Air India bombing, the only person convicted was Inderjit Singh Reyat, a Canadian national and a member of the ISYF, who pleaded guilty in 2003 to manslaughter. [SEP] [CLS] He was sentenced to fifteen years in prison for assembling the bombs that exploded on board Air India Flight 182 and at Narita.The subsequent investigation and prosecution lasted almost twenty years. [SEP] [CLS] This was the most expensive trial in Canadian history, costing nearly C$130 million. [SEP] [CLS] The Governor General-in-Council in 2006 appointed the former Supreme Court Justice John C. [SEP] [CLS] Major to conduct a commission of inquiry. [SEP] [CLS] His report, which was completed and released on 17 June 2010, concluded that a "cascading series of errors" by the Government of Canada, the Royal Canadian Mounted Police (RCMP), and the Canadian Security Intelligence Service (CSIS) had allowed the terrorist attack to take place.
