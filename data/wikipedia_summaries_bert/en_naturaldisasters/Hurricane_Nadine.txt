[CLS] Hurricane Nadine was the fourth-longest-lived Atlantic hurricane on record. [SEP] [CLS] The fourteenth tropical cyclone and named storm of the 2012 Atlantic hurricane season, Nadine developed from a tropical wave west of Cape Verde on September 10. [SEP] [CLS] By the following day, it had strengthened into Tropical Storm Nadine. [SEP] [CLS] After initially tracking northwestward, Nadine turned northward, well away from any landmass. [SEP] [CLS] Early on September 15, Nadine reached hurricane status as it was curving eastward. [SEP] [CLS] Soon after, an increase in vertical wind shear weakened Nadine and by September 16 it was back to a tropical storm. [SEP] [CLS] On the following day, the storm began moving northeastward and threatened the Azores but late on September 19, Nadine veered east-southeastward before reaching the islands. [SEP] [CLS] Nonetheless, the storm produced tropical storm force winds on a few islands. [SEP] [CLS] On September 21, the storm curved south-southeastward while south of the Azores. [SEP] [CLS] Later that day, Nadine transitioned into a non-tropical low pressure area. [SEP] [CLS] Due to favorable conditions, the remnants of Nadine regenerated into a tropical cyclone on September 24. [SEP] [CLS] After re-developing, the storm executed a cyclonic loop and meandered slowly across the eastern Atlantic. [SEP] [CLS] Eventually, Nadine turned south-southwestward, at which time it became nearly stationary. [SEP] [CLS] By September 28, the storm curved northwestward and re-strengthened into a hurricane. [SEP] [CLS] The tenacious cyclone intensified further and peaked with winds of 90 mph (140 km/h) on September 30. [SEP] [CLS] By the following day, however, Nadine weakened back to a 65 mph (105 km/h) tropical storm, as conditions became increasingly unfavorable. [SEP] [CLS] Strong wind shear and decreasing sea surface temperatures significantly weakened the storm. [SEP] [CLS] Nadine transitioned into an extratropical cyclone on October 3, and merged with an approaching cold front northeast of the Azores soon after. [SEP] [CLS] The remnants of Nadine passed through the Azores on October 4 and again brought relatively strong winds to the islands. [SEP] [CLS]
