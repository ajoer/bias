Typhoon Morakot, known in the Philippines as Typhoon Kiko, was the deadliest typhoon to impact Taiwan in recorded history. [CLS] [SEP] The eighth named storm and fourth typhoon of the 2009 Pacific typhoon season, Morakot wrought catastrophic damage in Taiwan, leaving 673 people dead and 26 missing, and causing roughly NT$110 billion (US$3.3 billion) in damages. [CLS] [SEP] The storm produced copious amounts of rainfall, peaking at 2,777 mm (109.3 in), far surpassing the previous record of 1,736 mm (68.35 in) set by Typhoon Herb in 1996. [CLS] [SEP] The extreme amount of rain triggered enormous mudflows and severe flooding throughout southern Taiwan. [CLS] [SEP] One landslide (and subsequent flood) destroyed the entire town of Siaolin, killing over 400 people. [CLS] [SEP] The slow-moving storm also caused widespread damage in China, leaving eight people dead and causing $1.4 billion (2009 USD) in damages. [CLS] [SEP] Nearly 2,000 homes were destroyed in the country and 136,000 more were reported to have sustained damage. [CLS] [SEP] In the wake of the storm, Taiwan's government faced extreme criticism for the slow response to the disaster and having only initially deployed roughly 2,100 soldiers to the affected regions. [CLS] [SEP] Later, the number of soldiers working to recover trapped residents increased to 46,000. [CLS] [SEP] Rescue crews were able to retrieve thousands of trapped residents from buried villages and isolated towns across the island. [CLS] [SEP] Days later, Taiwan's president Ma Ying-jeou apologized for the government's slow response publicly. [CLS] [SEP] On August 19, the Taiwan government announced that they would start a NT$100 billion (US$3 billion) reconstruction plan that would take place over a three-year span in the devastated regions of southern Taiwan. [CLS] [SEP] Days after the storm, international aid began to be sent to the island.
