[CLS] Mahakörgis or Markörgis (Mongolian: Махагүргис хаан, Mongolian Language: ᠮᠠᠬᠠᠺᠥᠷᠭᠢᠰ ᠬᠠᠭᠠᠨ ; Chinese: 馬兒古兒吉思; 1448–1465) was a Mongol Khan of the Northern Yuan dynasty based in Mongolia. [SEP] [CLS] Some scholars believe his name is a Christian name. [SEP] [CLS] Mahakörgis was the youngest son of Tayisung Khan Toghtoa Bukha and his youngest khatun, Samar. [SEP] [CLS] Soon after Esen was killed, his mother, Samar, attacked the Four Oirads in the Khangai Zavkhan. [SEP] [CLS] During the campaign, 8 year-old Mahakörgis was taken in a box on horseback, thus to be later called Ükegtü Khagan. [SEP] [CLS] They defeated the Oirads and returned with plundered goods. [SEP] [CLS] After that Samar taifu and Dogholon taishi of the seven Tümeds crowned the boy Khagan. [SEP] [CLS] Bulay of the Kharchin and Dogholon held the real power, and constantly fought each other for dominance. [SEP] [CLS] Mahakörgis was given the title Ükegtü because he sat inside a cart during the battles. [SEP] [CLS] Bulay tried to open trade relations with Ming China but was declined. [SEP] [CLS] Bulay repeatedly invaded China in 1460 and 1461. [SEP] [CLS] He also attacked the Uriyangkhai Doyin guard (tributary of the Ming) in the next year. [SEP] [CLS] The Ming court finally agreed to establish peace with the Mongols. [SEP] [CLS] In 1465, the Mongol nobles openly went to war against each other in their power struggle and Mahakörgis Ükegtü Khan was killed as a result. [SEP] [CLS] The young khan was succeeded by his eldest half-brother Molon Khan Tögüs Mengke. [SEP] [CLS]
