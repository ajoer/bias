[CLS] The November 2016 Vietnam tropical depression caused heavy flooding throughout central and southern Vietnam. [SEP] [CLS] Forming out from a low-pressure system on November 3, the Japan Meteorological Agency (JMA) began monitoring it as a tropical depression. [SEP] [CLS] With favorable conditions aloft and an increase of organization, the JMA predicted that it had a chance of becoming a tropical storm while the Joint Typhoon Warning Center (JTWC) in the same time issued a Tropical Cyclone Formation Alert on November 4. [SEP] [CLS] Due to its proximity to land and a circulation displaced from the deep convection, both the JMA and the JTWC canceled their warnings as it made landfall over in Southern Vietnam. [SEP] [CLS] The system continued moving westward over land and the JMA stopped tracking on the system on November 6. [SEP] [CLS] Although the system did not reach tropical storm intensity, the system helped worsen the effects from the flooding that occurred during mid October. [SEP] [CLS] Reports after the storm had stated that a total of 15 people were dead while 6 are still missing. [SEP] [CLS] Large areas of cropland were inundated by the waters and numerous homes were damaged. [SEP] [CLS] Damages from the system were estimated at â‚«1.073 trillion ($48.1 million USD). [SEP] [CLS] Some say that Vietnam had its worst flooding since 2011. [SEP] [CLS]
