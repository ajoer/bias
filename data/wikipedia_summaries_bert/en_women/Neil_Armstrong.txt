Neil Alden Armstrong (August 5, 1930 â€“ August 25, 2012) was an American astronaut and aeronautical engineer and the first person to walk on the Moon. [CLS] [SEP] He was also a naval aviator, test pilot, and university professor. [CLS] [SEP] A graduate of Purdue University, Armstrong studied aeronautical engineering; his college tuition was paid for by the U.S. [CLS] [SEP] Navy under the Holloway Plan. [CLS] [SEP] He became a midshipman in 1949 and a naval aviator the following year. [CLS] [SEP] He saw action in the Korean War, flying the Grumman F9F Panther from the aircraft carrier USS Essex. [CLS] [SEP] In September 1951, while making a low bombing run, Armstrong's aircraft was damaged when it collided with an anti-aircraft cable which cut off a large portion of one wing. [CLS] [SEP] Armstrong was forced to bail out. [CLS] [SEP] After the war, he completed his bachelor's degree at Purdue and became a test pilot at the National Advisory Committee for Aeronautics (NACA) High-Speed Flight Station at Edwards Air Force Base in California. [CLS] [SEP] He was the project pilot on Century Series fighters and flew the North American X-15 seven times. [CLS] [SEP] He was also a participant in the U.S. [CLS] [SEP] Air Force's Man in Space Soonest and X-20 Dyna-Soar human spaceflight programs. [CLS] [SEP] Armstrong joined the NASA Astronaut Corps in the second group, which was selected in 1962. [CLS] [SEP] He made his first spaceflight as command pilot of Gemini 8 in March 1966, becoming NASA's first civilian astronaut to fly in space. [CLS] [SEP] During this mission with pilot David Scott, he performed the first docking of two spacecraft; the mission was aborted after Armstrong used some of his re-entry control fuel to stabilize a dangerous roll caused by a stuck thruster. [CLS] [SEP] During training for Armstrong's second and last spaceflight as commander of Apollo 11, he had to eject from the Lunar Landing Research Vehicle moments before a crash. [CLS] [SEP] On July 20, 1969, Armstrong and Apollo 11 Lunar Module (LM) pilot Buzz Aldrin became the first people to land on the Moon, and the next day they spent two and a half hours outside the Lunar Module Eagle spacecraft while Michael Collins remained in lunar orbit in the Apollo Command Module Columbia. [CLS] [SEP] When Armstrong stepped onto the lunar surface, he famously said: "That's one small step for [a] man, one giant leap for mankind." Along with Collins and Aldrin, Armstrong was awarded the Presidential Medal of Freedom by President Richard Nixon. [CLS] [SEP] President Jimmy Carter presented Armstrong with the Congressional Space Medal of Honor in 1978, and Armstrong and his former crewmates received a Congressional Gold Medal in 2009. [CLS] [SEP] After he resigned from NASA in 1971, Armstrong taught in the Department of Aerospace Engineering at the University of Cincinnati until 1979. [CLS] [SEP] He served on the Apollo 13 accident investigation and on the Rogers Commission, which investigated the Space Shuttle Challenger disaster. [CLS] [SEP] He acted as a spokesman for several businesses and appeared in advertising for the automotive brand Chrysler starting in January 1979. [CLS] [SEP]
