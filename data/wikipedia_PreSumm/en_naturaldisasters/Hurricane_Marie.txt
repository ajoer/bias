[CLS] Hurricane Marie is tied as the seventh-most intense Pacific hurricane on record, attaining a barometric pressure of 918 mbar (hPa; 27.11 inHg) in August 2014 and the sixth-most intense tropical cyclone worldwide in 2014. [SEP] [CLS] On August 10, a tropical wave emerged off the west coast of Africa over the Atlantic Ocean. [SEP] [CLS] Some organization of shower and thunderstorm activity initially took place, but dry air soon impinged upon the system and imparted weakening. [SEP] [CLS] The wave tracked westward across the Atlantic and Caribbean for several days. [SEP] [CLS] On August 19, an area of low pressure consolidated within the wave west of Central America. [SEP] [CLS] With favorable atmospheric conditions, convective activity and banding features increased around the system and by August 22, the system acquired enough organization to be classified as Tropical Depression Thirteen-E while situated about 370 mi (595 km) south-southeast of Acapulco, Mexico. [SEP] [CLS] Development was initially fast-paced, as the depression acquired tropical storm-force winds within six hours of formation and hurricane-force by August 23. [SEP] [CLS] However, due to some vertical wind shear its intensification rate stalled, and for a time it remained a Category 1 hurricane on the Saffirâ€“Simpson hurricane wind scale. [SEP] [CLS] On August 24, Marie developed an eye and rapidly intensified to a Category 5 hurricane with winds of 160 mph (260 km/h). [SEP] [CLS] At its peak, the hurricane's gale-force winds spanned an area 575 mi (925 km) across. [SEP] [CLS] Marie subsequently underwent an eyewall replacement cycle on August 25 which prompted steady weakening. [SEP] [CLS] Over the next several days, Marie progressively degraded to below hurricane strength as it moved into an increasingly hostile environment with cooler waters and a more stable atmosphere. [SEP] [CLS] On August 29, after having lost all signs of organized deep convection, Marie degenerated into a remnant low. [SEP] [CLS] The large system gradually wound down over the following several days, with winds subsiding below gale-force on August 30. [SEP] [CLS] The remnant cyclone eventually lost a well defined center and dissipated on September 2 about 1,200 mi (1,950 km) northeast of Hawaii. [SEP] [CLS] Although Marie's center remained well away from land throughout its entire existence, its large size brought increased surf to areas from Southwestern Mexico northward to southern California. [SEP] [CLS] Off the coast of Los Cabos, three people drowned after their boat capsized in rough seas. [SEP] [CLS] In Colima and Oaxaca, heavy rains from outer bands caused flooding, resulting in two fatalities. [SEP] [CLS] Similar effects were felt across Baja California Sur. [SEP] [CLS] Toward the end of August, Marie brought one of the largest hurricane-related surf events to southern California in decades. [SEP] [CLS] Swells of 10 to 15 ft (3.0 to 4.6 m) battered coastal areas, with structural damage occurring on Santa Catalina Island and in the Greater Los Angeles Area. [SEP] [CLS] A breakwater near Long Beach sustained $10 million worth of damage, with portions gouged out. [SEP] [CLS] One person drowned in the surf near Malibu. [SEP] [CLS] Hundreds of ocean rescues, including over 100 in Malibu alone, were attributed to the storm, and overall losses reached $20 million. [SEP] [CLS]
