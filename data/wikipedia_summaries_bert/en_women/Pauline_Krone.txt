The krone (Danish pronunciation: [ˈkʰʁoːnə]; plural: kroner; sign: kr.; code: DKK) is the official currency of Denmark, Greenland, and the Faroe Islands, introduced on 1 January 1875. [CLS] [SEP] Both the ISO code "DKK" and currency sign "kr." are in common use; the former precedes the value, the latter in some contexts follows it. [CLS] [SEP] The currency is sometimes referred to as the Danish crown in English, since krone literally means crown. [CLS] [SEP] Historically, krone coins have been minted in Denmark since the 17th century. [CLS] [SEP] One krone is subdivided into 100 øre (Danish pronunciation: [ˈøːɐ]; singular and plural), the name øre is probably derived from the Roman word for gold. [CLS] [SEP] Altogether there are eleven denominations of the krone, with the smallest being the 50 øre coin (one half of a krone). [CLS] [SEP] Formerly there were more øre coins, but those were discontinued due to inflation. [CLS] [SEP] The krone is pegged to the euro via the ERM II, the European Union's exchange rate mechanism. [CLS] [SEP] Adoption of the euro is favoured by some of the major political parties, however a 2000 referendum on joining the Eurozone was defeated with 53.2% voting to maintain the krone and 46.8% voting to join the Eurozone.
