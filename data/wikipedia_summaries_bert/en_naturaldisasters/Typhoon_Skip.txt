[CLS] Typhoon Skip, known in the Philippines as Typhoon Yoning, was the final of three tropical cyclones in 1988 to directly impact the Philippines in a two-week time frame. [SEP] [CLS] Several areas of disturbed weather developed within the monsoon trough around November 1. [SEP] [CLS] One area situated to the south of Guam gradually became better organized, and by late November 3, the system was upgraded into a tropical depression, and a tropical storm later that day. [SEP] [CLS] Steady deepening ensued as Skip veered west and the cyclone was upgraded into a typhoon on November 5. [SEP] [CLS] The next day, Skip attained its maximum intensity of 145 km/h (90 mph). [SEP] [CLS] Shortly after its peak, weakening ensued as the storm tracked across the Philippines. [SEP] [CLS] This trend continued once the cyclone entered the South China Sea, initially as a severe tropical storm late on November 7. [SEP] [CLS] Slowing down in forward motion, Skip briefly turned west-northwest, then west and finally turned west-southwest before dissipating on November 12. [SEP] [CLS] Typhoon Skip brought widespread impact to much of the already battered country. [SEP] [CLS] On Cebu island, almost 20,000 people were trapped in floodwaters. [SEP] [CLS] Along the slope of the Mayon Volcano, 2,600 people had to be evacuated due to a landslide. [SEP] [CLS] On the remote island of Palawan, 74 people were killed.

[SEP] [CLS] Seventeen homes were demolished, and two people were confirmed to have been killed because of a landslide in Pasacao in the province of Camarines Sur. [SEP] [CLS] Throughout the city, ten people perished. [SEP] [CLS] Throughout the province, up to 27 people died and at least 20 others were hurt.
