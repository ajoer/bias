[CLS] The 2003 Fiordland earthquake struck the remote region of Fiordland in the South Island of New Zealand on 22 August 2003 at 0.12 am. [SEP] [CLS] The epicentre was 12 km deep, and was thought to be near Secretary Island at the entrance to Doubtful Sound. [SEP] [CLS] This was the same location as an earthquake of 6.7 Ms magnitude on 10 August 1993.At 7.2 Ms magnitude it was one of the largest quakes in the country for some time, and was the largest shallow quake since the 1968 Inangahua earthquake. [SEP] [CLS] There was an aftershock two hours later at 2.12 am, followed over several days by frequent small tremors; up to 21 September there were 6365 aftershocks. [SEP] [CLS] Fiordland is one of the seismically active parts of the country according to GNS seismologist Dr Warwick Smith, as they are a relief mechanism for stresses as the Australian and Pacific tectonic plates are being forced together in the area, with the Pacific Plate subducting under the Australian Plate.In August 2004 there was another large earthquake of magnitude 7.1 MW in Fiordland.
