[CLS] Charles Bally (French: [bɑji]; 4 February 1865, Geneva – 10 April 1947, Geneva) was a Swiss linguist from the Geneva School. [SEP] [CLS] He lived from 1865 to 1947 and was, like Ferdinand de Saussure, from Switzerland. [SEP] [CLS] His parents were Jean Gabriel, a teacher, and Henriette, the owner of a cloth store. [SEP] [CLS] Bally was married three times: first to Valentine Leirens, followed by Irma Baptistine Doutre, who was sent into a mental institution in 1915, and finally with Alice Bellicot. [SEP] [CLS] In addition to his edition of de Saussure's lectures, Course in General Linguistics (co-edited by Albert Sechehaye), Charles Bally also played an important role in linguistics. [SEP] [CLS] From 1883 to 1885 he studied classical languages and literature in Geneva. [SEP] [CLS] He continued his studies from 1886 to 1889 in Berlin where he was awarded a Ph.D. [SEP] [CLS] After his studies he worked as a private teacher for the royal family of Greece from 1889 to 1893. [SEP] [CLS] Bally returned to Geneva and taught at a business school from 1893 on and moved to the Progymnasium, a grammar school, from 1913 to 1939. [SEP] [CLS] He also worked as PD at the university from 1893 to 1913. [SEP] [CLS] From 1913 to 1939 he had a professorship for general linguistic and comparative Indo-European studies which he took over from Ferdinand de Saussure. [SEP] [CLS] Besides his works about subjecthood in the French language he also wrote about the crisis in French language and language classes. [SEP] [CLS] He was active in interlinguistics, serving as a consultant to the research association that presented Interlingua in 1951. [SEP] [CLS] Today Charles Bally is regarded as the founding-father of linguistic theories of style and much honored for his theories of phraseology. [SEP] [CLS] In terms of modern stylistics he dealt with the expressive function of signs. [SEP] [CLS]
