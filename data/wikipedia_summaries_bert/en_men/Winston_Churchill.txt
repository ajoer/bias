[CLS] [SEP] Apart from two years between 1922 and 1924, Churchill was a Member of Parliament (MP) from 1900 to 1964 and represented a total of five constituencies. [CLS] [SEP] Ideologically an economic liberal and imperialist, he was for most of his career a member of the Conservative Party, as leader from 1940 to 1955. [CLS] [SEP] He was a member of the Liberal Party from 1904 to 1924. [CLS] [SEP] Of mixed English and American parentage, Churchill was born in Oxfordshire to a wealthy, aristocratic family. [CLS] [SEP] He joined the British Army in 1895 and saw action in British India, the Anglo-Sudan War, and the Second Boer War, gaining fame as a war correspondent and writing books about his campaigns. [CLS] [SEP] Elected a Conservative MP in 1900, he defected to the Liberals in 1904. [CLS] [SEP] In H. [CLS] [SEP] H. [CLS] [SEP] Asquith's Liberal government, Churchill served as President of the Board of Trade and Home Secretary, championing prison reform and workers' social security.

[CLS] [SEP] He resigned in November 1915 and joined the Royal Scots Fusiliers on the Western Front for six months. [CLS] [SEP] In 1917, he returned to government under David Lloyd George and served successively as Minister of Munitions, Secretary of State for War, Secretary of State for Air, and Secretary of State for the Colonies, overseeing the Anglo-Irish Treaty and British foreign policy in the Middle East. [CLS] [SEP] After two years out of Parliament, he served as Chancellor of the Exchequer in Stanley Baldwin's Conservative government, returning the pound sterling in 1925 to the gold standard at its pre-war parity, a move widely seen as creating deflationary pressure and depressing the UK economy. [CLS] [SEP] Out of office during the 1930s, Churchill took the lead in calling for British rearmament to counter the growing threat of militarism in Nazi Germany. [CLS] [SEP] At the outbreak of the Second World War he was re-appointed First Lord of the Admiralty. [CLS] [SEP] In May 1940, he became Prime Minister, replacing Neville Chamberlain.

[CLS] [SEP] After the Conservatives' defeat in the 1945 general election, he became Leader of the Opposition. [CLS] [SEP] Amid the developing Cold War with the Soviet Union, he publicly warned of an "iron curtain" of Soviet influence in Europe and promoted European unity. [CLS] [SEP] Re-elected Prime Minister in 1951, his second term was preoccupied with foreign affairs, especially Anglo-American relations and, despite ongoing decolonisation, preservation of the British Empire. [CLS] [SEP] Domestically, his government emphasised house-building and developed a nuclear weapon. [CLS] [SEP] In declining health, Churchill resigned as Prime Minister in 1955, although he remained an MP until 1964. [CLS] [SEP] Upon his death in 1965, he was given a state funeral. [CLS] [SEP] Widely considered one of the 20th century's most significant figures, Churchill remains popular in the UK and Western world, where he is seen as a victorious wartime leader who played an important role in defending Europe's liberal democracy from the spread of fascism. [CLS] [SEP] Also praised as a social reformer and writer, among his many awards was the Nobel Prize in Literature. [CLS] [SEP] Conversely, he has been widely criticised for some wartime events, notably the 1945 bombing of Dresden, and in recent years his imperialist views and certain comments on race have generated controversy.
