Wanyan Yongji (died 11 September 1213), courtesy name Xingsheng, was the seventh emperor of the Jurchen-led Jin dynasty, which ruled northern China between the 12th and 13th centuries. [CLS] [SEP] He reigned for about five years from 1208 until 1213, when he was assassinated by the general Heshilie Zhizhong. [CLS] [SEP] Despite having ruled as an emperor, Wanyan Yongji was not posthumously honoured as an emperor. [CLS] [SEP] Instead, in 1216, his successor, Emperor Xuanzong, reverted his status back to "Prince of Wei" (衛王) – the title Wanyan Yongji held before he became emperor – and gave him the posthumous name "Shao" (紹), hence Wanyan Yongji is historically referred to as "Prince Shao of Wei" (or Wei Shao Wang).
