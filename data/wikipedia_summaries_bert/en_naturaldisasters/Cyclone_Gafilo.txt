Very Intense Tropical Cyclone Gafilo (French pronunciation: ​[ɡafil]; also known as Cyclone Gafilo) was both the most intense tropical cyclone ever recorded in the South-West Indian Ocean and the most intense tropical cyclone worldwide in 2004. [CLS] [SEP] Being unusually large and intense, Gafilo was the deadliest and most destructive cyclone of the 2003–04 South-West Indian Ocean cyclone season. [CLS] [SEP] According to the EM-DAT International Disaster Database, Gafilo killed at least 363 people. [CLS] [SEP] Gafilo also caused about $250 million (2004 USD) damages in Madagascar, which makes it one of most devastating storms to hit the country on reliable record. [CLS] [SEP] Forming south of Diego Garcia, it intensified into a moderate tropical storm on 3 March. [CLS] [SEP] One day later, Gafilo became a tropical cyclone, and it ultimately intensified into a very intense tropical cyclone on 6 March, prior to making landfall over Madagascar early on the next day. [CLS] [SEP] After crossing the island, Gafilo emerged into the Mozambique Channel and made landfall over Madagascar again on 9 March. [CLS] [SEP] After a three-day loop overland, the system arrived at the Indian Ocean on 13 March, and it transitioned into a subtropical depression on 14 March. [CLS] [SEP] Gafilo then became extratropical on the next day and weakened, before dissipating on 18 March. [CLS] [SEP]
