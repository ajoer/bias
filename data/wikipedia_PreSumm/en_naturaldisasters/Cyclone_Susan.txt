[CLS] Severe Tropical Cyclone Susan was one of the most intense tropical cyclones on record within the South Pacific basin, which was first noted on December 20, 1997, as a weak tropical disturbance located to the north of American Samoa. [SEP] [CLS] Over the next 12 days, the disturbance remained weak while it gradually moved towards the southwest before it started to rapidly develop on January 2, 1998 while it was located near the Fijian dependency of Rotuma. [SEP] [CLS] The disturbance was declared a tropical cyclone later that day, but was not named Susan until the next day, after it had intensified into a category 2 tropical cyclone on the Australian Scale. [SEP] [CLS] Over the next few days, Susan moved towards the southwest and continued to intensify before it reached its peak intensity as a category five tropical cyclone during January 5 while it was located about 400 km (250 mi) to the northwest of Vanuatu's capital city Port Vila. [SEP] [CLS] At this stage as the cyclone was moving towards the southwest it posed a severe threat to Vanuatu however, during that day Susan recurved towards the southeast and subsequently spared Vanuatu a direct hit. [SEP] [CLS] After sparing Vanuatu a direct hit, Susan started to accelerate towards the southeast and while starting to weaken significantly passed close enough to Fiji during January 7 and 8 to cause gale-force winds in Fiji's southern and western islands. [SEP] [CLS] While continuing to move towards the southeast, Susan started to interact with Severe Tropical Cyclone Ron during January 8 before it absorbed Ron by 0600 UTC the next day and starting to transition into an extratropical cyclone. [SEP] [CLS] The extratropical remnants of the combined systems were then monitored for another day until they were last noted on January 10, bringing an unseasonable cold snap to New Zealand. [SEP] [CLS] Despite sparing Vanuatu and Fiji direct hits, heavy rain and gale-force winds associated with Susan were reported to have caused minor damage to several Vanuatuan and Fijian islands. [SEP] [CLS] These islands included Viti Levu where a possible tornado destroyed the roof of a shopping centre and the Vanuatuan island of Ambrym, where a woman died after being hit by a falling coconut tree, while gathering supplies to secure her house with.
