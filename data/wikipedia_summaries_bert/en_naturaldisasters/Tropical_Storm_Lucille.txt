Tropical Storm Lucille was the first tropical cyclone to have its name retired in the Western Pacific basin. [CLS] [SEP] Lucille was identified as a weak tropical depression on May 25, 1960, to the east of the Philippines. [CLS] [SEP] Tracking northwestward, the system failed to develop and warnings on it were discontinued on May 27. [CLS] [SEP] At the same time, a second system began organizing along the west coast of Luzon. [CLS] [SEP] The two systems ultimately merged into one over the Philippines between May 28 and 29. [CLS] [SEP] Now tracking northeastward, the system re-intensified and became a tropical storm on May 30. [CLS] [SEP] Lucille attained its peak intensity later that day with winds of 85 km/h (50 mph). [CLS] [SEP] As it accelerated over open waters, the system brushed the islands of Iwo Jima and Chichi-jima before transitioning into an extratropical cyclone on June 1. [CLS] [SEP] The remnants of Lucille were last noted on June 4 near the International Date Line. [CLS] [SEP] Between May 27 and 29, heavy rains fell across much of Luzon as Lucille developed. [CLS] [SEP] These rains, amounting to 406 mm (16 in) in the suburbs of Manila, triggered destructive floods that left some areas under 4.6 m (15 ft) of water. [CLS] [SEP] The worst of the floods took place during the overnight hours of May 28 to 29. [CLS] [SEP] During that time, hundreds of homes were swept away and an estimated 300â€“500 people, including at least 80 children, were killed. [CLS] [SEP] Monetary losses from the floods exceeded $2 million. [CLS] [SEP]
