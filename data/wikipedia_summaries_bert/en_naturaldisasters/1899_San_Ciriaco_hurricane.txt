The 1899 San Ciríaco hurricane, also known as the 1899 Puerto Rico Hurricane or The Great Bahamas Hurricane of 1899, was the longest-lived Atlantic hurricane on record, and the second-longest-lived tropical cyclone globally on record (in terms of tropical duration) after 1994's Hurricane John in the Pacific. [CLS] [SEP] It was also one of the deadliest Atlantic hurricanes in recorded history, with an estimated 3,800 fatalities. [CLS] [SEP] The third tropical cyclone and first major hurricane of the season, this storm was first observed southwest of Cape Verde on August 3. [CLS] [SEP] It slowly strengthened while heading steadily west-northwestward across the Atlantic Ocean and reached hurricane status by late on August 5. [CLS] [SEP] During the following 48 hours, it deepened further, reaching Category 4 on the modern day Saffir–Simpson hurricane wind scale (SSHWS) before crossing the Leeward Islands on August 7. [CLS] [SEP] Later that day, the storm peaked winds of 150 mph (240 km/h). [CLS] [SEP] The storm weakened slightly before making landfall in Guayama, Puerto Rico with winds of 140 mph (220 km/h) on August 8. [CLS] [SEP] Several hours later, it emerged into the southwestern Atlantic as a Category 3 hurricane. [CLS] [SEP] The system paralleled the north coast of Dominican Republic and then crossed the Bahamas, striking several islands. [CLS] [SEP] Thereafter, it began heading northward on August 14, while centered east of Florida. [CLS] [SEP] Early on the following day, the storm re-curved northeastward and appeared to be heading out to sea. [CLS] [SEP] However, by August 17, it turned back to the northwest and made landfall near Hatteras, North Carolina early on the following day. [CLS] [SEP] No stronger hurricane has made landfall on the Outer Banks since the San Ciriaco hurricane. [CLS] [SEP] The storm weakened after moving inland and fell to Category 1 intensity by 1200 UTC on August 18. [CLS] [SEP] Later that day, the storm re-emerged into the Atlantic. [CLS] [SEP] Now heading northeastward, it continued weakening, but maintained Category 1 intensity. [CLS] [SEP] By late on August 20, the storm curved eastward over the northwestern Atlantic. [CLS] [SEP] It also began losing tropical characteristics and transitioned into an extratropical cyclone at 0000 UTC on August 22, while located about 325 miles (525 km) south of Sable Island. [CLS] [SEP] However, after four days, the system regenerated into a tropical storm while located about 695 miles (1,120 km) west-southwest of Flores Island in the Azores on August 26. [CLS] [SEP] It moved slowly north-northwestward, until curving to the east on August 29. [CLS] [SEP] Between August 26 and September 1, the storm did not differentiate in intensity, but began re-strengthening while turning southeastward on September 2. [CLS] [SEP] Early on the following day, the storm again reached hurricane intensity. [CLS] [SEP] It curved northeastward and passed through the Azores on September 3, shortly before transitioning into an extratropical cyclone. [CLS] [SEP] In Guadeloupe, the storm unroofed and flooded many houses. [CLS] [SEP] Communications were significantly disrupted in the interior portions of the island. [CLS] [SEP] Impact was severe in Montserrat, with nearly every building destroyed and 100 deaths reported. [CLS] [SEP] About 200 small houses were destroyed on Saint Kitts, with estates suffering considerable damage, while nearly all estates were destroyed on Saint Croix. [CLS] [SEP] Eleven deaths were reported on the island. [CLS] [SEP] In Puerto Rico, the system brought strong winds and heavy rainfall, which caused extensive flooding. [CLS] [SEP] Approximately 250,000 people were left without food and shelter. [CLS] [SEP] Additionally, telephone, telegraph, and electrical services were completely lost. [CLS] [SEP] Overall, damage totaled approximately $20 million, with over half were losses inflicted on crops, particularly coffee. [CLS] [SEP] At the time, it was the costliest and worst tropical cyclone in Puerto Rico. [CLS] [SEP] It was estimated that the storm caused 3,369 fatalities on the island territory. [CLS] [SEP] In the Bahamas, strong winds and waves sank 50 small crafts, most of them at Andros. [CLS] [SEP] Severe damage was reported in Nassau, with over 100 buildings destroyed and many damaged, including the Government House. [CLS] [SEP] A few houses were also destroyed on Bimini. [CLS] [SEP] The death toll in the Bahamas was at least 125. [CLS] [SEP] In North Carolina, storm surge and rough sea destroyed fishing piers and bridges, as well as sank about 10 vessels. [CLS] [SEP] Hatteras Island was almost entirely inundated with 4 to 10 feet (1.2 to 3.0 m) of water, and many homes were damaged. [CLS] [SEP] There was also much destruction at Diamond City, on the Shackleford Banks near Cape Lookout. [CLS] [SEP] There were at least 20 deaths in the state of North Carolina. [CLS] [SEP] In the Azores, the storm also caused one fatality and significant damage on some islands. [CLS] [SEP]
