Japan Airlines Flight 1628 was a claimed UFO incident that occurred on November 17, 1986 involving a Japanese Boeing 747-200F cargo aircraft. [CLS] [SEP] The aircraft was en route from Paris to Narita International Airport, near Tokyo, with a cargo of Beaujolais wine. [CLS] [SEP] On the Reykjav√≠k to Anchorage section of the flight, at 17:11 over eastern Alaska, the crew first witnessed two unidentified objects to their left. [CLS] [SEP] These abruptly rose from below and closed in to escort their aircraft. [CLS] [SEP] Each had two rectangular arrays of what appeared to be glowing nozzles or thrusters, though their bodies remained obscured by darkness. [CLS] [SEP] When closest, the aircraft's cabin was lit up and the captain could feel their heat on his face. [CLS] [SEP] These two craft departed before a third, much larger disk-shaped object started trailing them. [CLS] [SEP] Anchorage Air Traffic Control obliged and requested an oncoming United Airlines flight to confirm the unidentified traffic, but when it and a military craft sighted JAL 1628 at about 17:51, no other craft could be distinguished. [CLS] [SEP] The sighting lasted 50 minutes and ended in the vicinity of Mount Denali. [CLS] [SEP]
