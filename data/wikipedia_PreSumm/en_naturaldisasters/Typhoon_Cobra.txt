[CLS] Typhoon Cobra, also known as the Typhoon of 1944 or Halsey's Typhoon (named after Admiral William 'Bull' Halsey), was the United States Navy designation for a powerful tropical cyclone that struck the United States Pacific Fleet in December 1944, during World War II. [SEP] [CLS] Task Force 38 (TF 38) had been operating about 300 mi (260 nmi; 480 km) east of Luzon in the Philippine Sea, conducting air raids against Japanese airfields in the Philippines. [SEP] [CLS] The fleet was attempting to refuel its ships, in particular the lighter destroyers, which had small fuel tanks. [SEP] [CLS] As the weather worsened, refueling became increasingly difficult, and the attempts had to be discontinued. [SEP] [CLS] Despite warning signs of worsening conditions, the ships remained on station. [SEP] [CLS] Worse, the information given to Halsey about the location and direction of the typhoon was inaccurate. [SEP] [CLS] On December 17, Halsey unwittingly sailed the Third Fleet into the center of the typhoon. [SEP] [CLS] Because of 100 mph (87 kn; 45 m/s; 160 km/h) winds, high seas, and torrential rain, three destroyers capsized and sank, with 790 lives lost. [SEP] [CLS] Nine other warships were damaged, and over 100 aircraft were wrecked or washed overboard. [SEP] [CLS] The aircraft carrier Monterey was forced to battle a serious fire that was caused by a plane hitting a bulkhead. [SEP] [CLS] Planes went adrift, collided, and burst into flames. [SEP] [CLS] Monterey caught fire at 0911 (18 December) and lost steerageway a few minutes later. [SEP] [CLS] The fire, miraculously, was brought under control at 0945, and the C.O., Captain Stuart H. [SEP] [CLS] Ingersoll, wisely decided to let his ship lie dead in the water until temporary repairs could be effected. [SEP] [CLS] She lost 18 aircraft burned in the hangar deck or blown overboard and 16 seriously damaged, together with three 20-mm guns, and suffered extensive rupturing of her ventilation system. [SEP] [CLS] Cowpens lost 7 planes overboard and caught fire from one that broke loose at 1051, but the fire was brought under control promptly; Langley rolled through 70 degrees; San Jacinto reported a fighter plane adrift on the hangar deck which wrecked seven other aircraft. [SEP] [CLS] She also suffered damage from salt water that entered through punctures in the ventilating ducts. [SEP] [CLS] Captain [Jasper T.] Acuff's replenishment escort carriers did pretty well. [SEP] [CLS] Flames broke out on the flight deck of Cape Esperance at 1228 but were overcome; Kwajalein made a maximum roll of 39 degrees to port when hove-to with wind abeam. [SEP] [CLS] Her port catwalks scooped up green water, but she lost only three planes which were jettisoned from the flight deck; it took one hour to get them over the side. [SEP] [CLS] Three other escort carriers lost in all 86 aircraft but came through without much material damage." USS Tabberer – a small John C. [SEP] [CLS] Butler-class destroyer escort – lost her mast and radio antennas. [SEP] [CLS] Though damaged and unable to radio for help, the ship remained on the scene and recovered 55 of the 93 total sailors who were rescued from capsized ships. [SEP] [CLS] Captain Henry Lee Plage earned the Legion of Merit, while the entire crew earned the Navy Unit Commendation Ribbon, which was presented to them by Halsey. [SEP] [CLS] In the words of Admiral Chester Nimitz, the typhoon's impact "...represented a more crippling blow to the Third Fleet than it might be expected to suffer in anything less than a major action." The events surrounding Typhoon Cobra were similar to those the Japanese navy itself faced some nine years earlier in what they termed the "Fourth Fleet Incident". [SEP] [CLS] This typhoon led to the establishment of weather infrastructure of the U.S. [SEP] [CLS] Navy, which eventually became the Joint Typhoon Warning Center. [SEP] [CLS]
