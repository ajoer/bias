Tropical Storm Rolf, also known as Tropical Storm 01M and Invest 99L, was an unusual Mediterranean tropical storm that brought flooding to Italy, France, and Switzerland in November 2011, killing 12 people. [CLS] [SEP] Rolf originated from an extratropical system near western France on November 4. [CLS] [SEP] Despite the unfavorable conditions in the Mediterranean Sea, Rolf transitioned into a subtropical depression on November 7, before becoming a fully tropical storm later that day. [CLS] [SEP] On November 8, Rolf reached its peak intensity, with 1-minute sustained winds peaking at 80 km/h (50 mph; 43 kn), and a minimum pressure of 991 mb (29.3 inHg). [CLS] [SEP] During the next day, the storm made landfall on the island of Île du Levant, France, and soon afterwards, near Hyères in Southeastern France. [CLS] [SEP] Rolf quickly weakened and dissipated on November 10, following its second landfall. [CLS] [SEP] Rolf was the first tropical cyclone ever to be officially monitored by the NOAA in the Mediterranean Sea. [CLS] [SEP] Rolf was also the costliest Mediterranean tropical-like cyclone in the 2010s, with the storm causing at least $1.25 billion (2011 USD) in damages. [CLS] [SEP]
