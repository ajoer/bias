[CLS] Pan Am Flight 103 was a regularly scheduled Pan Am transatlantic flight from Frankfurt to Detroit via London and New York City. [SEP] [CLS] On 21 December 1988, N739PA, the aircraft operating the transatlantic leg of the route was destroyed by a bomb, killing all 243 passengers and 16 crew in what became known as the Lockerbie bombing. [SEP] [CLS] Large sections of the aircraft crashed onto a residential street in Lockerbie, Scotland, killing 11 people on the ground. [SEP] [CLS] With a total of 270 people killed, it is the deadliest terrorist attack in the history of the United Kingdom. [SEP] [CLS] Following a three-year joint investigation by Dumfries and Galloway Constabulary and the US Federal Bureau of Investigation (FBI), arrest warrants were issued for two Libyan nationals in November 1991. [SEP] [CLS] In 1999, Libyan leader Muammar Gaddafi handed over the two men for trial at Camp Zeist, Netherlands, after protracted negotiations and UN sanctions. [SEP] [CLS] In 2001, Abdelbaset al-Megrahi, a Libyan intelligence officer, was jailed for life after being found guilty of 270 counts of murder in connection with the bombing. [SEP] [CLS] In August 2009, he was released by the Scottish Government on compassionate grounds after being diagnosed with prostate cancer. [SEP] [CLS] He died in May 2012 as the only person to be convicted for the attack. [SEP] [CLS] In 2003, Gaddafi accepted responsibility for the Lockerbie bombing and paid compensation to the families of the victims, although he maintained that he had never given the order for the attack. [SEP] [CLS] Acceptance of responsibility was part of a series of requirements laid out by a UN resolution in order for sanctions against Libya to be lifted. [SEP] [CLS] Libya said it had to accept responsibility due to Megrahi's status as a government employee.During the Libyan Civil War in 2011, former Minister of Justice Mustafa Abdul Jalil claimed that the Libyan leader had personally ordered the bombing, though this was later denied, while investigators have long believed that Megrahi did not act alone, and have been reported as questioning retired Stasi agents about a possible role in the attack. [SEP] [CLS] Some relatives of the dead, including the Lockerbie campaigner Dr Jim Swire, believe the bomb was planted at Heathrow Airport and not sent via feeder flights from Malta, as the US and UK claim. [SEP] [CLS] A cell belonging to the Popular Front for the Liberation of Palestine (General Command) had been operating in West Germany in the months before the Pan Am bombing. [SEP] [CLS]
