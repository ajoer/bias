[CLS] Thomas Jefferson (April 13, 1743 â€“ July 4, 1826) was an American statesman, diplomat, lawyer, architect, philosopher, and Founding Father who served as the third president of the United States from 1801 to 1809. [SEP] [CLS] He had previously served as the second vice president of the United States between 1797 and 1801. [SEP] [CLS] The principal author of the Declaration of Independence, Jefferson was a proponent of democracy, republicanism, and individual rights, motivating American colonists to break from the Kingdom of Great Britain and form a new nation; he produced formative documents and decisions at both the state and national level. [SEP] [CLS] During the American Revolution, Jefferson represented Virginia in the Continental Congress that adopted the Declaration, drafted the law for religious freedom as a Virginia legislator, and served as the second Governor of Virginia from 1779 to 1781, during the American Revolutionary War. [SEP] [CLS] In May 1785, Jefferson was appointed the United States Minister to France, and subsequently, the nation's first secretary of state under President George Washington from 1790 to 1793. [SEP] [CLS] Jefferson and James Madison organized the Democratic-Republican Party to oppose the Federalist Party during the formation of the First Party System. [SEP] [CLS] With Madison, he anonymously wrote the provocative Kentucky and Virginia Resolutions in 1798 and 1799, which sought to strengthen states' rights by nullifying the federal Alien and Sedition Acts. [SEP] [CLS] As president, Jefferson pursued the nation's shipping and trade interests against Barbary pirates and aggressive British trade policies. [SEP] [CLS] Starting in 1803, Jefferson promoted a western expansionist policy, organizing the Louisiana Purchase, doubling the nation's land area. [SEP] [CLS] To make room for settlement, Jefferson began a controversial process of Indian tribal removal from the newly acquired territory. [SEP] [CLS] As a result of peace negotiations with France, his administration reduced military forces. [SEP] [CLS] Jefferson was reelected in 1804. [SEP] [CLS] His second term was beset with difficulties at home, including the trial of former vice president Aaron Burr. [SEP] [CLS] In 1807, American foreign trade was diminished when Jefferson implemented the Embargo Act in response to British threats to U.S. [SEP] [CLS] shipping. [SEP] [CLS] The same year, Jefferson signed the Act Prohibiting Importation of Slaves. [SEP] [CLS] Jefferson, while primarily a planter, lawyer and politician, mastered many disciplines, which ranged from surveying and mathematics to horticulture and mechanics. [SEP] [CLS] He was an architect in the classical tradition. [SEP] [CLS] Jefferson's keen interest in religion and philosophy led to his presidency of the American Philosophical Society; he shunned organized religion but was influenced by both Christianity and deism. [SEP] [CLS] A philologist, Jefferson knew several languages. [SEP] [CLS] He was a prolific letter writer and corresponded with many prominent people. [SEP] [CLS] His only full-length book is Notes on the State of Virginia (1785), considered perhaps the most important American book published before 1800. [SEP] [CLS] Jefferson championed the ideals, values, and teachings of the Enlightenment. [SEP] [CLS] During his lifetime Jefferson owned over 600 slaves. [SEP] [CLS] As a wealthy landholder, he used slaves in his household and on his plantations. [SEP] [CLS] Although the matter remains a subject of debate, most historians believe that Jefferson had a sexual relationship with his slave Sally Hemings, a mixed-race woman who was a half-sister to his late wife and that he fathered at least one of her children. [SEP] [CLS] After retiring from public office, Jefferson founded the University of Virginia. [SEP] [CLS] Along with Millard Fillmore who founded the University at Buffalo, he is one of only two U.S. [SEP] [CLS] presidents to found a university. [SEP] [CLS] Jefferson died on Independence Day, July 4, 1826. [SEP] [CLS] Presidential scholars and historians generally praise Jefferson's public achievements, including his advocacy of religious freedom and tolerance in Virginia. [SEP] [CLS] Although some modern scholars have been critical of Jefferson and slavery, Jefferson continues to rank highly, among the top ten U.S. [SEP] [CLS] presidents. [SEP] [CLS]
