The 1909 Velasco hurricane was an intense tropical cyclone that devastated areas of the Texas coast in July of the 1909 Atlantic hurricane season. [CLS] [SEP] The fourth tropical storm, second hurricane, and first major hurricane of the season, it formed from an area of disturbed weather east of the Leeward Islands on July 13, 1909. [CLS] [SEP] Remaining weak for much of its early existence, the system began to intensify after nearing Jamaica. [CLS] [SEP] Curving towards the northwest, it reached hurricane strength on July 18 near the western tip of Cuba. [CLS] [SEP] Intensification stalled as it moved westwards across the Gulf of Mexico, but resumed as the hurricane approached the Texas coast. [CLS] [SEP] The storm intensified to a major hurricane on July 21 and subsequently reached its peak intensity with winds of 115 mph (185 km/h) prior to making landfall near Velasco, Texas. [CLS] [SEP] Once over land, the system began to quickly weaken, and dissipated near the Rio Grande on July 22. [CLS] [SEP] The hurricane caused 41 deaths and $2 million in damages, all of which were in Texas. [CLS] [SEP] Strong waves caused several offshore shipping incidents, and storm surge inundated areas of the Texas coast, though damage in Galveston was mostly mitigated by the Galveston Seawall. [CLS] [SEP] In Velasco, only eight buildings remained intact after the hurricane. [CLS] [SEP] Strong winds forced train closures and destroyed and downed various infrastructure.
