The 2010 New Year's Eve tornado outbreak was a three-day-long tornado outbreak that impacted the central and lower Mississippi Valley from December 30, 2010 to January 1, 2011. [CLS] [SEP] Associated with a low pressure system and a strong cold front, 37 tornadoes tracked across five states over the length of the severe event, killing nine and injuring several others. [CLS] [SEP] Activity was centered in the states of Missouri and later Mississippi on December 31. [CLS] [SEP] Seven tornadoes were rated EF3 on the Enhanced Fujita Scale; these were the strongest during the outbreak. [CLS] [SEP] Non-tornadic winds were recorded to have reached as high as 80 mph (130 km/h) at eight locations on December 31, while hail as large as 2.75 in (7.0 cm) was documented north-northeast of Mansfield, Missouri. [CLS] [SEP] Overall, damage from the outbreak totaled US$123.3 million, most of which was related to tornadoes.The United States Storm Prediction Center first noted a possible New Year's Eve severe weather event as early as December 25, 2010. [CLS] [SEP] These forecasts gained confidence as the event approached, with a focus on the Ozarks and adjacent areas. [CLS] [SEP] Supercells developed in this area during the night of December 30 and tracked across central Missouri, producing several tornadoes and large hail. [CLS] [SEP] However, the bulk of activity during the outbreak was a result of a long line of supercells that tracked from Oklahoma to Illinois, producing five EF3 tornadoes. [CLS] [SEP] One of these tracked through northwestern Arkansas, killing four. [CLS] [SEP] Another tore through eastern sections of Fort Leonard Wood in Missouri, destroying 159 homes and causing US$90 million in damage, making it the costliest tornado of the outbreak. [CLS] [SEP] A separate cluster of storms later developed in Louisiana before tracking into Mississippi, producing several tornadoes across southern and central regions of the state on January 1.
