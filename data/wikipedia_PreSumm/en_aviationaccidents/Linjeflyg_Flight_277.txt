[CLS] Linjeflyg Flight 267 was a controlled flight into terrain by a Convair 440-75 Metropolitan on 20 November 1964 at 21:14 in Ängelholm, Skåne, Sweden. [SEP] [CLS] The Linjeflyg pilots, misled by a non-conventional military runway light configuration, descended too early and on a faulty course during approach to Ängelholm–Helsingborg Airport. [SEP] [CLS] The crash killed 31 of 43 people on board, making it the deadliest aviation accident in Sweden. [SEP] [CLS] The flight was en route from Stockholm to Ängelholm, but bad weather caused it to skip stopovers at Hultsfred and Halmstad. [SEP] [CLS] There was less than 2.0 kilometers (1.2 mi) visibility and a low cloud base at Ängelholm, so air traffic control lit its approach lighting system. [SEP] [CLS] As the civilian sector at Swedish Air Force base F 10 Ängelholm, the airport had a military configuration and did not follow normal civilian configuration. [SEP] [CLS] This caused a pilot error in the navigation and the aircraft landed 2.0 kilometers (1.2 mi) before the runway threshold. [SEP] [CLS] The aircraft inverted while sliding after impact. [SEP] [CLS] Despite the death toll, three people walked uninjured from the crash. [SEP] [CLS] The investigation commission found no fault of the pilot or air traffic control, instead focusing on short-cuts being taken by the Swedish Air Force and the Civil Aviation Administration (CAA) to not configure military airports in line with civilian regulations. [SEP] [CLS] The finding caused a surge of funding which subsequently caused military airports to change their instrument landing system and approach lighting system to meet civilian requirements.
