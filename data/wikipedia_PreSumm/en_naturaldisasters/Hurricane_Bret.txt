[CLS] Hurricane Bret was the first of five Category 4 hurricanes that developed during the 1999 Atlantic hurricane season and the first tropical cyclone since Hurricane Jerry in 1989 to make landfall in Texas at hurricane intensity. [SEP] [CLS] Forming from a tropical wave on August 18, Bret slowly organized within weak steering currents in the Bay of Campeche. [SEP] [CLS] By August 20, the storm began to track northward and underwent rapid intensification on August 21. [SEP] [CLS] After this period of strengthening, Bret attained its peak intensity with winds of 145 miles per hour (233 km/h) and a barometric pressure of 944 mbar (hPa; 27.9 inHg). [SEP] [CLS] Later that day, the storm weakened to a Category 3 hurricane and made landfall on Padre Island, Texas. [SEP] [CLS] Shortly thereafter, the storm weakened further, becoming a tropical depression 24 hours after moving inland. [SEP] [CLS] The remnants of the storm eventually dissipated early on August 26 over northern Mexico. [SEP] [CLS] Along the Texas coastline, Bret threatened several cities, prompting 180,000 residents to evacuate. [SEP] [CLS] Numerous shelters were opened throughout the region and prisons were evacuated. [SEP] [CLS] Several days prior to the storm's arrival, the NHC issued hurricane watches, and later warnings for areas near the Texasâ€“Mexico border. [SEP] [CLS] Several major roads leading to barrier island towns were shut down to prevent residents from crossing bridges during the hurricane. [SEP] [CLS] In nearby Mexico, roughly 7,000 people left coastal areas in advance of the storm. [SEP] [CLS] Officials also set up hundreds of shelters in northern regions of the country in case of major flooding. [SEP] [CLS] Bret made landfall in a sparsely populated region, resulting in relatively little damage in comparison to its intensity. [SEP] [CLS] Nevertheless, seven people were killed in relation to the storm, four in Texas and three in Mexico. [SEP] [CLS] Most of the deaths were due to car accidents caused by slippery roads. [SEP] [CLS] Upon making landfall, the hurricane produced a maximum storm surge of 8.8 ft (2.7 m) at Matagorda Island, Texas. [SEP] [CLS] Heavy rains produced by Bret peaked at 13.18 in (335 mm) in Texas and were estimated over 14 in (360 mm) in Mexico. [SEP] [CLS] Numerous homes in the affected regions were damaged or destroyed, leaving roughly 150 people homeless. [SEP] [CLS] In all, the storm caused $15 million (1999 USD) in damage. [SEP] [CLS]
