[CLS] Subtropical Storm Andrea was the first named storm and the first subtropical cyclone of the 2007 Atlantic hurricane season. [SEP] [CLS] Andrea developed out of a non-tropical low on May 9 about 150 miles (240 km) northeast of Daytona Beach, Florida, three weeks before the official start of the season. [SEP] [CLS] After encountering dry air and strong vertical wind shear, Andrea weakened to a subtropical depression on May 10 while remaining nearly stationary, and the National Hurricane Center discontinued advisories early on May 11. [SEP] [CLS] Andrea's remnant was subsequently absorbed into another extratropical storm on May 14. [SEP] [CLS] Andrea was the first pre-season storm to develop since Tropical Storm Ana in April 2003. [SEP] [CLS] Additionally, the storm was the first Atlantic named storm in May since Tropical Storm Arlene in 1981.The storm produced rough surf along the coastline from Florida to North Carolina, causing beach erosion and some damage. [SEP] [CLS] In some areas, the waves eroded up to 20 feet (6 m) of beach, leaving 70 homes in danger of collapse. [SEP] [CLS] Offshore North Carolina, high waves of 34 feet (10 m) and tropical-storm-force winds damaged three boats; their combined nine passengers were rescued by the Coast Guard, although all nine sustained injuries. [SEP] [CLS] Light rainfall was also reported in some coastal locations. [SEP] [CLS] Damage was minimal, but six people drowned as a result of the storm. [SEP] [CLS]
