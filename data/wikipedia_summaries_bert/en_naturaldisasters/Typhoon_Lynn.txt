Typhoon Lynn, more commonly known in the Philippines as Typhoon Pepang, was responsible for the worst flooding in Taiwan in 40 years. [CLS] [SEP] Typhoon Lynn originated from an area of disturbed weather in the central north Pacific in mid-October 1987. [CLS] [SEP] On October 15, the system was upgraded into a tropical storm. [CLS] [SEP] Moving west-northwest, it slowly deepened over the next few days, though the intensification process briefly stopped on October 15. [CLS] [SEP] Two days later, Lynn was upgraded into a typhoon, while passing northwest of Guam. [CLS] [SEP] Lynn maintained low-end typhoon strength until October 19, when the storm began to rapidly intensify. [CLS] [SEP] On October 21, Lynn attained its peak intensity while tracking towards the west. [CLS] [SEP] Weakening then commenced soon after Lynn interacted with Luzon. [CLS] [SEP] However, the core of the typhoon remained well offshore both the Philippines and Taiwan. [CLS] [SEP] On October 25, Lynn weakened to a severe tropical storm. [CLS] [SEP] Three days later, it dissipated, though its remains later brought rain to China. [CLS] [SEP] While passing near Guam, power was knocked out and 40 residents were evacuated. [CLS] [SEP] Throughout the Mariana Islands, 15 families were rendered homeless and damage totaled $2 million (1987 USD). [CLS] [SEP] After brushing Luzon, seven people perished, over 30,000 homes were damaged, 100 houses were destroyed, and 7,000 individuals were left homeless. [CLS] [SEP] Damage in the Philippines totaled to $25.3 million. [CLS] [SEP] Even though Lynn passed a bit south of Taiwan, the storm brought widespread damage to the nation. [CLS] [SEP] Nine children were swept away and killed on a field trip, while another 72 survived and were evacuated. [CLS] [SEP] In Taipei, 13 persons perished and 2,230 people were rescued. [CLS] [SEP] Lynn was considered the worst tropical cyclone to affect the city in four decades. [CLS] [SEP] Nationwide, 168,000 people lost power and 42 casualties occurred. [CLS] [SEP]
