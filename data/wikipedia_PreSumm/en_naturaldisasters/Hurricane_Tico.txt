[CLS] Hurricane Tico is one of four major hurricanes to strike Mazatlan. [SEP] [CLS] The origins of Hurricane Tico were from a weak tropical disturbance that crossed Costa Rica into the Pacific Ocean on October 7, 1983. [SEP] [CLS] Over warm waters, the system was sufficiently organized to be declared Tropical Depression Twenty-One on October 11, about 575 mi (930 km) south of Acapulco. [SEP] [CLS] On October 12 it turned sharply northward; the depression was upgraded to Tropical Storm Tico on October 13. [SEP] [CLS] Tropical Storm Tico continued to intensify. [SEP] [CLS] Two days after becoming a tropical storm, Tico strengthened further to attain hurricane status. [SEP] [CLS] Early on October 19, it reached peak winds of 130 mph (215 km/h). [SEP] [CLS] It weakened slightly as it approached the coast, and at about 1500 UTC that day Tico made landfall near Mazatlán with winds of 125 mph (205 km/h). [SEP] [CLS] The remains were tracked into the Mid-Atlantic States for five more days. [SEP] [CLS] Tico was the deadliest and most destructive tropical cyclone of the season. [SEP] [CLS] Overall, the hurricane sank nine small ships, and nine fishermen were killed. [SEP] [CLS] Hurricane Tico was responsible severe flooding and heavy damage due to strong winds. [SEP] [CLS] Throughout the state of Sinaloa, the hurricane destroyed nearly 19,000 acres (77 km²) of bean and corn, although most of the agricultural damage occurred south of Mazatlán. [SEP] [CLS] In addition, the hurricane disrupted the flow of drinking water. [SEP] [CLS] A total of 13 hotels received extensive damage and 14 people were hurt. [SEP] [CLS] Twenty-five thousand people were homeless and damage throughout the country was estimated at $200 million (1983 USD). [SEP] [CLS] Hurricane Tico caused a total of 135 deaths in Mexico. [SEP] [CLS] Although most of its impact occurred in Mexico, Tico's remnants moved into the United States, where they caused heavy rains and flooding. [SEP] [CLS] A total of 141 people were killed and the damage amounted to $284 million (1983 USD). [SEP] [CLS]
