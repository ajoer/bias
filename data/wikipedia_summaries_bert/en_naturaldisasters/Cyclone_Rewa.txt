[CLS] Severe Tropical Cyclone Rewa affected six countries and caused 22 deaths on its 28-day journey across the South Pacific Ocean in December 1993 and January 1994. [SEP] [CLS] Cyclone Rewa developed from a tropical disturbance on 28 December south of Nauru. [SEP] [CLS] After forming, Rewa moved southwest through the Solomon Islands, crossing the 160th meridian east from the South Pacific basin into the Australian region. [SEP] [CLS] The cyclone began to strengthen steadily and turned southward, paralleling the eastern Australian coast through 31 December. [SEP] [CLS] Rewa reached its initial peak intensity as a Category 4 tropical cyclone on 2 January. [SEP] [CLS] It maintained this intensity for about 12 hours before an increase in wind shear induced its weakening by 3 January. [SEP] [CLS] The cyclone turned southeastward and moved back into the South Pacific basin on 4 January, before it passed over New Caledonia between 5â€“6 January. [SEP] [CLS] After affecting New Caledonia, Rewa weakened to a tropical depression and turned northwestward before re-entering the Australian basin on 10 January. [SEP] [CLS] Over the following days, the cyclone showed signs of restrengthening and executed an elongated cyclonic loop to the southeast of Papua New Guinea. [SEP] [CLS] Rewa subsequently entered a phase of quick intensification while proceeding southeastward, peaking in intensity as a Category 5 severe tropical cyclone. [SEP] [CLS] It recurved toward the southwest while gradually weakening for several days. [SEP] [CLS] Although forecasters had predicted Rewa to make landfall near Mackay, Queensland, the cyclone began interacting with an upper-level trough on 18 January, causing it to divert to the southeast and move along the Queensland coast. [SEP] [CLS] Rewa transitioned into an extratropical cyclone on 20 January, with its remnants bringing heavy rain to New Zealand three days later. [SEP] [CLS] The cyclone caused the deaths of 22 people on its course, affecting parts of the Solomon Islands, Papua New Guinea, Eastern Australia, New Caledonia, Vanuatu and New Zealand. [SEP] [CLS] Nine people in a banana dinghy en route to Rossel Island went missing at the height of the storm; they were presumed drowned after wreckage from their boat turned up at the island. [SEP] [CLS] In Queensland, three people died in traffic accidents caused by the storm, and another fatality occurred when a boy became trapped in a storm pipe. [SEP] [CLS] One death took place in New Caledonia, while flooding caused eight drownings in Papua New Guinea. [SEP] [CLS] After this usage of the name Rewa, the name was retired. [SEP] [CLS]
