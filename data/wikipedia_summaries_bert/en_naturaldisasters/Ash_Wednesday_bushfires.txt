[CLS] The Ash Wednesday bushfires, known in South Australia as Ash Wednesday II, were a series of bushfires that occurred in south-eastern Australia on 16 February 1983, which was Ash Wednesday. [SEP] [CLS] Within twelve hours, more than 180 fires fanned by winds of up to 110 km/h (68 mph) caused widespread destruction across the states of Victoria and South Australia. [SEP] [CLS] Years of severe drought and extreme weather combined to create one of Australia's worst fire days in a century. [SEP] [CLS] The fires became the deadliest bushfire in Australian history until the Black Saturday bushfires in 2009. [SEP] [CLS] In Victoria, 47 people died. [SEP] [CLS] There were 28 deaths in South Australia. [SEP] [CLS] This included 14 CFA and 3 CFS volunteer fire-fighters who died across both states that day. [SEP] [CLS] Many fatalities were as a result of firestorm conditions caused by a sudden and violent wind change in the evening which rapidly changed the direction and size of the fire front. [SEP] [CLS] The speed and ferocity of the flames, aided by abundant fuels and a landscape immersed in smoke, made fire suppression and containment impossible. [SEP] [CLS] In many cases, residents fended for themselves as fires broke communications, cut off escape routes and severed electricity and water supplies. [SEP] [CLS] Up to 8,000 people were evacuated in Victoria at the height of the crisis and a state of disaster was declared for the first time in South Australia's history. [SEP] [CLS] More than 35 townhouses were burned in a small town in Victoria. [SEP] [CLS] Ash Wednesday was one of Australia's costliest natural disasters. [SEP] [CLS] More than 3,700 buildings were destroyed or damaged and 2,545 individuals and families lost their homes. [SEP] [CLS] Livestock losses were very high, with more than 340,000 sheep, 18,000 cattle and numerous native animals either dead or later destroyed. [SEP] [CLS] A total of 4,540 insurance claims were paid totalling A$176 million with a total estimated cost of well over $400 million (1983 values) for both states or $1.3 billion in adjusted terms (2007).The emergency saw the largest number of volunteers called to duty from across Australia at the same timeâ€”an estimated 130,000 firefighters, defence force personnel, relief workers and support crews.
