Örüg Temür (Chinese: 兀雷帖木兒汗) or Gulichi (Chinese: 鬼力赤) (1379 - 1408) was a Mongol leader who temporarily enthroned himself Khan of the Northern Yuan dynasty based in Mongolia in the early 15th century. [CLS] [SEP] He might also have been known as Ugechi Khashikha (Chinese: 烏格齊哈什哈). [CLS] [SEP] "Khashikha" means prince or duke in the Tungusic languages. [CLS] [SEP] He was a leader of the Oirats, particularly the Torguud clan. [CLS] [SEP] Örüg Temür may have been descended from either Ariq Böke or Genghis Khan's younger brothers, either Hasar or Temüge. [CLS] [SEP] He may also have been a descendant of Ogedai. [CLS] [SEP] Thus, it is still unclear whether he was an Oirat or Genghisid. [CLS] [SEP] Elbeg Khan (1400–1402) appointed Bahamu (Batlai, Mahamu, Muhamud) ruler of the Four Oirats after he had mistakenly executed his father Taifu. [CLS] [SEP] The Khagan's decision disappointed the Oirat leader Gulichi (or Örüg Temür?). [CLS] [SEP] Gulichi and Bahamu organized the plot to kill Elbeg and succeeded; the former seized the family and property of the late Khagan. [CLS] [SEP] Gulichi became the new Khan in 1402, and abolished the name Yuan Dynasty. [CLS] [SEP]
