[CLS] Tropical Storm Danielle was a strong tropical storm that made landfall on Virginia in the 1992 Atlantic hurricane season. [SEP] [CLS] The fourth storm of the season, Danielle was one of two tropical cyclones in the year to make landfall in the United States, the other being Hurricane Andrew. [SEP] [CLS] It formed out of a stationary trough of low pressure on September 18 near the coast of North Carolina. [SEP] [CLS] The system quickly reached tropical storm status, and Danielle looped to the west due to a change in steering currents. [SEP] [CLS] Tropical Storm Danielle reached a peak of 65 mph (105 km/h) winds before weakening and hitting the Delmarva Peninsula. [SEP] [CLS] The storm quickly dissipated over land. [SEP] [CLS] The storm dropped light rainfall throughout its path, and winds were minimal.
