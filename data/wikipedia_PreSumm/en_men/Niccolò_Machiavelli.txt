[CLS] Niccolò di Bernardo dei Machiavelli (, also US: ; Italian: [nikkoˈlɔ mmakjaˈvɛlli]; 3 May 1469 – 21 June 1527) was an Italian Renaissance diplomat, philosopher and writer, best known for The Prince (Il Principe), written in 1513. [SEP] [CLS] He has often been called the father of modern political philosophy or political science.For many years he served as a senior official in the Florentine Republic with responsibilities in diplomatic and military affairs. [SEP] [CLS] He wrote comedies, carnival songs, and poetry. [SEP] [CLS] His personal correspondence is of high importance to historians and scholars. [SEP] [CLS] He worked as secretary to the Second Chancery of the Republic of Florence from 1498 to 1512, when the Medici were out of power. [SEP] [CLS] Machiavelli's name came to evoke unscrupulous politicians of the sort Machiavelli advised most famously in The Prince. [SEP] [CLS] Machiavelli considered political battles, not through a lens of morality, but as though they are a board game with established rules. [SEP] [CLS] His experience showed him that politics have always been played with deception, treachery and crime. [SEP] [CLS] He also notably said that a ruler who is establishing a kingdom or a republic, and is criticized for his deeds, including violence, should be excused when the intention and the result is beneficial. [SEP] [CLS] Machiavelli’s Prince was much read as a manuscript long before it was published in 1532 and the reaction was mixed. [SEP] [CLS] Some considered it a straightforward description of "the evil means used by bad rulers; others read in it evil recommendations to tyrants to help them maintain their power."The term Machiavellian often connotes political deceit, deviousness, and realpolitik. [SEP] [CLS] Even though Machiavelli has become most famous for his work on principalities, scholars also give attention to the exhortations in his other works of political philosophy. [SEP] [CLS] While much less well known than The Prince, the Discourses on Livy (composed c. [SEP] [CLS] 1517) is often said to have paved the way of modern republicanism. [SEP] [CLS]
