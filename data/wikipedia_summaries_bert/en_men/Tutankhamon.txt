Tutankhamun (, Ancient Egyptian: twt-ꜥnḫ-jmn), Egyptological pronunciation Tutankhamen (British ) (c. [CLS] [SEP] 1342 – c. [CLS] [SEP] 1325 BC), was an ancient Egyptian pharaoh who was the last of his royal family to rule during the end of the 18th dynasty (ruled c. [CLS] [SEP] 1334 – 1325 BC in the conventional chronology) during the New Kingdom of Egyptian history. [CLS] [SEP] His father was the pharaoh Akhenaten, believed to be the mummy found in the tomb KV55. [CLS] [SEP] His mother is his father's sister, identified through DNA testing as an unknown mummy referred to as "The Younger Lady" who was found in KV35.Tutankhamun took the throne at eight or nine years of age under the unprecedented viziership of his eventual successor, Ay, to whom he may have been related. [CLS] [SEP] He married his half sister Ankhesenamun. [CLS] [SEP] During their marriage they lost two daughters, one at 5–6 months of pregnancy and the other shortly after birth at full-term. [CLS] [SEP] His names—Tutankhaten and Tutankhamun—are thought to mean "Living image of Aten" and "Living image of Amun", with Aten replaced by Amun after Akhenaten's death. [CLS] [SEP] Some Egyptologists believe the translation may be closer to "The-life-of-Aten-is-pleasing" or "One-perfect-of-life-is-Aten". [CLS] [SEP] Tutankhamun restored the Ancient Egyptian religion after its dissolution by his father, enriched and endowed the priestly orders of two important cults and began restoring old monuments damaged during the previous Amarna period. [CLS] [SEP] He moved his father's remains to the Valley of the Kings as well as moving the capitol from Akhetaten to Thebes. [CLS] [SEP] Tutankhamun was physically disabled with a deformity of his left foot along with bone necrosis that required the use of a cane, several of which were found in his tomb as well as body armor and bows—he had been trained in archery. [CLS] [SEP] He had other health issues including scoliosis and had contracted several strains of malaria. [CLS] [SEP] The 1922 discovery by Howard Carter of Tutankhamun's nearly intact tomb, in excavations funded by Lord Carnarvon, received worldwide press coverage. [CLS] [SEP] With over 5,000 artifacts, it sparked a renewed public interest in ancient Egypt, for which Tutankhamun's mask, now in the Egyptian Museum, remains a popular symbol. [CLS] [SEP] The deaths of a few involved in the discovery of Tutankhamun's mummy have been popularly attributed to the curse of the pharaohs. [CLS] [SEP] He has, since the discovery of his intact tomb, been referred to colloquially as "King Tut". [CLS] [SEP] Some of his treasure has traveled worldwide with unprecedented response. [CLS] [SEP] The Egyptian Supreme Council of Antiquities allowed tours beginning in 1962 with the exhibit at the Louvre in Paris, followed by the Kyoto Municipal Museum of Art in Tokyo, Japan. [CLS] [SEP] The exhibits drew in millions of visitors. [CLS] [SEP] The 1972–1979 exhibit was shown in United States, Soviet Union, Japan, France, Canada, and West Germany. [CLS] [SEP] There were no international exhibitions again until 2005–2011. [CLS] [SEP] This exhibit featured Tutankhamun's predecessors from the 18th dynasty, including Hatshepsut and Akhenaten, but did not include the golden death mask. [CLS] [SEP] The treasures 2019–2022 tour began in Los Angeles and will end in 2022 at the new Grand Egyptian Museum in Cairo, which, for the first time, will be displaying the full Tutankhamun collection, gathered from all of Egypt's museums and storerooms.
