Typhoon Sanba, known in the Philippines as Typhoon Karen, was the strongest tropical cyclone worldwide in 2012. [CLS] [SEP] The sixteenth named storm and tenth typhoon of the annual typhoon season, Sanba formed as a tropical depression east of The Philippines on September 10. [CLS] [SEP] The storm gradually intensified as it moved generally northward in an area favorable for tropical development. [CLS] [SEP] The system was soon upgraded to a tropical storm less than a day after formation and subsequently further to a typhoon on September 12. [CLS] [SEP] Later that day, Sanba entered a phase of explosive intensification, quickly strengthening and gaining annular characteristics. [CLS] [SEP] On September 13, the system attained its peak intensity with maximum sustained winds of 125 mph (205 km/h), and a barometric pressure of 900 mbar (hPa; 26.58 inHg), becoming the strongest typhoon in the Western Pacific Ocean since Megi in 2010. [CLS] [SEP] Accelerating towards more northerly latitudes, a period of gradual weakening ensued afterwards as its eye expanded. [CLS] [SEP] It made landfall on South Korea late on September 17 as a typhoon before transitioning into an extratropical cyclone the following day. [CLS] [SEP] Sanba's remnants tracked into the Primorsky Krai region of eastern Russia before they were last noted on September 19. [CLS] [SEP] Passing just to the west of Japan, Sanba caused extensive losses to agriculture, forestry, and fishing industries on the islands of Okinawa Prefecture. [CLS] [SEP] Further inland on Kōchi and Gifu Prefectures, heavy rains damaged agricultural regions and washed out numerous roads. [CLS] [SEP] Losses on both prefectures totalled to ¥1.55 billion (US$1.98 million). [CLS] [SEP] Upon its landfall on the Korean Peninsula on September 17, it became the first time in 50 years that the peninsula had been struck by at least four typhoons in a single year. [CLS] [SEP] In South Korea, torrential rainfall also washed out road systems and inundated crop land, as well as damaged infrastructure. [CLS] [SEP] Losses there associated with Sanba totaled to ₩389 billion (US$347.5 million). [CLS] [SEP] In North Korea, the heavy precipitation worsened preexisting flood conditions initially started by Tropical Storm Khanun two months prior. [CLS] [SEP] Overall, throughout the typhoon's nine-day trek, Sanba caused US$378.8 million in losses and killed six people. [CLS] [SEP]
