The February 1971 Mississippi Delta tornado outbreak struck portions of the Lower Mississippi River Valley and the Southeastern United States on February 21–22. [CLS] [SEP] The two-day tornado outbreak produced at least 19 tornadoes, and probably several more, mostly brief events in rural areas; killed 123 people across three states; and "virtually leveled" entire communities in the state of Mississippi. [CLS] [SEP] Three violent, long-lived tornadoes—two of which may have been tornado families—in western Mississippi and northeastern Louisiana caused most of the deaths along 300 miles (483 km) of path. [CLS] [SEP] One of the tornadoes attained F5 intensity in Louisiana, the only such event on record in the state, although the rating is disputed. [CLS] [SEP] The outbreak also generated strong tornadoes from Texas to Ohio and North Carolina. [CLS] [SEP] The entire outbreak is the second deadliest ever in February, behind only the Enigma tornado outbreak in 1884 and ahead of the 2008 Super Tuesday tornado outbreak. [CLS] [SEP] February 21 was the fourth-deadliest day for tornadoes in Mississippi on record. [CLS] [SEP] At one point, the National Weather Service WSR-57 radar in Jackson, Mississippi, reported four hook echoes, often indicative of tornado-producing supercells, simultaneously. [CLS] [SEP]
