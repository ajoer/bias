Intense Tropical Cyclone Indlala was a powerful tropical cyclone that struck northeastern Madagascar in March 2007. [CLS] [SEP] The ninth named storm and fifth intense tropical cyclone of the 2006–07 South-West Indian Ocean cyclone season, Indlala developed on March 3, 2007 southwest of the Chagos archipelago in the central Indian Ocean. [CLS] [SEP] Initially a tropical disturbance, Indlala moved generally westward in its formative stages, attaining tropical cyclone status on March 13. [CLS] [SEP] A day later, the Météo-France office on Réunion (MFR) estimated peak 10–minute sustained winds of 175 km/h (110 mph), although the American-based Joint Typhoon Warning Center estimated stronger 1–minute winds of 220 km/h (140 mph). [CLS] [SEP] Early on March 15, the cyclone made landfall in northeastern Madagascar on the Masoala Peninsula near Antalaha, still at its peak intensity according to the MFR. [CLS] [SEP] Indlala rapidly weakened over land and turned southward, eventually re-emerging into the Indian Ocean on March 18; it was last noted by the MFR on March 19. [CLS] [SEP] Indlala first affected the sparsely populated islands of St. [CLS] [SEP] Brandon and Agaléga, producing wind gusts of 65 km/h (40 mph) on the former island. [CLS] [SEP] The cyclone struck Madagascar a few months after the country experienced a series of deadly floods and other cyclones. [CLS] [SEP] Indlala killed 150 people and injured another 126. [CLS] [SEP] Monetary damage was estimated at over US$240 million. [CLS] [SEP] Severe flooding, strong winds, and heavy rainfall wrecked cities in the immediate vicinity of its landfall point. [CLS] [SEP] Farther inland and along the country's northwest coast, flooding cut access to roads, which disrupted the response to the storm. [CLS] [SEP] Individuals, national governments, United Nations agencies, and the International Federation of Red Cross and Red Crescent Societies helped residents affected by the cyclone cope with its aftermath.
