[CLS] Paul Ludwig Hans Anton von Beneckendorff und von Hindenburg (listen), known simply as Paul von Hindenburg (German: [ˈpaʊl fɔn ˈhɪndn̩bʊɐ̯k] (listen); 2 October 1847 – 2 August 1934), was a German general and statesman who led the Imperial German Army during World War I and later became President of Germany from 1925 until his death during the Weimar Republic. [SEP] [CLS] He played a key role in the Nazi Machtergreifung in January 1933 when, under pressure from advisers, he appointed Adolf Hitler as Chancellor of Germany. [SEP] [CLS] Paul von Hindenburg was born on 2 October 1847 to a family of minor Prussian nobility in the Prussian province of Posen. [SEP] [CLS] Upon completing his education as a cadet, he enlisted in the Third Regiment of Foot Guards as a second lieutenant. [SEP] [CLS] Hindenburg thereafter saw combat during the Austro-Prussian and Franco-Prussian wars. [SEP] [CLS] In 1873, he was admitted to the prestigious Kriegsakademie in Berlin where he studied for 3 years before being appointed to the General Staff Corps. [SEP] [CLS] Later in 1885, he was promoted to the rank of major and became a member of the Great General Staff. [SEP] [CLS] Following a five-year teaching stint at the Kriesgsacademie, Hindenburg steadily rose through the army's ranks to become a lieutenant-general by 1900. [SEP] [CLS] Around the time of his promotion to General of the Infantry in 1905, Count Alfred von Schlieffen recommended that he succeed him as Chief of the Great General Staff but the post ultimately went to Helmuth von Moltke. [SEP] [CLS] In 1911, Hindenburg announced his retirement from the military. [SEP] [CLS] Following the outbreak of World War I in July 1914, he was recalled to military service and received nationwide attention as the victor of Tannenberg on the Eastern Front. [SEP] [CLS] Subsequently, he oversaw a crushing series of defeats against the Russians that resulting in him becoming a figure of adulation among the German public and the center of a massive cult of personality. [SEP] [CLS] By 1916, Hindenburg was named Chief of the General Staff. [SEP] [CLS] As a result of Emperor Wilhelm II's broad delegation of authority to the German Army High Command, Hindenburg and his deputy, General Erich Ludendorff, ultimately established a de facto military dictatorship that controlled Germany for the rest of the war. [SEP] [CLS] Under their leadership, Germany defeated the forces of the Russian Empire in the East and achieved advances in the West deeper than any seen since the war's outbreak. [SEP] [CLS] However, by the end of 1918, any improvements in Germany's fortunes were reversed after its forces were decisively defeated in the Second Battle of the Marne and the Allies' Hundred Days Offensive. [SEP] [CLS] Hindenburg retired again in 1919, but returned to public life in 1925 to be elected the second President of Germany. [SEP] [CLS] He defeated Hitler in a runoff to win re-election in 1932. [SEP] [CLS] He was opposed to Hitler and was a major player in the increasing political instability in the Weimar Republic that ended with Hitler's rise to power. [SEP] [CLS] He dissolved the Reichstag twice in 1932 and finally agreed to appoint Hitler as Chancellor of Germany in January 1933. [SEP] [CLS] Hindenburg did this to satisfy Hitler's demands that he should play a part in the Weimar government, for Hitler was the leader of the Nazi party, which had won a plurality in the November 1932 elections. [SEP] [CLS] In February he approved the Reichstag Fire Decree, which suspended various civil liberties, and in March signed the Enabling Act of 1933, which gave Hitler's regime arbitrary powers. [SEP] [CLS] Hindenburg died the following year, after which Hitler declared himself Führer und Reichskanzler, or Supreme Leader and Chancellor, which superseded both the Presidency and Chancellorship.
