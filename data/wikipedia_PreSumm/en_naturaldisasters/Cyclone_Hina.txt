[CLS] Severe Tropical Cyclone Hina in March 1997 was the worst tropical cyclone to affect the South Pacific island nation of Tonga since Cyclone Isaac in 1982. [SEP] [CLS] The system was first noted within the monsoon trough on March 11, 1997, as a weak shallow depression within the vicinity of Rotuma. [SEP] [CLS] Over the next two days, the depression remained near Rotuma with no preferred movement, as it started to develop further within favorable conditions for further development. [SEP] [CLS] The system was subsequently named Hina on March 15, after it had started to move eastwards and had passed to the southeast of Niulakita, Tuvalu. [SEP] [CLS] During that day the system moved south-eastwards and impacted Wallis and Futuna, before it passed over Tonga's southern islands of Tongatapu and 'Eua during March 16. [SEP] [CLS] After impacting Tonga the system moved rapidly towards the south-southeast and weakened below tropical cyclone intensity, before it was last noted on March 21 about 1,500 km (930 mi) to the south of the Pitcairn Islands. [SEP] [CLS] During the systems post analysis it was determined that the warning centers had underestimated Hina's intensity as it passed over Tonga, after damage had been greater than expected in the island nation. [SEP] [CLS] Within Tuvalu it was difficult to assess damage done by Hina alone, after Cyclone Gavin impacted the area a week earlier. [SEP] [CLS] Storm surge and strong winds from both cyclones caused a severe amount of coastal erosion on all of the countryâ€™s nine atolls, with about 6.7% of land washed into the sea. [SEP] [CLS] Hina caused no significant damage on Walls Island, while it caused some damage to crops and destroyed parts of the road on Futuna Island. [SEP] [CLS] As Hina affected Tonga, there were no casualties reported as the system affected the island nation, however, Vaiola Hospital reported that they had treated a number of patients for injuries that were caused during the systems aftermath. [SEP] [CLS] One indirect death was also reported, after a person suffering a heart attack while evacuating from his home. [SEP] [CLS] The cyclone left extensive damage to utilities and agriculture on Tongatapu, where trees were uprooted and more than 12,000 tonnes (26,000,000 lb) of fruit and food crops were destroyed, mostly to banana and coconut trees. [SEP] [CLS] After the cyclone the Tongan Government requested and received emergency aid, from the governments of several countries including France, Australia, New Zealand, Japan and the United Kingdom. [SEP] [CLS] This was after the government had provided T$5 million (US$3.97 million), or about 5% of its national budget to facilitate the immediate start of emergency relief and repairs to essential services.
