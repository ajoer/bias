Typhoon Keith was the tenth of a record eleven super typhoons to develop during the unusually intense 1997 Pacific typhoon season. [CLS] [SEP] Originating from a near-equatorial trough on October 26, the precursor depression to Keith slowly organized into a tropical storm. [CLS] [SEP] After two days of gradual strengthening, the storm underwent a period of rapid intensification on October 30 as winds increased to 195 km/h (120 mph). [CLS] [SEP] On November 1, the storm further intensified into a super typhoon and later attained peak winds of 285 km/h (180 mph). [CLS] [SEP] The following day, the powerful storm passed between Rota and Tinian in the Northern Mariana Islands. [CLS] [SEP] After fluctuating in strength over the following few days, a steady weakening trend established itself by November 5 as the typhoon accelerated towards the northeast. [CLS] [SEP] On October 8, Keith transitioned into an extratropical cyclone and was last noted early the following day near the International Dateline. [CLS] [SEP] Despite Typhoon Keith's close passage to the islands of Rota and Tinian as a powerful storm, neither island received sustained winds over 160 km/h (105 mph). [CLS] [SEP] However, these winds resulted in significant damage across the island chain. [CLS] [SEP] More than 800 homes were damaged or destroyed by the storm and losses amounted to $15 million (1997 USD). [CLS] [SEP] There were no reports of fatalities in relation to the storm; however, one person was injured. [CLS] [SEP]
