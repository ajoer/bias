Tropical Storm Amelia was a weak but catastrophic tropical storm that was the second-wettest tropical cyclone on record in the continental United States. [CLS] [SEP] Amelia developed from a tropical wave that moved through the Atlantic Ocean uneventfully. [CLS] [SEP] The disturbance then entered an area of the Gulf of Mexico that was conducive to tropical cyclogenesis and became the first tropical depression of the season, after which it was forecast to make landfall before any significant intensification. [CLS] [SEP] However, the tropical depression defied predictions, quickly strengthening into a weak tropical storm just hours before making landfall in Corpus Christi. [CLS] [SEP] The storm lasted roughly a day over land before becoming unidentifiable after being active for just under 48 hours. [CLS] [SEP] After dissipating, the storm caused a severe flooding disaster in Texas. [CLS] [SEP] Amelia affected the Texas coast for two days which caused several shipping incidents and minor damage in Corpus Christi and South Padre Island. [CLS] [SEP] While active, there were no deaths linked to the storm. [CLS] [SEP] However, the biggest impact from the storm followed its dissipation, when its remnants contributed to record rainfall totals over the state. [CLS] [SEP] The state, already suffering from a previous drought, believed that the rain would help alleviate the conditions. [CLS] [SEP] However, the dry ground aided the flooding from the storm. [CLS] [SEP] The rainfall caused several rivers and creeks to flood, especially around the Texas Hill Country and northern Texas, leading to severe damage. [CLS] [SEP] Following the storm, President Jimmy Carter declared six counties in the state as federal disaster areas, allowing residents to seek aid from the government. [CLS] [SEP] Additional aid was brought in from as far away as New York. [CLS] [SEP] Overall, Amelia caused 33 fatalities with an estimated $110 million in damages in what then-governor Dolph Briscoe called one of the worst floods in the history of the state.
