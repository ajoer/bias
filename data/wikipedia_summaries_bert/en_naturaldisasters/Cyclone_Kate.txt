[CLS] Hurricane Kate was the final in a series of tropical cyclones to impact the United States during 1985, and the latest in any calendar year to strike the country at hurricane intensity on record. [SEP] [CLS] The eleventh named storm, seventh hurricane, and third major hurricane of the annual hurricane season, Kate originated from the interaction of an upper-level trough and tropical wave northeast of Puerto Rico on November 15. [SEP] [CLS] Though the system tracked erratically during the first hours of its existence, the intensification of a region of high pressure to the cyclone's north caused Kate to turn westward. [SEP] [CLS] A favorable atmospheric pattern allowed the newly developed system to intensify to hurricane intensity on November 16, and further to Category 2 intensity three days later. [SEP] [CLS] Kate made its first landfall on the northern coast of Cuba at this intensity prior to emerging as a slightly weaker storm during the evening hours of November 19. [SEP] [CLS] Once clear of land, it began to strengthen quickly, becoming a Category 3 and reaching its peak intensity of 120 mph (195 km/h) the following day. [SEP] [CLS] On November 21, a cold front moving across the Mississippi Valley resulted in a north and eventual northeast turn of the cyclone, and on November 22, Kate came ashore near Mexico Beach, Florida, as a minimal Category 2 hurricane with winds of 100 mph (160 km/h) . [SEP] [CLS] Gradual weakening ensued as the cyclone moved along the Southeast United States coastline, and Kate transitioned to an extratropical cyclone on November 23, a day after exiting the coastline of North Carolina. [SEP] [CLS] The threat of Hurricane Kate in Cuba prompted the evacuation of 360,000 people. [SEP] [CLS] Heavy rainfall in Cuba caused numerous mudslides and flooding, killing 10 people and leading to severe agriculture damage. [SEP] [CLS] Wind gusts over hurricane intensity resulted in widespread power outages, significant building damage, and major crop damage. [SEP] [CLS] Damage totaled roughly $400 million, making it the most damaging hurricane to strike the island in many decades. [SEP] [CLS] In preparation for the system's arrival, many hurricane watches and warnings were put into effect. [SEP] [CLS] Hundreds of thousands of residents were evacuated, and Florida governor Bob Graham declared a state of emergency for six counties; this was later cancelled following the relatively minor impacts of Kate. [SEP] [CLS] In addition, many shelters were opened. [SEP] [CLS] When Kate struck the Florida Panhandle, it became the first hurricane to make landfall in that location since Hurricane Eloise in 1975. [SEP] [CLS] Storm surge and flooding rains destroyed much of the oyster industry, causing many people to lose their jobs in the weeks after the storm. [SEP] [CLS] Gusts over 100 mph (160 km/h) contributed to downed trees and building damage, while the combination of wind and rain led to downed power poles. [SEP] [CLS] Across the remainder of the southeast United States, several inches of rainfall led to flash flooding, damage to roadways, and major tree damage. [SEP] [CLS] Overall, Kate resulted in 15 fatalities and $700 million in damage. [SEP] [CLS]
