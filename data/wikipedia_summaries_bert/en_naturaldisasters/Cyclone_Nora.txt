Severe Tropical Cyclone Nora was a strong tropical cyclone that affected Far North Queensland and the northeastern Northern Territory during March 2018. [CLS] [SEP] The ninth named storm and third severe tropical cyclone of the 2017â€“18 Australian region cyclone season, Nora developed from a tropical low which formed near the Torres Strait on 19 March. [CLS] [SEP] The system initially moved quickly to the west-northwest, and then began tracking slowly southwestwards over the Arafura Sea while gradually developing. [CLS] [SEP] A turn to the east on 22 March brought the tropical low into a favourable environment for strengthening, and the system reached tropical cyclone intensity later that day. [CLS] [SEP] Nora then underwent a period of rapid intensification as it moved southeastwards into the Gulf of Carpentaria. [CLS] [SEP] The storm peaked on 23 March as a high-end Category 3 severe tropical cyclone with sustained winds of 155 km/h (100 mph) and a minimum barometric pressure of 958 hPa (28.29 inHg). [CLS] [SEP] Nora made landfall north of Pormpuraaw at about 13:00 UTC on 24 March as a minimal Category 3 system. [CLS] [SEP] Nora weakened steadily as it tracked southwards along the coast, and was downgraded to a tropical low the following day. [CLS] [SEP] Nora's remnants meandered over land for several days before moving back over the Gulf of Carpentaria and dissipating on 28 March. [CLS] [SEP] Nora was responsible for major impacts across large parts of Far North Queensland. [CLS] [SEP] Strong winds knocked down many trees and power lines in the towns of Pormpuraaw, Kowanyama and Mapoon, blocking roads and cutting power to more than 500 homes. [CLS] [SEP] Damage was caused to houses, council buildings, personal property and other buildings. [CLS] [SEP] Very heavy rainfall occurred across most of Cape York Peninsula and Far North Queensland. [CLS] [SEP] Many communities became isolated by floodwaters after roads were either blocked or damaged. [CLS] [SEP] Extreme rainfall fell in parts of Queensland's east coast, including 593.0 mm (23.3 in) in just 24 hours in Port Douglas. [CLS] [SEP] Flash flooding occurred in Cairns as a result of the intense rainfall, including in car parks, shopping centres and hotels. [CLS] [SEP] The torrential rain caused landslides that blocked highways in the region. [CLS] [SEP] Many people had to be rescued by emergency services after becoming trapped by floodwaters. [CLS] [SEP] Agricultural losses in crops and livestock, as well as damage to infrastructure, were also sustained when farms were flooded. [CLS] [SEP] The total economic impact of Severe Tropical Cyclone Nora is estimated to have exceeded AU$32.5 million (US$25 million). [CLS] [SEP]
