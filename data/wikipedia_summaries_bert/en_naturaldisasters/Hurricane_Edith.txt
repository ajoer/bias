[CLS] Hurricane Edith was the strongest hurricane to form during the 1971 Atlantic hurricane season and formerly the southernmost landfalling Category 5 hurricane on record in the Atlantic until 2007. [SEP] [CLS] Edith also stands as one of the only Category 5 Atlantic hurricanes to not have its name retired, next to 1953's Hurricane Carol and 2005's Hurricane Emily. [SEP] [CLS] Edith developed from a tropical wave on September 5 and quickly strengthened into a hurricane in the Caribbean Sea. [SEP] [CLS] Edith rapidly intensified on September 9 and made landfall on Cape Gracias a Dios as a Category 5 hurricane on the Saffir-Simpson Hurricane Scale. [SEP] [CLS] It quickly lost intensity over Central America and after briefly entering the Gulf of Honduras it crossed the Yucat√°n Peninsula in Mexico. [SEP] [CLS] After moving across the Gulf of Mexico a trough turned the storm to the northeast and Edith, after having restrengthened while accelerating towards the coast, made landfall on Louisiana with winds of 105 mph (170 km/h) on September 16. [SEP] [CLS] Edith steadily weakened over land and dissipated over Georgia on September 18. [SEP] [CLS] The hurricane killed two people when it passed near Aruba. [SEP] [CLS] Striking northeastern Central America as a Category 5 hurricane, Edith destroyed hundreds of homes and killed at least 35 people. [SEP] [CLS] In Texas high tides caused coastal flooding but little damage. [SEP] [CLS] Edith caused moderate to heavy damage in portions of Louisiana due to flooding and a tornado outbreak from the storm. [SEP] [CLS] One tornado, rated F3 on the Fujita Scale, damaged several homes and injured multiple people in Baton Rouge. [SEP] [CLS] The tornado outbreak extended eastward into Florida, of which a few destroyed entire buildings. [SEP] [CLS] Damage in the United States totaled US$25 million (1971 dollars, $158 million in 2019 dollars). [SEP] [CLS]
