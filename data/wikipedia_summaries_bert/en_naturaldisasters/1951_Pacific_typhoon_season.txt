The 1951 Pacific typhoon season was a generally below average season with multiple tropical cyclones striking the Philippines. [CLS] [SEP] With the exception of January, each month saw at least one tropical system develop; October was the most active month with four tropical cyclones forming. [CLS] [SEP] Overall, there were 21 tropical depressions, of which 17 became named storms; of those, there were 16 typhoons. [CLS] [SEP] The season began with the formation of a short-lived unnamed tropical storm on February 19, well east of the Philippines; Typhoon Georgia became the season's first named storm and typhoon after first developing in the open Pacific on March 20. [CLS] [SEP] In April, Typhoon Iris developed before intensifying into a super typhoon the following month; Iris was the first recorded instance of a Category 5-equivalent typhoon in the western Pacific. [CLS] [SEP] The final typhoon and storm of the year was Typhoon Babs, which remained at sea before dissipating on December 17. [CLS] [SEP] The scope of this article is limited to the Pacific Ocean, north of the equator and west of the International Date Line. [CLS] [SEP] Storms that form east of the date line and north of the equator are called hurricanes; see 1951 Pacific hurricane season. [CLS] [SEP] At the time, tropical storms that formed within this region of the western Pacific were named and identified by the United States Fleet Weather Center in Guam. [CLS] [SEP] However, the Japan Meteorological Agency (JMA), which was established five years later, identified four additional tropical cyclones during the season not tracked by the Fleet Weather Center; these analyzed systems did not receive names.
