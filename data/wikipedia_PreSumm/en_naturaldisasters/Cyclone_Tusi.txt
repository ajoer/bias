[CLS] Severe Tropical Cyclone Tusi was a tropical cyclone which affected the island nations of Tuvalu, Tokelau, Western Samoa, American Samoa, Niue and the Southern Cook Islands during January 1987. [SEP] [CLS] The precursor tropical depression to Cyclone Tusi developed on January 13, within a trough of low pressure near the island nation of Tuvalu. [SEP] [CLS] Over the next few days the system gradually developed further before it was named Tusi during January 16, after it had become equivalent to a modern-day category 1 tropical cyclone on the Australian tropical cyclone intensity scale. [SEP] [CLS] After being named the system gradually intensified as it moved southeastwards along the trough, between the islands of Fakaofo and Swains during January 17. [SEP] [CLS] Tusi's eye subsequently passed near or over American Samoa's Manu'a Islands early the next day, as the system peaked in intensity with 10-minute sustained wind speeds of 150 km/h (90 mph). [SEP] [CLS] The system subsequently posed a threat to the Southern Cook Islands, however this threat gradually diminished as Tusi moved southwards and approached 25S during January 20. [SEP] [CLS]
