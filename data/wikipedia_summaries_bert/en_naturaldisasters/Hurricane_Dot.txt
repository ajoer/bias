Hurricane Dot of August 1959 was at its time the costliest tropical cyclone in Hawaiian history. [CLS] [SEP] Dot was first identified as a strong tropical storm southeast of Hawaiʻi on August 1. [CLS] [SEP] The storm was potentially a continuation of a previously unnamed tropical cyclone that was monitored west of the Baja California Peninsula from July 24–27, but was never confirmed due to a lack of ship reports. [CLS] [SEP] Dot was quick to intensify, reaching hurricane intensity six hours after naming. [CLS] [SEP] By August 3, Dot reached its peak intensity, with maximum sustained winds reaching 150 mph (240 km/h). [CLS] [SEP] Intensity leveled off afterwards as Dot tracked westward before making a curve towards the northwest on August 5, after which the hurricane weakened at a faster clip. [CLS] [SEP] Dot made landfall the next day on Kauai as a minimal hurricane before dissipating west of the Hawaiian Islands on August 8. [CLS] [SEP] Dot produced heavy rainfall and gusty winds as it passed south of the Big Island, Lanai, Maui, Molokai, and Oahu, resulting in minor damage. [CLS] [SEP] In Oahu, some homes along the coast were unroofed, and damage from wave action was also reported. [CLS] [SEP] Damage from these four islands totaled US$150,000, and two indirect deaths occurred in Lanai. [CLS] [SEP] Extensive damage occurred on Kauai as Dot made landfall, producing wind gusts as high as 103 mph (166 km/h) and toppling trees and power lines. [CLS] [SEP] Widespread power outages affected the island, causing telecommunications and water systems to fail. [CLS] [SEP] Although infrastructure was damaged to an extent by floodwater and strong winds, crops suffered the most losses. [CLS] [SEP] Cane sugar crops sustained US$2.7 million in losses. [CLS] [SEP] Overall, damage from Dot across Hawaii totaled US$6 million, and a disaster area declaration and state of emergency took effect for the archipelago after the hurricane's passage.
