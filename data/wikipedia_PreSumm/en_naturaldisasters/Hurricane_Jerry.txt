[CLS] Hurricane Jerry caused minor damage in Texas and flash flooding in Kentucky and Virginia in October 1989. [SEP] [CLS] The fourteenth tropical cyclone, tenth named storm of the season, Jerry developed from a tropical wave in the Bay of Campeche on October 12. [SEP] [CLS] Initially a tropical depression, the system moved north-northwestward across the Gulf of Mexico and strengthened into Tropical Storm Jerry early on the following day. [SEP] [CLS] Jerry continuously deepened until October 14 and then maintained intensity while curving northeastward and briefly decelerating. [SEP] [CLS] Later that day, the storm re-curved north-northwestward. [SEP] [CLS] Jerry began to intensify on October 15 and soon became a Category 1 hurricane on the Saffirâ€“Simpson hurricane wind scale. [SEP] [CLS] Early on October 16, Jerry made landfall on Galveston Island, Texas with winds of 85 miles per hour (137 km/h). [SEP] [CLS] Less than six hours later, Jerry weakened to a tropical storm and then a tropical depression shortly thereafter. [SEP] [CLS] Late on October 16, Jerry was absorbed by a frontal system while situated over southwestern Arkansas. [SEP] [CLS] Storm surge and rough surf along the coast of Texas destroyed a 20-mile (32 km) section of Texas State Highway 87, which was never repaired. [SEP] [CLS] Due to strong winds, about 52,000 homes and businesses were left without electricity, most of them in the Galveston area. [SEP] [CLS] Many homes, businesses, and buildings were inflicted damage because of strong winds and three tornadoes spawned by the storm. [SEP] [CLS] Despite the issuance of a hurricane warning just eight hours prior to landfall, Jerry caused only three fatalities in Texas, possibly due to the storm's small size; a car fell over the Galveston Seawall, killing its three occupants. [SEP] [CLS] Minor wind and coastal flood damage was reported in Louisiana. [SEP] [CLS] Jerry and its remnants brought flash flooding to portions of the Upland South, particularly in the states of Kentucky, Virginia, and West Virginia. [SEP] [CLS] In eastern Kentucky, hundreds of homes were flooded and many bridges, culverts, and roads were washed out; this left hundreds of residents stranded. [SEP] [CLS] Damage in Kentucky reached at least $5 million. [SEP] [CLS] Similar impact occurred in Virginia; with $3.4 million (1989 USD) in damage in Buchanan County. [SEP] [CLS] In West Virginia, overflowing rivers in the western portions of the state forced hundreds to evacuate. [SEP] [CLS] Throughout the United States, Jerry resulted in about $70 million in damage. [SEP] [CLS]
