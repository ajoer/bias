Cyclone Fay was an intense, late-season tropical cyclone which struck Western Australia during the 2003â€“04 Australian region cyclone season. [CLS] [SEP] Forming from an area of low pressure on 12 March, Fay was the only Category 5 cyclone during the season. [CLS] [SEP] The system had a minimum pressure of 910 mbar (hPa; 26.87 inHg) and maximum sustained winds of 210 km/h (130 mph). [CLS] [SEP] Moving towards the southwest and eventually towards the south, Fay gradually strengthened as it paralleled the northwestern coast of Australia, and made landfall on the Pilbara coast on the morning of 27 March as a Category 4 cyclone. [CLS] [SEP] While no fatalities were reported, the cyclone brought record-breaking rainfall to Australia, which led to a sharp decrease in the country's gold output. [CLS] [SEP] The cyclone also caused minor damage in the Pilbara region of Western Australia. [CLS] [SEP] In the spring of 2005, the Australian Bureau of Meteorology retired the name Fay from use, and it will never be used again as a cyclone name. [CLS] [SEP]
