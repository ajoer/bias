[CLS] British European Airways Flight 706 (BE706/BEA706) was a scheduled flight from Heathrow Airport in London, United Kingdom to Salzburg-W. [SEP] [CLS] A. [SEP] [CLS] Mozart Airport in Salzburg, Austria. [SEP] [CLS] The flight was operated by a Vickers Vanguard with a U.K registration of G-APEC. [SEP] [CLS] On 2 October 1971, whilst en route at 19,000 ft (5,791 m), 35 minutes after takeoff, the rear cabin pressure bulkhead failed. [SEP] [CLS] The resulting pressurisation of the tail section caused the surfaces of the tailplanes to separate, weakening them to the point that they broke off. [SEP] [CLS] Without a horizontal stabiliser the aircraft entered an uncontrollable dive. [SEP] [CLS] The aircraft crashed near Aarsele, Belgium, killing all 63 passengers and crew on impact. [SEP] [CLS] A piece of debris from the aircraft struck a passing car, causing minor injuries to one of its occupants. [SEP] [CLS] Investigators, in attempting to determine the cause of the accident, found corrosion in the lower part of the rear pressure bulkhead underneath plating that was bonded to the structure. [SEP] [CLS] The bulkhead had been eaten away. [SEP] [CLS] Fluid contamination, perhaps from the lavatory, was thought to have been the root cause for the corrosion. [SEP] [CLS] The corrosion was not detectable by then-current inspection techniques. [SEP] [CLS] The Belgian Civil Aeronautics Administration wrote the report and the British Air Accidents Investigation Branch had accredited personnel assisting the investigation. [SEP] [CLS]
