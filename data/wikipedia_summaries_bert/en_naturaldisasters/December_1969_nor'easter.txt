The December 1969 nor'easter was a strong winter storm that mainly affected the Northeastern United States and southern Quebec between December 25 and December 28, 1969. [CLS] [SEP] The multi-faceted storm system included a tornado outbreak, record snow accumulations, a damaging ice storm, and flooding rains. [CLS] [SEP] The storm developed over Texas by December 25 and advanced eastward, spawning over a dozen tornadoes in Louisiana, Georgia, and Florida. [CLS] [SEP] Upon reaching the Eastern Seaboard, the cyclone turned northeastward and intensified into a powerful nor'easter. [CLS] [SEP] On December 26 and 27, the storm's forward movement slowed to a drift, causing very heavy snow over Upstate New York, Vermont, and southern Quebec. [CLS] [SEP] Warm onshore winds, caused by a storm track close to the shore, allowed precipitation to change to sleet and rain in central and eastern New England. [CLS] [SEP] Where precipitation remained as snow, accumulations reached 40 inches (100 cm) or more, crippling travel. [CLS] [SEP] Drifts up to 30 ft (9.1 m) high blocked roadways, isolating some communities and forcing emergency workers to rely on snowmobiles for transportation. [CLS] [SEP] At least 20 fatalities were attributed to the storm in New York and New England. [CLS] [SEP] In central New England, a severe freezing rain event occurred along the boundary between cold air to the west and warmer air to the east. [CLS] [SEP] Several inches of glaze ice, accompanied by gale-force winds, caused damage comparable to the aftermath of the 1938 New England hurricane. [CLS] [SEP] Throughout the region, the snow and ice—in some cases further weighted by heavy rainfall—caused roofs to cave in. [CLS] [SEP] Montreal received 27.5 in (70 cm) of snow in that city's biggest snowstorm on record at the time; officials blamed the storm for 15 deaths in Quebec. [CLS] [SEP] In eastern New England, ice jams, poor drainage, and several inches of rain caused flooding that forced people from their homes and submerged roadways. [CLS] [SEP] Wind gusts to 100 mph (160 km/h) and strong waves battered the coastline. [CLS] [SEP]
