Extremely Severe Cyclonic Storm Nilofar was, at the time, the third-strongest cyclone in the Arabian Sea. [CLS] [SEP] In late October 2014, it reached peak maximum sustained winds estimated between 205 km/h (125 mph) and 215 km/h (130 mph). [CLS] [SEP] The India Meteorological Department (IMD) named it Nilofar; the name refers to the water lily, and was suggested by Pakistan. [CLS] [SEP] The western fringes of the storm caused flash flooding in northeastern Oman, killing four people. [CLS] [SEP] Nilofar originated from a low pressure area between India and the Arabian Peninsula. [CLS] [SEP] It developed into a depression on October 25 and moved generally northward through an area of favorable conditions. [CLS] [SEP] The system intensified into a cyclonic storm on October 26. [CLS] [SEP] Quickly organizing due to the conditions, Nilofar developed a well-defined eye and structure, attaining its peak intensity on October 28. [CLS] [SEP] At the time, Nilofar was expected to make landfall in western India, prompting evacuations and preparations.
