[CLS] The 1991 Pacific typhoon season has no official bounds; it ran year-round in 1991, but most tropical cyclones tend to form in the northwestern Pacific Ocean between May and November. [SEP] [CLS] These dates conventionally delimit the period of each year when most tropical cyclones form in the northwestern Pacific Ocean. [SEP] [CLS] The scope of this article is limited to the Pacific Ocean, north of the equator and west of the international date line. [SEP] [CLS] Storms that form east of the date line and north of the equator are called hurricanes; see 1991 Pacific hurricane season. [SEP] [CLS] Tropical Storms formed in the entire west pacific basin were assigned a name by the Joint Typhoon Warning Center. [SEP] [CLS] Tropical depressions in this basin have the "W" suffix added to their number. [SEP] [CLS] Tropical depressions that enter or form in the Philippine area of responsibility are assigned a name by the Philippine Atmospheric, Geophysical and Astronomical Services Administration or PAGASA. [SEP] [CLS] This can often result in the same storm having two names. [SEP] [CLS]
