Malaysia Airlines Flight 17 (MH17) was a scheduled passenger flight from Amsterdam to Kuala Lumpur that was shot down on 17 July 2014 while flying over eastern Ukraine. [CLS] [SEP] All 283 passengers and 15 crew were killed. [CLS] [SEP] Contact with the aircraft, a Boeing 777-200ER, was lost when it was about 50 km (31 mi) from the Ukraineâ€“Russia border, and wreckage of the aircraft fell near Hrabove in Donetsk Oblast, Ukraine, 40 km (25 mi) from the border. [CLS] [SEP] It was Malaysia Airlines' second aircraft loss during 2014, after the disappearance of Flight 370 on 8 March. [CLS] [SEP] The shoot-down occurred in the War in Donbass, during the Battle in Shakhtarsk Raion, in an area controlled by pro-Russian rebels. [CLS] [SEP] The Ukrainian Air Force had suffered losses from increasingly sophisticated air defence weaponry. [CLS] [SEP] Immediately after contact with the aircraft was lost, the rebel militia in Donetsk claimed to have shot down a Ukrainian An-26 military transport airplane. [CLS] [SEP] When it became apparent that the wreckage that fell near Hrabove was from a civilian airliner, the separatists withdrew this claim and denied shooting down any aircraft.The responsibility for investigation was delegated to the Dutch Safety Board (DSB) and the Dutch-led joint investigation team (JIT), who concluded that the airliner was downed by a Buk surface-to-air missile launched from pro-Russian separatist-controlled territory in Ukraine. [CLS] [SEP] According to the JIT, the Buk that was used originated from the 53rd Anti-Aircraft Missile Brigade of the Russian Federation and had been transported from Russia on the day of the crash, fired from a field in a rebel-controlled area and returned to Russia afterwards. [CLS] [SEP] The findings by the DSB and JIT are consistent with the earlier claims by American and German intelligence sources and claims by the Ukrainian government. [CLS] [SEP] On the basis of the JIT's conclusions, the governments of the Netherlands and Australia held Russia responsible for the deployment of the Buk installation and were pursuing legal routes as of May 2018. [CLS] [SEP] The Russian government denied involvement in the shooting down of the airplane, and its account of how the aircraft was shot down has varied over time. [CLS] [SEP] Coverage in Russian media has also differed from that in other countries. [CLS] [SEP] Russia holds the Ukrainian government at fault for allowing civilian flights in a war zone.
