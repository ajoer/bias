[CLS] Tierra del Fuego (Spanish for "Land of Fire"; Spanish pronunciation: [ˈtjera ðel ˈfweɣo]; officially Provincia de Tierra del Fuego, Antártida e Islas del Atlántico Sur, Spanish for "Tierra del Fuego, Antarctica and South Atlantic Islands") is the southernmost and least populous Argentine province. [SEP] [CLS] The province had been inhabited by indigenous people for more than 12,000 years, since they migrated south of the mainland. [SEP] [CLS] It was first encountered by a European in 1520 when spotted by Ferdinand Magellan. [SEP] [CLS] Even after Argentina achieved independence, this territory remained under indigenous control until the nation's campaign known as the Conquest of the Desert in the 1870s. [SEP] [CLS] After slaughtering most of the native population in the desert part of Patagonia, Argentina organized this section in 1885 as a territory. [SEP] [CLS] European immigration followed due to a gold rush and rapid expansion of sheep farming on large ranches in the area. [SEP] [CLS] Tierra del Fuego is the most recent Argentine territory to gain provincial status, which occurred in 1990. [SEP] [CLS]
