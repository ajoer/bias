[CLS] The 1867 Manhattan earthquake struck Riley County, Kansas, in the United States on April 24, 1867 at 20:22 UTC, or about 14:30 local time. [SEP] [CLS] The strongest earthquake to originate in the state, it measured 5.1 on a seismic scale that is based on an isoseismal map or the event's felt area. [SEP] [CLS] The earthquake's epicenter was near the town of Manhattan. [SEP] [CLS] The earthquake had a maximum perceived intensity of VII (Very strong) on the Mercalli intensity scale. [SEP] [CLS] It caused minor damage, reports of which were confined to Kansas, Iowa, and Missouri, according to the United States Geological Survey. [SEP] [CLS] Felt over an area of 200,000 square miles (520,000 km2), the earthquake reached the states of Indiana, Illinois, and possibly Ohio, though the latter reports have been questioned. [SEP] [CLS] Manhattan is near the Nemaha Ridge, a long anticline structure that is bounded by several faults. [SEP] [CLS] The nearby Humboldt Fault Zone in particular poses a threat to the city. [SEP] [CLS] Kansas is not known for earthquake activity, but an earthquake could occur at any time. [SEP] [CLS] A 2016 hazard map from the United States Geological Survey estimated a 1% or lower risk for a major earthquake in Kansas for the following year, though scientists from the agency think an earthquake of magnitude 7.0 remains possible.
