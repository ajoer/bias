Typhoon Ivan, known in the Philippines as Typhoon Narsing, was an intense tropical cyclone that existed simultaneously with another storm of the same intensity, Typhoon Joan, in October 1997. [CLS] [SEP] Forming out of an area of disturbed weather on October 13, Ivan gradually intensified into a typhoon as it tracked steadily to the west-northwest. [CLS] [SEP] On October 15, the storm underwent rapid intensification and reached an intensity corresponding to Category 5 status on the Saffirâ€“Simpson Hurricane Scale. [CLS] [SEP] Late on October 17, Ivan reached its peak strength with winds of 295 km/h (185 mph) and a barometric pressure of 905 hPa (mbar). [CLS] [SEP] Shortly thereafter, the typhoon began to weaken as it approached the Philippines. [CLS] [SEP] Ivan eventually made landfall in northern Luzon with winds of 220 km/h (140 mph) on October 20 before weakening to a tropical storm the next day. [CLS] [SEP] The storm then curved northeastward and became extratropical on October 25 and dissipating the following day. [CLS] [SEP] Although Ivan was a powerful storm at landfall, its effects were relatively minor compared to the storms' intensity; however, 14 people were killed during the storm and two others were listed as missing. [CLS] [SEP] Agricultural industries sustained the most severe damage, as thousands of animals drowned in the storm. [CLS] [SEP] Total damage was estimated at $9.6 million (1997 USD; $13.1 million 2009 USD). [CLS] [SEP] A total of 1,779 homes were destroyed, 13,771 others were damaged and 4,600 hectares of farmland were flooded by the storm. [CLS] [SEP]
