[CLS] Hurricane Maria was a Category 1 hurricane that made landfall on the island of Newfoundland during September 2011. [SEP] [CLS] Originating from a tropical wave over the central Atlantic on September 6, Maria moved toward the west and slowly strengthened. [SEP] [CLS] While approaching the northern Leeward Islands, however, the system entered a region of higher vertical wind shear and cooler sea surface temperatures, causing it to degenerate into a low-pressure area. [SEP] [CLS] It slowly curved toward the north and northeast around the western periphery of the subtropical ridge, and regained tropical storm status on September 10. [SEP] [CLS] Maria further strengthened to attain hurricane status while making its closest approach to Bermuda. [SEP] [CLS] The cyclone attained peak winds of 80 mph (130 km/h) on September 16, but weakened thereafter because of an increase in wind shear and cooler sea surface temperatures. [SEP] [CLS] Maria made landfall on the southeastern coast of Newfoundland during the afternoon hours of September 16 before becoming absorbed by a frontal system later on that same day. [SEP] [CLS] Despite its poor organization, Maria brought heavy rainfall to portions of the east Caribbean, notably Puerto Rico. [SEP] [CLS] Numerous roadways and homes were flooded, and as the storm passed through the extreme northeastern Caribbean, over 15,000 people went without power. [SEP] [CLS] In addition, tropical storm-force winds were observed on many of the U.S. [SEP] [CLS] Virgin Islands. [SEP] [CLS] As the system passed west of Bermuda, brief tropical storm-force sustained winds were recorded, along with higher gusts; rainfall on the island, however, was minimal. [SEP] [CLS] In Newfoundland, strong winds were recorded, but rainfall totals were relatively minimal. [SEP] [CLS] There were no deaths reported in association with Maria, although the storm caused $1.3 million (2011 USD) in damage. [SEP] [CLS]
