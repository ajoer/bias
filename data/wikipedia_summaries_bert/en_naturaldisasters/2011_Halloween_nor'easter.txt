[CLS] The 2011 Halloween nor'easter, sometimes referred to as "Snowtober," "Shocktober," "Storm Alfred," and "Oktoberblast," was a large low pressure area that produced unusually early snowfall across the northeastern United States and the Canadian Maritimes. [SEP] [CLS] It formed early on October 29 along a cold front to the southeast of the Carolinas. [SEP] [CLS] As it moved up the East Coast, its associated snowfall broke records in at least 20 cities for total accumulations, resulting in a rare "white Halloween" two days later. [SEP] [CLS] The storm arrived just two months after Hurricane Irene caused extensive power outages and property damage in the Northeast; with the 2011 New England tornado outbreak also causing damage in Western Massachusetts. [SEP] [CLS] It dumped snow on trees that were often still in leaf, adding extra weight, with the ground in some areas still soft from a preceding warm, rainy period that increased the possibility trees could be uprooted. [SEP] [CLS] Trees and branches that collapsed caused considerable damage, particularly to power lines, with estimates of storm costs ranging between $1 billion and $3 billion. [SEP] [CLS] In all, 3.2 million U.S. [SEP] [CLS] residences and businesses in 12 states experienced power outages, with the storm also impacting three Canadian provinces. [SEP] [CLS] Some customers in Connecticut did not get power back until early November; many outages lasted 11 days Many communities chose to postpone celebrations of Halloween from two days to a week later as a result, or cancel them entirely. [SEP] [CLS] Delays in restoring power led to the resignation of the chief operating officer of Connecticut Light & Power amid widespread criticism of the company's mishandling of both the nor'easter and Irene.
