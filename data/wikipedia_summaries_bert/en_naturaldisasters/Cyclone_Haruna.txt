Tropical Cyclone Haruna was a deadly storm that produced widespread flooding and a disease outbreak in southwestern Madagascar. [CLS] [SEP] The ninth system of the season, Haruna developed in the Mozambique channel in the middle of February 2013 between Mozambique and southwestern Madagascar. [CLS] [SEP] Initially moving northward over Mozambique, the disturbance later moved slowly southward, gradually strengthening into the eighth named storm of the season and later into an intense tropical cyclone. [CLS] [SEP] The Météo-France office in Réunion (MFR) – the official Regional Specialized Meteorological Center in the basin – estimated the cyclone attained peak 10 minute sustained winds of 150 km/h (90 mph). [CLS] [SEP] Haruna made landfall near Morombe in southwestern Madagascar on February 22. [CLS] [SEP] It weakened significantly while crossing the country, and MFR discontinued advisories on February 24 after the storm had emerged into the Indian Ocean. [CLS] [SEP] Before Haruna struck Madagascar, a pre-existing system produced deadly flooding, and when the cyclone crossed the country, it added additional rainfall to the region. [CLS] [SEP] Flooding was worst in Toliara where a dyke burst, flooding much of the town and leaving residents without water or power. [CLS] [SEP] Many villages in southwestern Madagascar lost access to clean water, prompting various international agencies to deploy teams to decontaminate wells. [CLS] [SEP] Haruna destroyed 7,402 houses, which left 13,882 people homeless. [CLS] [SEP] Most of the displaced people were able to leave their shelters by early April. [CLS] [SEP] The cyclone damaged rice and maize crops along the coast, although there were extended residual effects when a locust outbreak occurred, affecting half of Madagascar's farmlands by July 2013. [CLS] [SEP] Throughout Madagascar, Haruna killed 26 people and injured 127 directly, and there were outbreaks of various diseases in the storm's aftermath. [CLS] [SEP]
