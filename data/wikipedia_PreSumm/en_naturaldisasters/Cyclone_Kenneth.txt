[CLS] Intense Tropical Cyclone Kenneth was the strongest tropical cyclone to make landfall in Mozambique since modern records began. [SEP] [CLS] The cyclone also caused significant damage in the Comoro Islands and Tanzania. [SEP] [CLS] The fourteenth tropical storm, record-breaking tenth tropical cyclone, and tenth intense tropical cyclone of the 2018–19 South-West Indian Ocean cyclone season, Kenneth formed from a vortex that the Météo-France office on La Réunion (MFR) first mentioned on 17 April. [SEP] [CLS] The MFR monitored the system over the next several days, before designating it as Tropical Disturbance 14 on 21 April. [SEP] [CLS] The disturbance was located in a favorable environment to the north of Madagascar, which allowed it to strengthen into a tropical depression and later a tropical storm, both on the next day. [SEP] [CLS] The storm then began a period of rapid intensification, ultimately peaking as an intense tropical cyclone with 10-minute sustained winds of 215 km/h (130 mph) and a minimum central pressure of 934 hPa (27.58 inHg). [SEP] [CLS] At that time, Kenneth began to undergo an eyewall replacement cycle and weakened slightly, before making landfall later that day as an intense tropical cyclone. [SEP] [CLS] As a result of land interaction, Kenneth became disorganised as it made landfall and rapidly degenerated thereafter. [SEP] [CLS] The storm then shifted southward, with the MFR cancelling all major warnings for inland cities. [SEP] [CLS] Kenneth was reclassified as an overland depression after landfall, with the MFR issuing its warning at midnight UTC on 26 April. [SEP] [CLS] Thunderstorm activity developed off the coast of Mozambique on 27 April as the system began drifting northward. [SEP] [CLS] Kenneth re-emerged off the coast of northern Mozambique on 28 April, before dissipating on the next day. [SEP] [CLS] Prior to Kenneth's landfall, local authorities evacuated over 30,000 people in the path of the storm in northern Mozambique. [SEP] [CLS] Kenneth killed at least 52 people in total; in the country of Comoros; Kenneth's wind and rainfall caused at least seven deaths, while 45 people were killed in Mozambique. [SEP] [CLS] Damage is currently estimated at $100 million (2019 USD). [SEP] [CLS]
