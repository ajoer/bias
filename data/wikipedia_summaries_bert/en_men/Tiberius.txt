Tiberius ( ty-BEER-ee-əs; Tiberius Caesar Augustus; 16 November 42 BC – 16 March 37 AD) was the second Roman emperor, reigning from AD 14 to 37. [CLS] [SEP] He succeeded his stepfather, Augustus. [CLS] [SEP] Born to Tiberius Claudius Nero and Livia Drusilla to a family of the noted patrician gens Claudia, he was given the name Tiberius Claudius Nero. [CLS] [SEP] His mother divorced Nero and married Octavian—later to ascend to Emperor as Augustus—who officially became his stepfather. [CLS] [SEP] Tiberius would later marry Augustus' daughter (from his marriage to Scribonia), Julia the Elder, and even later be adopted by Augustus. [CLS] [SEP] Through the adoption, he officially became a Julian, assuming the name Tiberius Julius Caesar. [CLS] [SEP] The emperors after Tiberius would continue this blended dynasty of both families for the following thirty years; historians have named it the Julio-Claudian dynasty. [CLS] [SEP] His relationship to the other emperors of this dynasty was as follows: he was the stepson of Augustus, grand-uncle of Caligula, paternal uncle of Claudius, and great-grand uncle of Nero. [CLS] [SEP] Tiberius' 22-and-a-half-year reign would be the longest after that of Augustus until that of Emperor Antoninus Pius, who surpassed his reign by a few months. [CLS] [SEP] Tiberius was one of the greatest Roman generals; his conquest of Pannonia, Dalmatia, Raetia, and (temporarily) parts of Germania laid the foundations for the northern frontier. [CLS] [SEP] Even so, he came to be remembered as a dark, reclusive and sombre ruler who never really desired to be emperor; Pliny the Elder called him "the gloomiest of men". [CLS] [SEP] After the death of his son Drusus Julius Caesar in AD 23, Tiberius became more reclusive and aloof. [CLS] [SEP] In 26 AD he removed himself from Rome and left administration largely in the hands of his unscrupulous Praetorian prefects Lucius Aelius Sejanus and Quintus Naevius Sutorius Macro. [CLS] [SEP] When Tiberius died, he was succeeded by his grand-nephew and adopted grandson, Caligula. [CLS] [SEP]
