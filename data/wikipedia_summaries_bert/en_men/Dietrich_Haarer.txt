Women in Nazi Germany were subject to doctrines of Nazism by the Nazi Party (NSDAP), promoting exclusion of women from political life of Germany along with its executive body as well as its executive committees. [CLS] [SEP] Although the Nazi party decreed that "women could be admitted to neither the Party executive nor to the Administrative Committee", due to numerous cases and extreme lack or organisation and skill this did not prevent numerous women from becoming party members. [CLS] [SEP] The Nazi doctrine elevated the role of German men, emphasizing their combat skills and the brotherhood among male compatriots.Women lived within a regime characterized by a policy of allowing and encouraging them to fill the roles of mother and wife and excluding them from all positions of responsibility, notably in the political and academic spheres. [CLS] [SEP] The policies of Nazism contrasted starkly with the evolution of women's rights and gender equality under the Weimar Republic, and is equally distinguishable from the mostly male-dominated and conservative attitude under the German Empire. [CLS] [SEP] The regimentation of women at the heart of satellite organizations of the Nazi Party, as the Bund Deutscher Mädel or the NS-Frauenschaft, had the ultimate goal of encouraging the cohesion of the "people's community" (Volksgemeinschaft). [CLS] [SEP] First and foremost in the implied Nazi doctrine concerning women was the notion of motherhood and procreation for those of child-bearing ages. [CLS] [SEP] The Nazi model woman did not have a career, but was responsible for the education of her children and for housekeeping. [CLS] [SEP] Women only had a limited right to training revolving around domestic tasks, and were, over time, restricted from teaching in universities, from medical professions and from serving in political positions within the NSDAP. [CLS] [SEP] Many restrictions were lifted once wartime necessity dictated changes to policy later in the regime's existence. [CLS] [SEP] With the exception of Reichsführerin Gertrud Scholtz-Klink, no women were allowed to carry out official functions, however some exceptions stood out in the regime, either through their proximity to Adolf Hitler, such as Magda Goebbels, or by excelling in particular fields, such as filmmaker Leni Riefenstahl or aviator Hanna Reitsch. [CLS] [SEP] The historiography of "ordinary" German women in Nazi Germany has changed significantly over time; early studies after the war tended to see women as another victim of oppression by the Nazis. [CLS] [SEP] However, during the late 20th century, historians began to look at German women's agency within Nazi Germany and argue that they were able to influence the course of the regime and even the war, as well as how women's experience varied by class, age and religion.Henceforth, while many women played an influential role at the heart of the Nazi system or filled official posts at the heart of the Nazi concentration camps, a few were engaged in the German resistance and paid with their lives, such as Libertas Schulze-Boysen or Sophie Scholl.
