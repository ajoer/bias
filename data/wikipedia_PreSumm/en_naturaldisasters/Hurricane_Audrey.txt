[CLS] Hurricane Audrey was one of the deadliest tropical cyclones in U.S. [SEP] [CLS] history, killing at least 416 people in its devastation of the southwestern Louisiana coast in 1957. [SEP] [CLS] Along with Hurricane Alex in 2010, it was also the strongest June hurricane ever recorded in the Atlantic basin as measured by pressure. [SEP] [CLS] The rapidly developing storm struck southwestern Louisiana as an intense Category 3 hurricane, destroying coastal communities with a powerful storm surge that penetrated as far as 20 mi (32 km) inland. [SEP] [CLS] Audrey was the first named storm and hurricane of the 1957 hurricane season. [SEP] [CLS] It formed on June 24 from a tropical wave that moved into the Bay of Campeche. [SEP] [CLS] Situated within ideal conditions for tropical development, Audrey quickly strengthened, reaching hurricane status a day afterwards. [SEP] [CLS] Moving north, it continued to strengthen and accelerate as it approached the United States Gulf Coast. [SEP] [CLS] On June 27, the hurricane reached peak sustained winds of 125 mph (205 km/h), making it a major hurricane. [SEP] [CLS] At the time, Audrey had a minimum barometric pressure of 946 mbar (hPa; 27.91 inHg). [SEP] [CLS] The hurricane made landfall with the same intensity between the mouth of the Sabine River and Cameron, Louisiana, later that day, causing unprecedented destruction across the region. [SEP] [CLS] Once inland, Audrey weakened and turned extratropical over West Virginia on June 29. [SEP] [CLS] Prior to making landfall, Audrey severely disrupted offshore drilling operations in the Gulf of Mexico. [SEP] [CLS] Damages from offshore oil facilities alone was estimated at $16 million. [SEP] [CLS] Audrey caused much of its destruction near the border between Texas and Louisiana. [SEP] [CLS] The hurricane's strong winds resulted in widespread property and infrastructural damage. [SEP] [CLS] Power outages also resulted from the strong winds. [SEP] [CLS] However, as is typical with most landfalling tropical cyclones, most of the destruction at the coast was the result of the hurricane's strong storm surge, which was amplified by Audrey's rapid strengthening just prior to landfall. [SEP] [CLS] The storm surge was reported to have peaked as high as 12 ft (3.7 m), inundating coastal areas. [SEP] [CLS] Damage from the surge alone extended 25 mi (40 km) inland. [SEP] [CLS] The rough seas killed nine people offshore after capsizing the boat they were in. [SEP] [CLS] Further inland in Louisiana, the storm spawned two tornadoes, causing additional damage. [SEP] [CLS] Audrey also dropped heavy rainfall, peaking at 10.63 in (270 mm) near Basile. [SEP] [CLS] In Louisiana and Texas, where Audrey first impacted, the damage toll was $128 million. [SEP] [CLS] After moving inland and transitioning into an extratropical cyclone, Audrey caused additional damage across the interior United States. [SEP] [CLS] The storm produced 18 tornadoes across Mississippi and Alabama, causing $600,000 in losses and killing one person. [SEP] [CLS] As it moved towards the northeast, moisture associated with the extratropical remnants of Audrey intersected with a cold front over the Midwest, producing record rainfall that peaked at 10.20 in (259.08 mm) in Paris, Illinois. [SEP] [CLS] The resultant flooding killed 10 people. [SEP] [CLS] Elsewhere in the United States, the storm brought strong winds that wrought additional damage. [SEP] [CLS] Farther north, in Canada, 15 people were killed in Ontario and Quebec. [SEP] [CLS] Strong winds and torrential rainfall disrupted transportation services. [SEP] [CLS] In Quebec, ten people were killed in the Montreal area, making Audrey the deadliest hurricane to strike the Canadian province in recorded history. [SEP] [CLS] The storm was also considered the worst storm to strike Quebec in at least 20 years. [SEP] [CLS] In the United States, Audrey killed at least 416 people, the majority of whom were in Cameron Parish, Louisiana, though the final death total may never be known. [SEP] [CLS] Damage totaled $147 million in the country, at the time the fifth-costliest hurricane recorded in the US since 1900. [SEP] [CLS] The name Audrey was later retired from usage as an identifier for an Atlantic hurricane. [SEP] [CLS]
