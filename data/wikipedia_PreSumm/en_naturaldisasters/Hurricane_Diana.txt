[CLS] Hurricane Diana was a deadly tropical cyclone which struck Mexico in August 1990. [SEP] [CLS] The fourth named storm and second hurricane of the season, Diana developed from a tropical wave in the southwestern Caribbean Sea on August 4. [SEP] [CLS] Forming as a tropical depression, the system brushed Honduras before intensifying into a tropical storm the following day. [SEP] [CLS] Continuing to gradually strengthen, Diana made its first landfall in Mexico's Yucatán Peninsula as a strong tropical storm late on August 5. [SEP] [CLS] The cyclone weakened slightly due to land interaction, before emerging into the Bay of Campeche on August 6. [SEP] [CLS] Once over water, warm sea surface temperatures allowed Diana to quickly become a hurricane and later peak as a Category 2 on the Saffir–Simpson Hurricane Scale on August 7. [SEP] [CLS] Shortly thereafter, the storm made landfall near Tampico, Tamaulipas, with winds of 100 mph (165 km/h). [SEP] [CLS] Rapid weakening ensued once the storm moved over the high terrain of Mexico, with Diana diminishing to a tropical depression roughly 24 hours after moving onshore. [SEP] [CLS] The cyclone later emerged into the Gulf of California on August 9 shortly before dissipating. [SEP] [CLS] The remnant disturbance was monitored until losing its identity over Arizona on August 14. [SEP] [CLS] Diana left relatively minor impacts in the Yucatán Peninsula. [SEP] [CLS] Some locations observed tropical storm-force sustained winds and gusts, while heavy rains left street flooding in the Chetumal area. [SEP] [CLS] Along the Gulf Coast of Mexico, the hurricane produced torrential rains exceeding 20 in (510 mm) in some places. [SEP] [CLS] The ensuing floods left about 3,500 people homeless and destroyed roughly 155 mi² (400 km²) of farmland. [SEP] [CLS] Numerous roads and railways were either washed out or blocked by debris, cutting communication with several communities. [SEP] [CLS] In all, Diana killed 139 people in Mexico and resulted in approximately $90.7 million (1990 USD) in damage. [SEP] [CLS] The remnant disturbance caused street flooding in Arizona. [SEP] [CLS] The World Meteorological Organization retired the name Diana following the season due to the extensive loss of life and damage caused by the storm. [SEP] [CLS]
