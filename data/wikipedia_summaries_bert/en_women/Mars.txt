Mor (vernacular pronunciation) or Mar (from Classical Syriac: ܡܪܝ‎ Mār(y), written with a silent final yodh) is a title of respect in Syriac, literally meaning 'my lord'. [CLS] [SEP] It is given to all saints and is also used before Christian name of bishops. [CLS] [SEP] The corresponding feminine form given to women saints is Marth or Morth (Syriac: ܡܪܬܝ‎, Mārt(y)). [CLS] [SEP] The title is placed before the Christian name, as in Mar Aprem/Mor Afrem (Ephrem the Syrian) and Marth/Morth Maryam (Mary, mother of Jesus). [CLS] [SEP] The variant Maran or Moran (Syriac: ܡܪܢ‎, Māran), meaning "Our Lord", is a particular title given to Jesus, either alone or in combination with other names and titles. [CLS] [SEP] Likewise, Martan or Mortan (Syriac: ܡܪܬܢ‎, Mārtan, "Our Lady") is a title of Mary, mother of Jesus. [CLS] [SEP] Occasionally, the term Maran or Moran has been used of various Eastern Christian patriarchs and catholicoi, who started using it in the recent centuries. [CLS] [SEP] The Syriac Orthodox Patriarch of Antioch, the Malankara Orthodox Catholicos use the title Moran Mor. [CLS] [SEP] Sometimes the Indian bearers of this title are called Moran Mar, using a hybrid style from both Syriac dialects that reflects somewhat the history of Syrian Christians in Kerala. [CLS] [SEP] The Pope of Rome is referred to as Mar Papa by the Saint Thomas Christians of India. [CLS] [SEP] The obscure variant Marya or Moryo (Syriac: ܡܪܝܐ‎, Māryā) is used in the Peshitta Old Testament to render the Tetragrammaton. [CLS] [SEP] Although this word is clearly a derived form of the above, there is a fanciful derivation found in early Syriac lexica, that the word is an initialism as follows: ܡ — ܡܪܘܬܐ, māruṯā, 'lordship' ܪ — ܪܒܘܬܐ, rabbuṯā, 'majesty' ܝ ܐ — ܐܝܬܝܐ, iṯyā, 'self-existence'In Mishnaic Hebrew through to date this Aramaic word is pronounced [mar] (Hebrew: מָר‎‎), and it is used as a formal way of addressing or referring to a male person. [CLS] [SEP] In the Gemara, Tabyomi is sometimes referred to as Mar. [CLS] [SEP] "Mar" was also the title of the Exilarch (leader of the Jewish diaspora community in Babylon), with the Aramaic-speaking Jews sharing many cultural attributes with the Syriac Christians. [CLS] [SEP] In the Modern Hebrew of contemporary Israel, "Mar" is used without distinction for any male person, like "Mr." in English. [CLS] [SEP] However, in Rabbanical circles of Jews from the Middle East, the Aramaic variant form מָרָן (Maran, Aramaic: our lord) is still a title to used for highly appreciated Rabbis, such as Ovadia Yosef, the spiritual leader of the Shas party.
