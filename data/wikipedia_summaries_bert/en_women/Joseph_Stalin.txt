Joseph Vissarionovich Stalin (born Ioseb Besarionis dzе Jugashvili; 18 December [O.S. [CLS] [SEP] 6 December] 1878 – 5 March 1953) was a Georgian revolutionary and Soviet politician who ruled the Soviet Union from the mid-1920s until his death in 1953. [CLS] [SEP] He served as the general secretary of the Communist Party of the Soviet Union (1922–1952) and premier of the Soviet Union (1941–1953). [CLS] [SEP] Despite initially governing the Soviet Union as part of a collective leadership, he eventually consolidated power to become the country's de facto dictator by the 1930s. [CLS] [SEP] A communist ideologically committed to the Leninist interpretation of Marxism, Stalin formalised these ideas as Marxism–Leninism, while his own policies are known as Stalinism. [CLS] [SEP] Born to a poor family in Gori in the Russian Empire (now Georgia), Stalin joined the Marxist Russian Social Democratic Labour Party as a youth. [CLS] [SEP] He edited the party's newspaper, Pravda, and raised funds for Vladimir Lenin's Bolshevik faction via robberies, kidnappings, and protection rackets. [CLS] [SEP] Repeatedly arrested, he underwent several internal exiles. [CLS] [SEP] After the Bolsheviks seized power during the 1917 October Revolution and created a one-party state under Lenin's newly renamed Communist Party, Stalin joined its governing Politburo. [CLS] [SEP] Serving in the Russian Civil War before overseeing the Soviet Union's establishment in 1922, Stalin assumed leadership over the country following Lenin's 1924 death. [CLS] [SEP] Under Stalin, "socialism in one country" became a central tenet of the party's dogma. [CLS] [SEP] Through the Five-Year Plans, the country underwent agricultural collectivisation and rapid industrialisation, creating a centralised command economy. [CLS] [SEP] This led to significant disruptions in food production that contributed to the famine of 1932–33. [CLS] [SEP] To eradicate accused "enemies of the working class", Stalin instituted the "Great Purge", in which over a million were imprisoned and at least 700,000 executed between 1934 and 1939. [CLS] [SEP] By 1937, he had complete personal control over the party and state. [CLS] [SEP] Stalin's government promoted Marxism–Leninism abroad through the Communist International and supported European anti-fascist movements during the 1930s, particularly in the Spanish Civil War. [CLS] [SEP] In 1939, it signed a non-aggression pact with Nazi Germany, resulting in the Soviet invasion of Poland. [CLS] [SEP] Germany ended the pact by invading the Soviet Union in 1941. [CLS] [SEP] Despite initial setbacks, the Soviet Red Army repelled the German incursion and captured Berlin in 1945, ending World War II in Europe. [CLS] [SEP] The Soviets annexed the Baltic states and helped establish Soviet-aligned governments throughout Central and Eastern Europe, China, and North Korea. [CLS] [SEP] The Soviet Union and the United States emerged from the war as global superpowers. [CLS] [SEP] Tensions arose between the Soviet-backed Eastern Bloc and U.S.-backed Western Bloc which became known as the Cold War. [CLS] [SEP] Stalin led his country through the post-war reconstruction, during which it developed a nuclear weapon in 1949. [CLS] [SEP] In these years, the country experienced another major famine and an antisemitic campaign peaking in the doctors' plot. [CLS] [SEP] After Stalin's death in 1953, he was eventually succeeded by Nikita Khrushchev, who denounced him and initiated the de-Stalinisation of Soviet society. [CLS] [SEP] Widely considered one of the 20th century's most significant figures, Stalin was the subject of a pervasive personality cult within the international Marxist–Leninist movement, which revered him as a champion of the working class and socialism. [CLS] [SEP] Since the dissolution of the Soviet Union in 1991, Stalin has retained popularity in Russia and Georgia as a victorious wartime leader who established the Soviet Union as a major world power. [CLS] [SEP] Conversely, his totalitarian government has been widely condemned for overseeing mass repressions, ethnic cleansing, deportations, hundreds of thousands of executions, and famines that killed millions.
