[CLS] Hurricane Diane was the costliest Atlantic hurricane of its time, causing $813.7 million in damage. [SEP] [CLS] The inclusion of loss of business and personal revenue increased the total to over $1 billion. [SEP] [CLS] One of three hurricanes to hit North Carolina during the 1955 Atlantic hurricane season, it formed on August 7 from a tropical wave between the Lesser Antilles and Cape Verde. [SEP] [CLS] Diane initially moved west-northwestward with little change in its intensity, but began to strengthen rapidly after turning to the north-northeast. [SEP] [CLS] On August 12, the hurricane reached peak sustained winds of 105 mph (165 km/h), making it a Category 2 hurricane. [SEP] [CLS] Gradually weakening after veering back west, Diane made landfall near Wilmington, North Carolina, as a strong tropical storm on August 17, just five days after Hurricane Connie struck near the same area. [SEP] [CLS] Diane weakened further after moving inland, at which point the United States Weather Bureau noted a decreased threat of further destruction. [SEP] [CLS] The storm turned to the northeast, and warm waters from the Atlantic Ocean helped produce record rainfall across the northeastern United States. [SEP] [CLS] On August 19, Diane emerged into the Atlantic Ocean southeast of New York City, becoming extratropical two days later and completely dissipating by August 23. [SEP] [CLS] The first area affected by Diane was North Carolina, which suffered coastal flooding but little wind and rain damage. [SEP] [CLS] After the storm weakened in Virginia, it maintained an area of moisture that resulted in heavy rainfall after interacting with the Blue Ridge Mountains, a process known as orographic lift. [SEP] [CLS] Flooding affected roads and low-lying areas along the Potomac River. [SEP] [CLS] The northernmost portion of Delaware also saw freshwater flooding, although to a much lesser extent than adjacent states. [SEP] [CLS] Diane produced heavy rainfall in eastern Pennsylvania, causing the worst floods on record there, largely in the Poconos and along the Delaware River. [SEP] [CLS] Rushing waters demolished about 150 road and rail bridges and breached or destroyed 30 dams. [SEP] [CLS] The swollen Brodhead Creek virtually submerged a summer camp, killing 37 people. [SEP] [CLS] Throughout Pennsylvania, the disaster killed 101 people and caused an estimated $70 million in damage (1955 USD). [SEP] [CLS] Additional flooding spread through the northwest portion of neighboring New Jersey, forcing hundreds of people to evacuate and destroying several bridges, including one built in 1831. [SEP] [CLS] Storm damage was evident but less significant in southeastern New York. [SEP] [CLS] Damage from Diane was heaviest in Connecticut, where rainfall peaked at 16.86 in (428 mm) near Torrington. [SEP] [CLS] The storm produced the state's largest flood on record, which effectively split the state into two by destroying bridges and cutting communications. [SEP] [CLS] All major streams and valleys were flooded, and 30 stream gauges reported their highest levels on record. [SEP] [CLS] The Connecticut River at Hartford reached a water level of 30.6 ft (9.3 m), the third highest on record there. [SEP] [CLS] The flooding destroyed a large section of downtown Winsted, much of which was never rebuilt. [SEP] [CLS] Record-high tides and flooded rivers heavily damaged Woonsocket, Rhode Island. [SEP] [CLS] In Massachusetts, flood water levels surpassed those during the 1938 Long Island hurricane, breaching multiple dams and inundating adjacent towns and roads. [SEP] [CLS] Throughout New England, 206 dams were damaged or destroyed, and about 7,000 people were injured. [SEP] [CLS] Nationwide, Diane killed at least 184 people and destroyed 813 houses, with another 14,000 homes heavily damaged. [SEP] [CLS] In the hurricane's wake, eight states were declared federal disaster areas, and the name Diane was retired. [SEP] [CLS]
