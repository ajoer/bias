Hurricane Keith was an Atlantic hurricane in October 2000 that caused extensive damage in Central America, especially in Mexico and Belize. [CLS] [SEP] It was the fifteenth tropical cyclone, eleventh named storm, and seventh hurricane of the 2000 Atlantic hurricane season. [CLS] [SEP] Keith developed as a tropical depression from a tropical wave in the western Caribbean Sea on September 28. [CLS] [SEP] The depression gradually strengthened, and became Tropical Storm Keith on the following day. [CLS] [SEP] As the storm tracked westward, it continued to intensify and was upgraded to a hurricane on September 30. [CLS] [SEP] Shortly thereafter, Keith began to rapidly deepen, and peaked as a Category 4 hurricane less than 24 hours later. [CLS] [SEP] Keith then began to meander erratically offshore of Belize, which significantly weakened the storm due to land interaction. [CLS] [SEP] By late on October 2, Keith made landfall in Ambergris Caye, Belize as a minimal hurricane. [CLS] [SEP] It quickly weakened to a tropical storm, before another landfall occurred near Belize City early on the following day. [CLS] [SEP] While moving inland over the Yucatán Peninsula, Keith weakened further, and was downgraded to a tropical depression before emerging into the Gulf of Mexico on October 4. [CLS] [SEP] Once in the Gulf of Mexico, Keith began to re-strengthen and was upgraded to a tropical storm later that day, and a hurricane on the following day. [CLS] [SEP] By late on October 5, Keith made its third and final landfall near Tampico, Tamaulipas, Mexico as a moderately strong Category 1 hurricane. [CLS] [SEP] The storm quickly weakened inland and dissipated as a tropical cyclone by 24 hours after landfall. [CLS] [SEP] Keith brought heavy rainfall to several countries in Central America, which resulted in extensive flooding, especially in Belize and Mexico. [CLS] [SEP] In Guatemala, the storm flooded 10 towns, and caused one fatality. [CLS] [SEP] Similarly, one fatality also occurred in El Salvador, and at least 300 people were affected by flooding in that country. [CLS] [SEP] Thirteen communities in Nicaragua were completely isolated after Keith made roads impassable. [CLS] [SEP] Twelve deaths were reported in Nicaragua, all of which were flood-related. [CLS] [SEP] Five people were presumed dead in Honduras after an aircraft disappeared near Roatán; one other fatality occurred due to flooding. [CLS] [SEP] The storm brought torrential rainfall to Belize, with many areas reporting at least 10 inches (250 mm) of rain, while highest reported amount of precipitation was greater than 30 inches (760 mm). [CLS] [SEP] In Belize, a village reported that only 12 houses remained, while elsewhere in the country, at least 60 homes were destroyed or damaged; several houses in Belize City suffered minor roof damage. [CLS] [SEP] At least 19 people were killed in Belize and damages totaled to $280 million (2000 USD). [CLS] [SEP] Heavy rainfall also occurred in Mexico, especially in the states of Nuevo León and Tamaulipas. [CLS] [SEP] Flooding from Keith caused several mudslides and a few rivers reached historic levels. [CLS] [SEP] Throughout Mexico, at least 460 houses were damaged or destroyed and other losses in infrastructure occurred. [CLS] [SEP] In addition, one person drowned due to heavy rainfall. [CLS] [SEP] Damages incurred in associated with Keith in Mexico totaled to approximately $365.9 million (2000 MXN, $38.7 million 2000 USD). [CLS] [SEP] Overall, Keith was responsible for 68 deaths and $319 million (2000 USD) in damage. [CLS] [SEP]
