Hurricane Joaquin (Spanish: [xwaËˆkin], wah-KEEN) was a powerful tropical cyclone that devastated several districts of the Bahamas and caused damage in the Turks and Caicos Islands, parts of the Greater Antilles, and Bermuda. [CLS] [SEP] It was also the strongest Atlantic hurricane of non-tropical origin recorded in the satellite era. [CLS] [SEP] The tenth named storm, third hurricane, and second major hurricane of the 2015 Atlantic hurricane season, Joaquin evolved from a non-tropical low to become a tropical depression on September 28, well southwest of Bermuda. [CLS] [SEP] Tempered by unfavorable wind shear, the depression drifted southwestward. [CLS] [SEP] After becoming a tropical storm the next day, Joaquin underwent rapid intensification, reaching hurricane status on September 30 and Category 4 major hurricane strength on October 1. [CLS] [SEP] Meandering over the southern Bahamas, Joaquin's eye passed near or over several islands. [CLS] [SEP] On October 3, the hurricane weakened somewhat and accelerated to the northeast. [CLS] [SEP] Abrupt re-intensification ensued later that day, and Joaquin acquired sustained winds of 155 mph (250 km/h), just short of Category 5 strength. [CLS] [SEP] Hurricane warnings were hoisted across most of the Bahamas as the hurricane threatened the country. [CLS] [SEP] Battering the nation's southern islands for over two days, Joaquin caused extensive devastation, most notably on Acklins, Crooked Island, Long Island, Rum Cay, and San Salvador Island. [CLS] [SEP] Severe storm surge inundated many communities, trapping hundreds of people in their homes; flooding persisted for days after the hurricane's departure. [CLS] [SEP] Prolonged, intense winds brought down trees and powerlines, and unroofed homes throughout the affected region. [CLS] [SEP] As airstrips were submerged and heavily damaged, relief workers were limited in their ability to quickly help residents affected by Joaquin, one of the strongest storms on record to affect the nation. [CLS] [SEP] Offshore, the American cargo ship El Faro and her 33 members were lost to the hurricane. [CLS] [SEP] Coastal flooding also impacted the nearby Turks and Caicos, washing out roadways, compromising seawalls, and damaging homes. [CLS] [SEP] Strong winds and heavy rainfall caused some property damage in eastern Cuba. [CLS] [SEP] One fisherman died when heavy seas capsized a small boat along the coast of Haiti. [CLS] [SEP] Storm tides resulted in severe flooding in several departments of Haiti, forcing families from their homes and destroying crops. [CLS] [SEP] The weakening hurricane passed just west of Bermuda on October 4, attended by strong winds that cut power to 15,000 electric subscribers but caused only minor damage otherwise. [CLS] [SEP] After passing near Bermuda, Joaquin ultimately curved northeastward and accelerated, weakening further and becoming extratropical as it entered colder waters. [CLS] [SEP] After dissipating, its remnants traveled eastward, reaching Portugal before being absorbed by a frontal system. [CLS] [SEP] Collectively, Joaquin killed 34 people and caused US$200 million in damages. [CLS] [SEP] With all 34 deaths attributed to the storm occurring at sea, Joaquin has the highest offshore death toll for any Atlantic hurricane since the Escuminac hurricane in 1959, which killed 35 people in the Northumberland Strait.Although Joaquin never directly affected the United States, another large storm system over the southeastern states drew tremendous moisture from the hurricane, resulting in catastrophic flooding in South Carolina.
