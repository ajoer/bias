The 2018 Atlantic hurricane season was the third in a consecutive series of above-average and damaging Atlantic hurricane seasons, featuring 15 named storms, 8 hurricanes, and 2 major hurricanes, which caused a total of over $50 billion (2018 USD) in damages and at least 172 deaths. [CLS] [SEP] The season officially began on June 1, 2018, and ended on November 30, 2018. [CLS] [SEP] These dates historically describe the period each year when most tropical cyclones form in the Atlantic basin and are adopted by convention. [CLS] [SEP] However, the formation of Tropical Storm Alberto on May 25 marked the fourth consecutive year in which a storm developed before the official start of the season. [CLS] [SEP] The season concluded with Oscar transitioning into an extratropical cyclone on October 31, almost a month before the official end. [CLS] [SEP] Although several tropical cyclones impacted land, only a few left extensive damage. [CLS] [SEP] In mid-September, Hurricane Florence produced disastrous flooding in North Carolina and South Carolina, with damage totaling about $24 billion. [CLS] [SEP] The storm also caused 54 deaths. [CLS] [SEP] About a month later, Hurricane Michael, the first tropical cyclone to strike the United States as a Category 5 hurricane since Hurricane Andrew in 1992, left extensive damage in Florida, Georgia, and Alabama. [CLS] [SEP] Michael caused approximately $25 billion in damage and at least 64 deaths. [CLS] [SEP] Since Michael reached Category 5 status, 2018 became the third consecutive season to feature at least one Category 5 hurricane. [CLS] [SEP] Hurricane Leslie resulted in the first tropical storm warning being issued for the Madeira region of Portugal. [CLS] [SEP] Leslie and its remnants left hundreds of thousands of power outages and downed at least 1,000 trees in the Portuguese mainland, while heavy rains generated by the remains of the cyclone caused 15 deaths in France. [CLS] [SEP] The storm left approximately $500 million in damage and 16 fatalities. [CLS] [SEP] Most forecasting groups called for a below-average season due to cooler than normal sea surface temperatures in the tropical Atlantic and the anticipated development of an El Niño. [CLS] [SEP] However, the anticipated El Niño failed to develop in time to suppress activity, and activity exceeded most predictions. [CLS] [SEP]
