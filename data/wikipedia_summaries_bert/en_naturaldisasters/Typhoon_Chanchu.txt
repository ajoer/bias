Typhoon Chanchu, known in the Philippines as Typhoon Caloy, was the most intense typhoon in the South China Sea in the month of May according to the Hong Kong Observatory (HKO). [CLS] [SEP] The first named storm of the 2006 Pacific typhoon season, Chanchu formed on May 8 in the vicinity of the Federated States of Micronesia and progressed westward. [CLS] [SEP] It gradually intensified into a tropical storm and later severe tropical storm before moving through the Philippines. [CLS] [SEP] On May 13, Chanchu entered the South China Sea and became a typhoon, according to the Japan Meteorological Agency (JMA). [CLS] [SEP] Warm waters and favorable outflow allowed the storm to quickly intensify to peak maximum sustained winds of 175 km/h (110 mph) on May 15. [CLS] [SEP] Around that time, the typhoon turned sharply to the north toward southeastern China. [CLS] [SEP] Chanchu weakened as it curved to the northeast, making landfall near Shantou, Guangdong on May 17 as a severe tropical storm. [CLS] [SEP] The government of China considered Chanchu the earliest typhoon to make landfall in the province. [CLS] [SEP] On the next day, the storm emerged into the East China Sea, becoming extratropical on May 19 before dissipating west of Kyushu. [CLS] [SEP] Early in its duration, Chanchu moved through the Philippines, causing power outages and landslides in several islands. [CLS] [SEP] Despite a general warning against small boats sailing, a ferry departed Masbate and capsized due to the storm, killing 28 people. [CLS] [SEP] Throughout the country, 41 people died, and damage reached ₱117.57 million (PHP, US$2.15 million). [CLS] [SEP] While in the South China Sea, Chanchu caught many Vietnamese fisherman off guard, causing 17 ships to sink and damaging several others. [CLS] [SEP] Chinese ships assisted in the search-and-rescue mission, ultimately rescuing 330 fishermen from 22 boats; however, 21 bodies were found, and the remaining 220 missing were presumed killed. [CLS] [SEP] In southern China, flooding and strong winds from Chanchu wrecked about 14,000 houses and damaged over 190,000 ha (470,000 acres) of crop fields. [CLS] [SEP] Damage was heaviest in Shantou where it moved ashore, with flooding covering roads and entering hundreds of homes. [CLS] [SEP] Damage in China totaled ¥7 billion yuan (RMB, US$872 million), and there were 23 deaths. [CLS] [SEP] Rains from the typhoon killed two people in Taiwan after sweeping them up in a river, and crop damage there reached NT$158.88 million (NTD, US$5 million). [CLS] [SEP] Later, high waves killed one person in Okinawa and left another person missing, while rains extended into South Korea. [CLS] [SEP]
