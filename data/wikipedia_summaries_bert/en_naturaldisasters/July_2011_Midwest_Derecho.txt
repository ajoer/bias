[CLS] The July 2011 Iowa-Illinois-Michigan-Ohio Derecho was a derecho event that occurred on July 11, 2011 in the states of Iowa, Illinois, Michigan, and Ohio. [SEP] [CLS] On the morning of July 11, 2011, a powerful long-lasting straight-line windstorm, known as a derecho, developed over central Iowa and carved a path of extensive damage across east central Iowa. [SEP] [CLS] The storm first took shape as a cluster of low end severe storms over southern Nebraska during the late afternoon of July 10. [SEP] [CLS] The system continued northeastward and entered western Iowa at 1:00am, still only as a marginal line of severe storms. [SEP] [CLS] As the system passed through the northern Des Moines metro area at 3:30am, it interacted with an outflow boundary from the storms to the north and rapidly intensified as it accelerated eastward. [SEP] [CLS] Over the next hour and a half the storm plowed eastward through Story, Marshall, and Tama Counties, blasting the area with winds of up to 105 mph. [SEP] [CLS] The storm continued to track eastward, plowing through eastern Iowa and the southern Great Lakes region before dissipating in West Virginia in the mid-afternoon. [SEP] [CLS] Thousands of trees were downed in western Iowa alone, and numerous structures were either damaged or destroyed. [SEP] [CLS] The peak winds were estimated to be in the range of 130 miles per hour (210 km/h), equal to a Category 4 hurricane on the Saffir-Simpson hurricane scale Shortly after this complex, a major heat wave would affect the eastern half of the continent, with another significant derecho event occurring on July 17, 2011 over Ontario, Quebec and northern New England.
