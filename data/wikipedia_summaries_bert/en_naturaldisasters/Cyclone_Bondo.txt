Intense Tropical Cyclone Bondo was the first of a series of six tropical cyclones to impact Madagascar during the 2006–07 South-West Indian Ocean cyclone season. [CLS] [SEP] Bondo developed on December 15 in the central Indian Ocean, west of Diego Garcia. [CLS] [SEP] After strengthening into a moderate tropical storm on December 18, the storm rapidly intensified while moving westward, taking advantage of favorable atmospheric conditions. [CLS] [SEP] Within 18 hours of being named, Bondo intensified to tropical cyclone status, or the equivalent of a minimal hurricane. [CLS] [SEP] The Météo-France office on Réunion (MFR) estimated peak 10 minute sustained winds of 205 km/h (125 mph), although the American-based Joint Typhoon Warning Center estimated stronger 1 minute winds of 250 km/h (155 mph). [CLS] [SEP] While near peak intensity, Bondo passed just south of Agaléga island, before weakening slightly and moving through the Farquhar Group of islands belonging to the Seychelles, becoming the strongest cyclone to affect that island group in decades. [CLS] [SEP] Bondo turned southwestward, and after brushing the northern coast of Madagascar, the cyclone made landfall near Mahajanga on December 25. [CLS] [SEP] The storm continued southward, and was last tracked by the MFR on December 28. [CLS] [SEP] Due to its small size, Bondo's winds did not exceed 100 km/h (62 mph) on Agaléga, despite passing close by near peak intensity. [CLS] [SEP] In the Seychelles, Bondo severely damaged buildings and vegetation on Providence Atoll. [CLS] [SEP] High waves caused flooding elsewhere in the archipelago. [CLS] [SEP] In Madagascar, Bondo killed 11 people when it struck the island's west coast. [CLS] [SEP] The storm's high winds, reaching 155 km/h (96 mph) in Mahajanga, damaged buildings and left around 20,000 people homeless. [CLS] [SEP]
