[CLS] The 1846 Havana hurricane (also known as the Great Havana hurricane of 1846, San Francisco de Borja hurricane and The Great Gale of 1846) was the most intense tropical cyclone in recorded history for 78 years and the first known Category 5-strength hurricane to strike Cuba. [SEP] [CLS] The first indications of the formation of a disturbance were first noted on 5 October in the Caribbean Sea, but little else was known until the storm approached Cuba on 10 October. [SEP] [CLS] There, it brought extreme winds and the lowest known atmospheric pressure of the time – 938 mbar (27.70 inHg) – a record which remained unbroken until the development of a later cyclone in 1924. [SEP] [CLS] It soon curved toward Florida, where it maintained its intensity, continuing to rapidly hasten northward along the East Coast of the United States to New England. [SEP] [CLS] It entered an extratropical transition while situated over New York on 13 October, producing intense Category 2-force winds and unusually little precipitation. [SEP] [CLS] Eventually, the gale dissipated over the Canadian Maritimes the following day as a markedly weaker storm. [SEP] [CLS] In Cuba, the storm caused hundreds of deaths, capsized dozens of ships, obliterated buildings, uprooted trees, and ruined crops. [SEP] [CLS] Many towns were wholly destroyed or flattened and never recovered, while others disappeared entirely. [SEP] [CLS] Damage in the United States was considerably better-chronicled despite being less severe. [SEP] [CLS] In Key West, widespread destruction was noted, with 40 deaths, many vessels rendered unfit, and widespread structural damage, with several buildings swept off of their foundations and hundreds of others flattened. [SEP] [CLS] Few supplies arrived in the following days and relief efforts were gradual, with few resources within the town's vicinity. [SEP] [CLS] Along other sections of the Southeastern U.S. [SEP] [CLS] coast, copious rainfall and moderate winds impacted agriculture, shipping, and residences. [SEP] [CLS] As the storm tracked along the Middle-Atlantic coast, similar effects were reported: there, the gale inundated many areas, impeded communications, destroyed railroads and canals, and flattened structures. [SEP] [CLS] Despite extensive damage, only two deaths were recorded outside Cuba and Florida. [SEP] [CLS] Along its entire track, the hurricane caused $338,000 in losses and at least 164 deaths.Unusual in many aspects, the 1846 Havana hurricane was the most intense of its time. [SEP] [CLS] Though atmospheric pressure readings in Cuba reached as low as 916 mbar (27.06 inHg), the meteorological historian Jose Fernandez-Partagás re-evaluated several possible pressure records, concluding that the cyclone's minimum pressure was likely closer to 938 mbar (27.70 inHg); even so, it maintained the title of having the lowest recorded pressure measurement until 1924, 78 years later. [SEP] [CLS] Although no reliable wind measurements were available at the time, a separate study also estimated that it produced Category 5-strength winds, making it the first known storm to strike Cuba at such an intensity. [SEP] [CLS] As a result of the tropical cyclone's extreme intensity, ecological and geographical features were permanently altered in many areas. [SEP] [CLS] Sand Key, which completely submerged during the course of the hurricane, wholly re-emerged by December of that year, albeit not in its original position; meanwhile, ecological damage remained evident for decades in Key West.
