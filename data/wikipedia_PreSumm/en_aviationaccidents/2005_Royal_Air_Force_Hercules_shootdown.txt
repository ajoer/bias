[CLS] The 2005 Royal Air Force Hercules shootdown was the loss of a Royal Air Force Lockheed C-130K Hercules C3, serial number XV179, callsign Hilton 22, when it was shot down in Iraq, probably by Sunni insurgents, on 30 January 2005, killing all 10 personnel on board. [SEP] [CLS] At the time, the incident was the largest single loss of life suffered by the British military during Operation Telic. [SEP] [CLS] The Board of Inquiry report in December 2005 identified the lack of a fire-suppressant system as a contributory factor. [SEP] [CLS] In September 2006, the British Channel 4 News aired an article criticising the Ministry of Defence for having fitted only one C-130 Hercules with a foam fire-suppressant system. [SEP] [CLS] The RAF had ordered a retrofit of this system to all front-line C130 aircraft, a system which could well have prevented the loss of aircraft XV179 and its crew. [SEP] [CLS]
