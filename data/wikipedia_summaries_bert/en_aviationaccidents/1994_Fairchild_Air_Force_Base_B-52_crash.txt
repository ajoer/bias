On Friday, 24 June 1994, a United States Air Force (USAF) Boeing B-52 Stratofortress crashed at Fairchild Air Force Base, Washington, United States, after its pilot, Lieutenant Colonel Arthur "Bud" Holland, maneuvered the bomber beyond its operational limits and lost control. [CLS] [SEP] The B-52 stalled, fell to the ground and exploded, killing Holland and the three other field-grade officers on board the aircraft. [CLS] [SEP] In addition, one person on the ground suffered injuries during the accident, but survived. [CLS] [SEP] The crash was captured on video and was shown repeatedly on news broadcasts throughout the world.The subsequent investigation concluded that the crash was attributable primarily to three factors: Holland's personality and behavior; USAF leaders' delayed or inadequate reactions to earlier incidents involving Holland; and the sequence of events during the aircraft's final flight. [CLS] [SEP] The crash is now used in military and civilian aviation environments as a case study in teaching crew resource management. [CLS] [SEP] It is also often used by the U.S. [CLS] [SEP] Armed Forces during aviation safety training as an example of the importance of complying with safety regulations and correcting the behavior of anyone who violates safety procedures.
