[CLS] Tropical Storm Emily was a rapidly-forming tropical cyclone that made landfall on the west coast of Florida. [SEP] [CLS] The fifth named storm of the 2017 Atlantic hurricane season, Emily formed from a small area of low pressure that developed along a cold front in late July 2017. [SEP] [CLS] Unexpectedly, the low rapidly organized and strengthened into a tropical depression on July 30, and then into a tropical storm early the next day. [SEP] [CLS] Emily continued to intensify as it moved eastward, peaking with maximum sustained winds of 60 mph (95 km/h) as it made landfall near Longboat Key on the western Florida coast. [SEP] [CLS] The cyclone weakened quickly into a tropical depression shortly after landfall as its circulation became increasingly disrupted. [SEP] [CLS] Emerging into the Atlantic Ocean on August 1, Emily continued to weaken as it accelerated northeastward, becoming post-tropical early on August 2. [SEP] [CLS] Heavy rainfall produced by Emily caused widespread flooding in southwest Florida, causing road closures and water damage to homes and buildings. [SEP] [CLS] An EF0 tornado spawned by the storm destroyed two barns and numerous greenhouses, as well as causing an engineered wall to collapse. [SEP] [CLS] Overall damages are estimated at $10 million (USD). [SEP] [CLS]
