[CLS] Emperor Zhi of Han (simplified Chinese: 漢质帝; traditional Chinese: 漢質帝;; pinyin: Hàn Zhì Dì; Wade–Giles: Han Chih-ti; 138 – 26 July 146) was an emperor of the Chinese Han Dynasty. [SEP] [CLS] He was a great-great-grandson of Emperor Zhang. [SEP] [CLS] His reign was dominated by Liang Ji, the brother of Empress Dowager Liang, who eventually poisoned the young emperor. [SEP] [CLS] Emperor Zhi ascended the throne when he was seven when his third cousin, two-year-old Emperor Chong died, and although he was still a child, Emperor Zhi was remarkably intelligent and he knew and was offended by the immense power Liang Ji had over the government—leading to him once commenting that Liang Ji was "an arrogant general." This act of defiance angered Liang Ji, who proceeded to poison the emperor. [SEP] [CLS] Emperor Zhi was only eight when he died. [SEP] [CLS]
