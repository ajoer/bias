[CLS] The 1966 Hualien earthquake occurred on March 13 at 00:31 local time of Taiwan. [SEP] [CLS] The epicenter was located in the offshore area between Yonaguni Island, Japan and Hualien, Taiwan. [SEP] [CLS] The intensity in Yonaguni reached shindo 5. [SEP] [CLS] Two people were reported dead in Yonaguni, Japan, and four in Taiwan. [SEP] [CLS] Building damage was reported. [SEP] [CLS] A tsunami with a run-up height of 50 cm (20 in) was observed.This earthquake released a seismic moment of 4.86Ã—1020 Nm. [SEP] [CLS] The magnitude of this earthquake was put at Ms 8.0, Mw 7.79, MJMA 7.8, or ML 7.8. [SEP] [CLS] This earthquake had a strike-slip faulting focal mechanism. [SEP] [CLS] The fault plane solutions of this earthquake suggested that there is a sliver of crust off the east coast of Taiwan other than the Philippine Sea Plate. [SEP] [CLS] The map of shallow earthquakes shows that the Philippines are encircled by a zone of seismicity. [SEP] [CLS] There is a difference between the slip direction in the east coast of the Philippines and the relative motion between the Philippine Sea Plate and the Eurasian Plate. [SEP] [CLS] Together with other evidences, it has been suggested that most of the Philippines might belong to a minor plate other than the Eurasian Plate. [SEP] [CLS]
