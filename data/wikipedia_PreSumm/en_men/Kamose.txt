[CLS] Kamose was the last king of the Theban Seventeenth Dynasty. [SEP] [CLS] He was possibly the son of Seqenenre Tao and Ahhotep I and the full brother of Ahmose I, founder of the Eighteenth Dynasty. [SEP] [CLS] His reign fell at the very end of the Second Intermediate Period. [SEP] [CLS] Kamose is usually ascribed a reign of three years (his highest attested regnal year), although some scholars now favor giving him a longer reign of approximately five years.His reign is important for the decisive military initiatives he took against the Hyksos, who had come to rule much of Ancient Egypt. [SEP] [CLS] His father had begun the initiatives and, quite possibly, lost his life in battle with the Hyksos. [SEP] [CLS] It is thought that his mother, as regent, continued the campaigns after the death of Kamose and that his full brother made the final conquest of them and united all of Egypt.
