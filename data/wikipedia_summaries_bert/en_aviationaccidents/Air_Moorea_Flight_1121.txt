[CLS] Air Moorea Flight 1121 was a de Havilland Canada DHC-6 Twin Otter which crashed shortly after takeoff from Moorea Airport on Moorea Island in French Polynesia on 9 August 2007, killing all 20 people on board. [SEP] [CLS] It was bound for Tahiti's Fa'a'ā International Airport on a regular 7-minute service, one of the shortest on earth, scheduled 40 to 50 times a day. [SEP] [CLS] Frequent takeoff and landing are believed to have been a major factor in the crash, because of wear and tear on the elevator cables, inspected only at fixed time intervals, regardless of usage. [SEP] [CLS] Another factor may have been jet-blast from large planes pushing back from the ramp at Fa'a'ā International. [SEP] [CLS]
