[CLS] The October 2015 North American storm complex was an extratropical storm that triggered a high precipitation event, which caused historic flash flooding across North and South Carolina. [SEP] [CLS] The incipient cold front traversed the Eastern United States on September 29â€“30, producing heavy rain in multiple states. [SEP] [CLS] The system subsequently stalled just offshore. [SEP] [CLS] Tapping into moisture from the nearby Hurricane Joaquin, a developing surface low brought heavy, continuous rain to southeastern States, with the worst effects concentrated in South Carolina where catastrophic flooding occurred. [SEP] [CLS] The event culminated in South Carolina on October 4 when numerous rivers burst their banks, washing away roads, bridges, vehicles, and homes. [SEP] [CLS] Hundreds of people required rescue and the state's emergency management department urged everyone in the state not to travel. [SEP] [CLS] Some areas of the state saw rainfall equivalent to a 1-in-1000-year event. [SEP] [CLS] At least 25 deaths have been attributed to the weather complex: 19 in South Carolina, 2 in New York, 2 in North Carolina, 1 in Florida, and 1 in New Brunswick.
