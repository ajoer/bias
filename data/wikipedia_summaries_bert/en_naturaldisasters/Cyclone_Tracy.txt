Cyclone Tracy was a tropical cyclone that devastated the city of Darwin, Northern Territory, Australia from 24 to 26 December 1974. [CLS] [SEP] The small, developing easterly storm had been observed passing clear of the city initially, but then turned towards it early on 24 December. [CLS] [SEP] After 10:00 p.m. [CLS] [SEP] ACST, damage became severe, and wind gusts reached 217 kilometres per hour (134.84 mph) before instruments failed. [CLS] [SEP] Residents of Darwin were celebrating Christmas, and did not immediately acknowledge the emergency, partly because they had been alerted to an earlier cyclone (Selma) that passed west of the city. [CLS] [SEP] Additionally, news outlets had only a skeleton crew on duty over the holiday. [CLS] [SEP] Tracy killed 71 people, caused A$837 million in damage (1974 dollars), or approximately A$6.85 billion (2018 dollars), or $4.79 billion 2018 USD. [CLS] [SEP] It destroyed more than 70 percent of Darwin's buildings, including 80 percent of houses. [CLS] [SEP] It left more than 25,000 out of the 47,000 inhabitants of the city homeless prior to landfall and required the evacuation of over 30,000 people, of whom many never returned. [CLS] [SEP] After the storm passed, the city was rebuilt using more stringent standards "to cyclone code". [CLS] [SEP] The storm was the second-smallest tropical cyclone on record (in terms of gale-force wind diameter), behind only Tropical Storm Marco in 2008. [CLS] [SEP]
