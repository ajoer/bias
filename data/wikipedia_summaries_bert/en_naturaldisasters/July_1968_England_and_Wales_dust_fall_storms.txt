The July 1968 United Kingdom thunderstorms were the most severe dust fall thunderstorms in the British Isles for over 200 years. [CLS] [SEP] A layer of mineral dust blowing north from the Sahara met cold, wet air over the British Isles, resulting in thick, dense clouds and severe thunderstorms across most of England and Wales. [CLS] [SEP] These clouds completely blotted out the light in some areas and the rain and hail resulted in property damage and flooding, and at least four people were killed. [CLS] [SEP] During the storm, Leeming Bar in North Yorkshire saw 35.7 millimetres (1.41 in) of rain in under 10 minutes â€“ a UK record until 2003. [CLS] [SEP]
