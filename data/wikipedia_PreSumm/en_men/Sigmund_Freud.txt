[CLS] Sigmund Freud ( FROYD; German: [ˈziːkmʊnt ˈfʁɔʏt]; born Sigismund Schlomo Freud; 6 May 1856 – 23 September 1939) was an Austrian neurologist and the founder of psychoanalysis, a clinical method for treating psychopathology through dialogue between a patient and a psychoanalyst.Freud was born to Galician Jewish parents in the Moravian town of Freiberg, in the Austrian Empire. [SEP] [CLS] He qualified as a doctor of medicine in 1881 at the University of Vienna. [SEP] [CLS] Upon completing his habilitation in 1885, he was appointed a docent in neuropathology and became an affiliated professor in 1902. [SEP] [CLS] Freud lived and worked in Vienna, having set up his clinical practice there in 1886. [SEP] [CLS] In 1938, Freud left Austria to escape Nazi persecution. [SEP] [CLS] He died in exile in the United Kingdom in 1939. [SEP] [CLS] In founding psychoanalysis, Freud developed therapeutic techniques such as the use of free association and discovered transference, establishing its central role in the analytic process. [SEP] [CLS] Freud's redefinition of sexuality to include its infantile forms led him to formulate the Oedipus complex as the central tenet of psychoanalytical theory. [SEP] [CLS] His analysis of dreams as wish-fulfillments provided him with models for the clinical analysis of symptom formation and the underlying mechanisms of repression. [SEP] [CLS] On this basis Freud elaborated his theory of the unconscious and went on to develop a model of psychic structure comprising id, ego and super-ego. [SEP] [CLS] Freud postulated the existence of libido, a sexualised energy with which mental processes and structures are invested and which generates erotic attachments, and a death drive, the source of compulsive repetition, hate, aggression and neurotic guilt. [SEP] [CLS] In his later works, Freud developed a wide-ranging interpretation and critique of religion and culture. [SEP] [CLS] Though in overall decline as a diagnostic and clinical practice, psychoanalysis remains influential within psychology, psychiatry, and psychotherapy, and across the humanities. [SEP] [CLS] It thus continues to generate extensive and highly contested debate with regard to its therapeutic efficacy, its scientific status, and whether it advances or is detrimental to the feminist cause. [SEP] [CLS] Nonetheless, Freud's work has suffused contemporary Western thought and popular culture. [SEP] [CLS] W. [SEP] [CLS] H. [SEP] [CLS] Auden's 1940 poetic tribute to Freud describes him as having created "a whole climate of opinion / under whom we conduct our different lives."
