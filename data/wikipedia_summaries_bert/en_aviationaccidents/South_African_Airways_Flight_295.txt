[CLS] South African Airways Flight 295 was a commercial flight from Chiang Kai-shek International Airport, Taipei, Taiwan to Jan Smuts International Airport, Johannesburg, South Africa, with a stopover in Plaisance Airport, Plaine Magnien, Mauritius. [SEP] [CLS] On 28 November 1987, the aircraft serving the flight, a Boeing 747 Combi named Helderberg, experienced a catastrophic in-flight fire in the cargo area, broke up in mid-air, and crashed into the Indian Ocean east of Mauritius, killing all 159 people on board. [SEP] [CLS] An extensive salvage operation was mounted to try to recover the black box recorders, one of which was recovered from a depth of 4,900 metres (16,100 ft). [SEP] [CLS] The official inquiry, headed by Judge Cecil Margo, was unable to determine the cause of the fire. [SEP] [CLS] This lack of a conclusion led to conspiracy theories being advanced and a subsequent post-apartheid investigation, in the years following the accident. [SEP] [CLS]
