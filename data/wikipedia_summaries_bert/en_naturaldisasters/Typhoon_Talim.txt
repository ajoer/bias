The 2017 Pacific typhoon season was a below-average season in terms of Accumulated Cyclone Energy and the number of typhoons and super typhoons, and the first and latest since the 1977 season to not produce a Category 5-equivalent typhoon on the Saffir-Simpson scale. [CLS] [SEP] The season produced a total of 27 named storms, 11 typhoons, and only two super typhoons, making it an average season in terms of storm numbers. [CLS] [SEP] It was an event in the annual cycle of tropical cyclone formation, in which tropical cyclones form in the western Pacific Ocean. [CLS] [SEP] The season runs throughout 2017, though most tropical cyclones typically develop between May and October. [CLS] [SEP] The season's first named storm, Muifa, developed on April 25, while the season's last named storm, Tembin, dissipated on December 26. [CLS] [SEP] This season also featured the latest occurrence of the first typhoon of the year since 1998, with Noru reaching this intensity on July 23. [CLS] [SEP] The scope of this article is limited to the Pacific Ocean, to the north of the equator between 100°E and the 180th meridian. [CLS] [SEP] Within the northwestern Pacific Ocean, there are two separate agencies that assign names to tropical cyclones, which can often result in a cyclone having two names. [CLS] [SEP] The Japan Meteorological Agency (JMA) will name a tropical cyclone should it be judged to have 10-minute sustained wind speeds of at least 65 km/h (40 mph) anywhere in the basin. [CLS] [SEP] PAGASA assigns unofficial names to tropical cyclones which move into or form as a tropical depression in their area of responsibility, located between 115°E–135°E and between 5°N–25°N, regardless of whether or not a tropical cyclone has already been given a name by the JMA. [CLS] [SEP] Tropical depressions that are monitored by the United States' Joint Typhoon Warning Center (JTWC) are given a numerical designation with a "W" suffix. [CLS] [SEP]
