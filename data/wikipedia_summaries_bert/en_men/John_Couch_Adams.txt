[CLS] John Couch Adams (; 5 June 1819 – 21 January 1892) was a British mathematician and astronomer. [SEP] [CLS] He was born in Laneast, near Launceston, Cornwall, and died in Cambridge. [SEP] [CLS] His most famous achievement was predicting the existence and position of Neptune, using only mathematics. [SEP] [CLS] The calculations were made to explain discrepancies with Uranus's orbit and the laws of Kepler and Newton. [SEP] [CLS] At the same time, but unknown to each other, the same calculations were made by Urbain Le Verrier. [SEP] [CLS] Le Verrier would send his coordinates to Berlin Observatory astronomer Johann Gottfried Galle, who confirmed the existence of the planet on 23 September 1846, finding it within 1° of Le Verrier's predicted location (there was, and to some extent still is, some controversy over the apportionment of credit for the discovery; see Discovery of Neptune). [SEP] [CLS] Adams was Lowndean Professor in the University of Cambridge from 1859 until his death. [SEP] [CLS] He won the Gold Medal of the Royal Astronomical Society in 1866. [SEP] [CLS] In 1884, he attended the International Meridian Conference as a delegate for Britain. [SEP] [CLS] A crater on the Moon is jointly named after him, Walter Sydney Adams and Charles Hitchcock Adams. [SEP] [CLS] Neptune's outermost known ring and the asteroid 1996 Adams are also named after him. [SEP] [CLS] The Adams Prize, presented by the University of Cambridge, commemorates his prediction of the position of Neptune. [SEP] [CLS] His personal library is held at Cambridge University Library. [SEP] [CLS]
