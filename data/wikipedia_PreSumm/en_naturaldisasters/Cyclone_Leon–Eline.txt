[CLS] Cyclone Leon–Eline was the longest-lived Indian Ocean tropical cyclone on record, traveling over 11,000 km (6,800 mi) during its 29‑day duration. [SEP] [CLS] The cyclone formed on February 1, 2000, in the Australian basin as Tropical Cyclone Leon, and was renamed Eline after crossing 90° E into the South-West Indian Ocean; there, the Météo-France office in Réunion (MFR) tracked the storm's movement and intensity. [SEP] [CLS] Late on February 17, Eline made landfall near Mahanoro, Madagascar, with 10‑minute winds of 165 km/h (103 mph). [SEP] [CLS] The storm rapidly weakened over land, but restrengthened in the Mozambique Channel to reach peak 10‑minute winds of 185 km/h (115 mph), making it an intense tropical cyclone. [SEP] [CLS] On February 22, Eline made landfall about 80 km (50 mi) south of Beira, Mozambique, near peak intensity. [SEP] [CLS] Eline quickly weakened over land as it moved across Southern Africa, finally dissipating over eastern Namibia on February 29. [SEP] [CLS] While moving across much of the Indian Ocean, Eline brought high waves, gusty winds, and rainfall to several islands. [SEP] [CLS] When Eline struck Madagascar, the country was in the midst of a cholera epidemic that killed over 1,000 people. [SEP] [CLS] Eline directly killed at least 64 people in the country. [SEP] [CLS] Tropical Storm Gloria struck Madagascar 13 days later, compounding the damage and making it difficult to discern the individual effects. [SEP] [CLS] Damage from Eline was estimated at $9 million (USD), and collectively the two storms killed 205 people and left another 10,000 homeless. [SEP] [CLS] In the region around Vatomandry where Eline made landfall, 65% of houses were damaged, 90% of crops were lost, and 75% of health facilities were wrecked. [SEP] [CLS] Before Eline's final landfall, Mozambique's worst floods since 1951 had killed about 150 people. [SEP] [CLS] The additional rainfall and flooding from Eline created the country's worst natural disaster in a century, and disrupted ongoing relief efforts. [SEP] [CLS] The combined effects destroyed over 250,000 ha (620,000 acres) of crop fields and killed 40,000 cattle. [SEP] [CLS] The Limpopo River reached 15 km (9.3 mi) wide and 11 m (36 ft) above normal in some areas, which isolated the town of Xai-Xai. [SEP] [CLS] A dam broke along the river, flooding the town of Chokwe in the middle of the night and trapping several unprepared residents; this accounted for nearly half of the death toll. [SEP] [CLS] About 55 people drowned in Sofala Province after rescue helicopters arrived too late to save them. [SEP] [CLS] Around 20,000 people in the capital city of Maputo lost their homes. [SEP] [CLS] In addition to the floods, strong winds blew away many roofs and some entire houses made of mud. [SEP] [CLS] The combined effects of the preceding floods and Eline left about 329,000 people displaced or homeless, killed around 700 people, and caused an estimated $500 million (USD) in damage. [SEP] [CLS] The flooding disrupted much of the economic progress Mozambique had made in the 1990s since the end of its civil war. [SEP] [CLS] Elsewhere in Southern Africa, Eline brought strong winds and heavy rainfall when it crossed into eastern Zimbabwe. [SEP] [CLS] Rivers overflowed their banks in the country, damaging crops and houses while leaving 15,000 people homeless. [SEP] [CLS] The storm killed 12 people in the country. [SEP] [CLS] Flooding from the storm extended southward into Swaziland and South Africa. [SEP] [CLS] In the latter country, Eline dropped 503 mm (19.8 in) of rainfall in Levubu over three days, causing the Limpopo River to reach its highest level in 15 years. [SEP] [CLS] Officials opened dams along the river to prevent structural damage, which caused higher levels along the river to the east. [SEP] [CLS] At least 21 people died in the country, and about 80,000 people were left homeless. [SEP] [CLS] Damage in Limpopo Province alone was estimated at $300 million (USD). [SEP] [CLS] To the north, Eline dropped about 90 mm (3.5 in) of rainfall in southern Malawi, while gusty winds caused a power outage in Blantyre. [SEP] [CLS] Farther west, rainfall rates of 50–100 mm (2.0–3.9 in) were reported in Botswana. [SEP] [CLS]
