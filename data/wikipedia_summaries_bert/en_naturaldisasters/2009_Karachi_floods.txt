The 2009 Karachi floods (Urdu: سيلاب کراچی ‎) in Pakistan's financial centre, Karachi, have killed at least 26 people. [CLS] [SEP] The death toll is expected to rise, and more than 150 people have been injured in a series of related incidents. [CLS] [SEP] The floods are the result of the heaviest rains in the region in thirty years.Hundreds of homes were also damaged. [CLS] [SEP] Those killed either drowned, were electrocuted or died under collapsing roofs.

[CLS] [SEP] Commercial markets were waterlogged and several hundred vehicles were trapped on the city's roads.Most of Karachi had no electricity on the night of 18 July 2009.

[CLS] [SEP] However, the rains began around two weeks later than usual and thus are expected to lead to a 30% reduction in rainfall for the 2009 season. [CLS] [SEP] But then another monsoon system was expected to lash the city which was to generate very heavy rains and the citizens were still recovering from the last monsoon rains which broke the record of 1977 rain in Karachi, which was of 207 millimetres (8.1 in). [CLS] [SEP] However it only dumped 18 millimetres (0.71 in) rain and the system dissipated quickly on 26 July.
