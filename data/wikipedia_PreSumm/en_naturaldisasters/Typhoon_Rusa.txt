[CLS] Typhoon Rusa was the most powerful typhoon to strike South Korea in 43 years. [SEP] [CLS] It was the 21st JTWC tropical depression, the 15th named storm, and the 10th typhoon of the 2002 Pacific typhoon season. [SEP] [CLS] It developed on August 22 from the monsoon trough in the northwestern Pacific Ocean, well to the southeast of Japan. [SEP] [CLS] For several days, Rusa moved to the northwest, eventually intensifying into a powerful typhoon. [SEP] [CLS] On August 26, the storm moved across the Amami Islands of Japan, where Rusa left 20,000 people without power and caused two fatalities. [SEP] [CLS] Across Japan, the typhoon dropped torrential rainfall peaking at 902 mm (35.5 in) in Tokushima Prefecture. [SEP] [CLS] After weakening slightly, Rusa made landfall on Goheung, South Korea with winds of 140 km/h (85 mph 10 minute sustained). [SEP] [CLS] It was able to maintain much of its intensity due to warm air and instability from a nearby cold front. [SEP] [CLS] Rusa weakened while moving through the country, dropping heavy rainfall that peaked at 897.5 mm (35.33 in) in Gangneung. [SEP] [CLS] A 24-hour total of 880 mm (35 in) in the city broke the record for the highest daily precipitation in the country; however, the heaviest rainfall was localized. [SEP] [CLS] Over 17,000 houses were damaged, and large areas of crop fields were flooded. [SEP] [CLS] In South Korea, Rusa killed at least 233 people, making it the deadliest typhoon there in over 43 years, and caused $4.2 billion in damage. [SEP] [CLS] The typhoon also dropped heavy rainfall in neighboring North Korea, leaving 26,000 people homeless and killing three. [SEP] [CLS] Rusa also destroyed large areas of crops in the country already affected by ongoing famine conditions. [SEP] [CLS] The typhoon later became extratropical over eastern Russia on September 1, dissipating three days later. [SEP] [CLS]
