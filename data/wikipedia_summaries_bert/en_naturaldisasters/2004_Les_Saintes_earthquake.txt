[CLS] The 2004 Les Saintes earthquake occurred at 07:41:07 local time on November 21 with a moment magnitude of 6.3 and a maximum EMS-98 intensity of VIII (Heavily damaging). [SEP] [CLS] The shock was named for ÃŽles des Saintes "Island of the Saints", a small island to the south of Guadeloupe, which is an overseas department of France. [SEP] [CLS] Although it occurred near the Lesser Antilles subduction zone, this was an intraplate, normal fault event. [SEP] [CLS] It resulted in one death, thirteen injuries, and forty people being made homeless, but the overall damage was considered moderate. [SEP] [CLS] A small, nondestructive tsunami was reported, but runup and inundation distances were difficult to measure due to a storm that occurred on the day of the event. [SEP] [CLS] Unusual effects at a volcanic lake on Dominica were also documented, and an aftershock caused additional damage three months later. [SEP] [CLS]
