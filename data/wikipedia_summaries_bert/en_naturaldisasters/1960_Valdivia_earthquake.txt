The 1960 Valdivia earthquake (Spanish: Terremoto de Valdivia) or the Great Chilean earthquake (Gran terremoto de Chile) on 22 May 1960 is the most powerful earthquake ever recorded. [CLS] [SEP] Various studies have placed it at 9.4â€“9.6 on the moment magnitude scale. [CLS] [SEP] It occurred in the afternoon (19:11 GMT, 15:11 local time), and lasted approximately 10 minutes. [CLS] [SEP] The resulting tsunamis affected southern Chile, Hawaii, Japan, the Philippines, eastern New Zealand, southeast Australia, and the Aleutian Islands. [CLS] [SEP] The epicenter of this megathrust earthquake was near Lumaco, approximately 570 kilometres (350 mi) south of Santiago, with Valdivia being the most affected city. [CLS] [SEP] The tremor caused localised tsunamis that severely battered the Chilean coast, with waves up to 25 metres (82 ft). [CLS] [SEP] The main tsunami traveled across the Pacific Ocean and devastated Hilo, Hawaii. [CLS] [SEP] Waves as high as 10.7 metres (35 ft) were recorded 10,000 kilometres (6,200 mi) from the epicenter, and as far away as Japan and the Philippines. [CLS] [SEP] The death toll and monetary losses arising from this widespread disaster are not certain. [CLS] [SEP] Various estimates of the total number of fatalities from the earthquake and tsunamis have been published, ranging between 1,000 and 7,000 killed. [CLS] [SEP] Different sources have estimated the monetary cost ranged from US$400 million to $800 million (or $3.46 billion to $6.91 billion in 2019, adjusted for inflation). [CLS] [SEP]
