[CLS] [SEP] His best-known books, Ficciones (Fictions) and El Aleph (The Aleph), published in the 1940s, are compilations of short stories interconnected by common themes, including dreams, labyrinths, philosophers, libraries, mirrors, fictional writers, and mythology. [CLS] [SEP] Borges' works have contributed to philosophical literature and the fantasy genre, and have been considered by some critics to mark the beginning of the magic realist movement in 20th century Latin American literature. [CLS] [SEP] His late poems converse with such cultural figures as Spinoza, Camões, and Virgil. [CLS] [SEP] Born in Buenos Aires, Borges later moved with his family to Switzerland in 1914, where he studied at the Collège de Genève.

[CLS] [SEP] In 1961, he came to international attention when he received the first Formentor prize (Prix International), which he shared with Samuel Beckett.
