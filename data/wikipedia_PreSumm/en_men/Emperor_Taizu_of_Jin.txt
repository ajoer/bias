[CLS] Emperor Taizu of Jin (August 1, 1068 – September 19, 1123), personal name Aguda, sinicised name Min (Chinese: 旻; pinyin: Mín), was the founder and first emperor of the Jurchen-led Jin dynasty, which ruled northern China between the 12th and 13th centuries. [SEP] [CLS] He was initially the chieftain of the Wanyan tribe, the most dominant among the Jurchen tribes which were subjects of the Khitan-led Liao dynasty. [SEP] [CLS] Starting in 1114, Aguda united the Jurchen tribes under his rule and rebelled against the Liao dynasty. [SEP] [CLS] A year later, he declared himself emperor and established the Jin dynasty. [SEP] [CLS] By the time of his death, the Jin dynasty had conquered most of the Liao dynasty's territories and emerged as a major power in northern China. [SEP] [CLS] In 1145, he was posthumously honoured with the temple name Taizu by his descendant, Emperor Xizong. [SEP] [CLS] The name [Wanyan] Aguda is transcribed [Wan-yen] A-ku-ta in Wade-Giles; the alternative spelling Akutta (possibly from reconstruction of Jurchen language) appears in a very small number of books as well.
