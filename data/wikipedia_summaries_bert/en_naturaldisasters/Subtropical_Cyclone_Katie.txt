Subtropical Cyclone Katie, unofficially named by researchers, was an unusual weather event in early 2015. [CLS] [SEP] After the 2014–15 South Pacific cyclone season had officially ended, a rare subtropical cyclone was identified outside of the basin near Easter Island, during early May, and was unofficially dubbed Katie by researchers. [CLS] [SEP] Katie was one of the few tropical or subtropical systems ever observed forming in the far Southeast Pacific, outside of the official basin boundary of 120°W, which marks the eastern edge of RSMC Nadi's and RSMC Wellington's warning areas, during the satellite era. [CLS] [SEP] Due to the fact that this storm developed outside of the official areas of responsibility of the warning agencies in the South Pacific, the storm was not officially included as a part of the 2014–15 South Pacific cyclone season. [CLS] [SEP] However, the Chilean Navy Weather Service issued High Seas Warnings on the system as an extratropical low. [CLS] [SEP]
