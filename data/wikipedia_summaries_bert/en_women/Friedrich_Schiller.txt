Johann Christoph Friedrich von Schiller (German: [ˈjoːhan ˈkʁɪstɔf ˈfʁiːdʁɪç fɔn ˈʃɪlɐ], short: pronounced [ˈfʁiː.dʁɪç ˈʃɪ.lɐ] (listen); 10 November 1759 – 9 May 1805) was a German poet, philosopher, physician, historian, and playwright. [CLS] [SEP] During the last seventeen years of his life (1788–1805), Schiller developed a productive, if complicated, friendship with the already famous and influential Johann Wolfgang von Goethe. [CLS] [SEP] They frequently discussed issues concerning aesthetics, and Schiller encouraged Goethe to finish works he left as sketches. [CLS] [SEP] This relationship and these discussions led to a period now referred to as Weimar Classicism. [CLS] [SEP] They also worked together on Xenien, a collection of short satirical poems in which both Schiller and Goethe challenge opponents of their philosophical vision. [CLS] [SEP]
