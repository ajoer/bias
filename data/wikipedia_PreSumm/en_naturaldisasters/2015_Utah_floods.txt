[CLS] Hurricane Linda was a strong tropical cyclone in September 2015 that resulted in heavy rains across portions of Mexico and the Southwestern United States. [SEP] [CLS] The seventeenth named storm and eleventh hurricane of the season, Linda developed southwest of Mexico from a low pressure area on September 5. [SEP] [CLS] Under warm sea surface temperatures and low to moderate wind shear, the system intensified into Tropical Storm Linda by September 6 and a hurricane by the next day. [SEP] [CLS] A well-defined eye soon formed within the storm's central dense overcast and Linda reached its peak intensity as a 125 mph (205 km/h) Category 3 major hurricane on the Saffir–Simpson hurricane wind scale on September 8. [SEP] [CLS] Thereafter, the storm moved into a stable environment and an area of lower sea surface temperatures, causing rapid weakening. [SEP] [CLS] Convective activity dissipated and Linda degenerated into a remnant low on September 10. [SEP] [CLS] The lingering system persisted southwest of Baja California, ultimately opening up into a trough on September 14. [SEP] [CLS] In Mexico, the storm brought rainfall to nine states, causing flooding, especially in Oaxaca, Sinaloa, and Zacatecas. [SEP] [CLS] In Oaxaca, mudslides resulted in the closure of multiple highways and damage to over a dozen homes. [SEP] [CLS] Flooding in Sinola affected approximately 1,000 homes with hundreds damaged, prompting dozens of families to evacuate. [SEP] [CLS] Several small communities were temporarily isolated after flood waters covered bridges. [SEP] [CLS] Localized flooding in Zacatecas damaged crops and 25 dwellings; damage reached approximately 500,000 pesos (US$30,000). [SEP] [CLS] Although Linda did not directly impact land, moisture from the storm was pulled northeast into the Southwestern United States and enhanced the local monsoon. [SEP] [CLS] Los Angeles received 2.39 in (61 mm) of rain, contributing to the city's second wettest September on record. [SEP] [CLS] One fatality in the state occurred from a drowning at San Bernardino National Forest. [SEP] [CLS] Utah was impacted by major flash flooding incidents—with rainfall amounting to 1-in-100 year levels—which left 21 deaths in the state: 14 near Hildale and 7 in Zion National Park. [SEP] [CLS] Damage across the Southwest amounted to US$3.6 million. [SEP] [CLS]
