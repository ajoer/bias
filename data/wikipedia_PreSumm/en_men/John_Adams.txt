[CLS] John Adams (October 30, 1735 – July 4, 1826) was an American statesman, attorney, diplomat, writer, and Founding Father who served as the second president of the United States, from 1797 to 1801. [SEP] [CLS] Before his presidency, he was a leader of the American Revolution that achieved independence from Great Britain, and he served as the first vice president of the United States. [SEP] [CLS] Adams was a dedicated diarist and regularly corresponded with many important figures in early American history, including his wife and adviser Abigail Adams, and Thomas Jefferson. [SEP] [CLS] A lawyer and political activist prior to the revolution, Adams was devoted to the right to counsel and presumption of innocence. [SEP] [CLS] He defied anti-British sentiment and successfully defended British soldiers against murder charges arising from the Boston Massacre. [SEP] [CLS] Adams was a Massachusetts delegate to the Continental Congress and became a principal leader of the Revolution. [SEP] [CLS] He assisted in drafting the Declaration of Independence in 1776 and was its foremost advocate in Congress. [SEP] [CLS] As a diplomat in Europe, he helped negotiate the peace treaty with Great Britain and secured vital governmental loans. [SEP] [CLS] Adams was the primary author of the Massachusetts Constitution in 1780, which influenced the United States' own constitution, as did his earlier Thoughts on Government. [SEP] [CLS] Adams was elected to two terms as vice president under President George Washington and was elected as the United States' second president in 1796. [SEP] [CLS] He was the only president elected under the banner of the Federalist Party. [SEP] [CLS] During his single term, Adams encountered fierce criticism from the Jeffersonian Republicans and from some in his own Federalist Party, led by his rival Alexander Hamilton. [SEP] [CLS] Adams signed the controversial Alien and Sedition Acts and built up the Army and Navy in the undeclared "Quasi-War" with France. [SEP] [CLS] The main accomplishment of his presidency was a peaceful resolution of this conflict in the face of public anger and Hamilton's opposition. [SEP] [CLS] During his term, he became the first president to reside in the executive mansion now known as the White House. [SEP] [CLS] In his bid for reelection, opposition from Federalists and accusations of despotism from Republicans led to Adams's loss to his former friend Thomas Jefferson, and he retired to Massachusetts. [SEP] [CLS] He eventually resumed his friendship with Jefferson by initiating a correspondence that lasted fourteen years. [SEP] [CLS] He and his wife generated a family of politicians, diplomats, and historians now referred to as the Adams political family, which includes their son John Quincy Adams, the sixth president of the United States. [SEP] [CLS] John Adams died on July 4, 1826 – the fiftieth anniversary of the adoption of the Declaration of Independence – hours after Jefferson's death.
