Hurricane Uleki, also referred as Typhoon Uleki, was a long-lived tropical cyclone in August–September 1988 that had minimal effects on land. [CLS] [SEP] Originating from a disturbance in the Intertropical Convergence Zone in late-August, Uleki was identified as a tropical depression well to the southeast of Hawaii on August 28. [CLS] [SEP] Steady organization ensued as it moved west, becoming a tropical storm on August 30 and a hurricane on August 31. [CLS] [SEP] Rapid intensification took place thereafter and the storm reached its peak intensity on September 2 as a Category 3 on the Saffir–Simpson hurricane wind scale. [CLS] [SEP] Hurricane Hunters investigating the cyclone found peak winds of 125 mph (205 km/h) and a barometric pressure of 957 mbar (hPa; 28.26 inHg). [CLS] [SEP] Thereafter, Uleki stalled for two days to the southwest of Hawaii, resulting in heavy surf across the state. [CLS] [SEP] The dangerous swells killed two people on Oahu. [CLS] [SEP] Unfavorable environmental conditions caused weakening of the hurricane by September 4 as it resumed a west-northwest course away from Hawaii. [CLS] [SEP] Conditions later became favorable and Uleki acquired winds of 105 mph (165 mph) on September 7, constituting its secondary peak. [CLS] [SEP] The hurricane crossed the International Dateline on September 8 and was reclassified as typhoon. [CLS] [SEP] Remaining well away from land, the cyclone steadily weakened to a tropical storm by September 12. [CLS] [SEP] Gradually turning north and later east, the degrading cyclone transitioned into an extratropical cyclone four days later and ultimately dissipated on September 17 near the International Dateline.
