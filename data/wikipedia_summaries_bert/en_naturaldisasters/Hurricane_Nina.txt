Hurricane Nina was the final tropical storm and hurricane of the 1957 Pacific hurricane season and the last storm to form during the active Central Pacific hurricane season this year. [CLS] [SEP] This storm was named "Nina" because during this time, hurricanes in this basin were given names from the typhoon naming lists. [CLS] [SEP] This storm was the last to form during a series of typhoons to form in the Pacific in November.Nina never made landfall while active, although some forecasts called for Nina to be the first hurricane to make landfall on Hawaii, but the hurricane veered west before landing. [CLS] [SEP] However, it came close enough to Hawaii to cause light damage and prompt evacuations. [CLS] [SEP] Nina was the first hurricane to affect the island of Kauai at that intensity. [CLS] [SEP] This storm was preceded by a winter storm that caused damaging surf along the north coast of Kauai and was both preceded and proceeded by cold fronts sweeping over Hawaii. [CLS] [SEP]
