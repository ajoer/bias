[CLS] Widerøe Flight 744, also known as the Namsos Accident (Norwegian: Namsos-ulykken), was a controlled flight into terrain of a de Havilland Canada DHC-6-300 Twin Otter during approach to Namsos Airport, Høknesøra in Norway. [SEP] [CLS] The incident occurred on 27 October 1993 at 19:16:48 and killed six of the nineteen people on board, including the crew of two. [SEP] [CLS] The scheduled flight was en route between Trondheim Airport, Værnes via Namsos to Rørvik Airport, Ryum and the aircraft crashed at Berg in Overhalla because it held too low an altitude. [SEP] [CLS] Parallel investigations were carried out by Namdal Police District and the Accident Investigation Board for Civil Aviation (HSL). [SEP] [CLS] A conflict arose between the two as the latter in cooperation with the Norwegian Airline Pilots Association did not want a police investigation until after their report was finished. [SEP] [CLS] This caused the police to use two years to gain court permission to access the evidence. [SEP] [CLS] The report found no technical problems with the aircraft. [SEP] [CLS] However, it found several pilot errors and laid a large responsibility on the airline for lack of proper organization and routines. [SEP] [CLS] No-one was charged after the accident, but lead to a major restructure of operations and procedures in Widerøe. [SEP] [CLS]
