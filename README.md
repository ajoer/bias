# Bias

Data and code for bias and fairness evaluation of encoders.

So far this repo only contains the code for extracting summaries of pages on Wikipedia (films, restaurants and events), the extracted summaries and the initial list of pages.
Later this will also include the analysis and visualization code as well as resources and other data sources used in the project.
