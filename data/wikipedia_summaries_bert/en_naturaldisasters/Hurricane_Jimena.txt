Hurricane Jimena was the tenth named storm and second hurricane of the 2003 Pacific hurricane season. [CLS] [SEP] Jimena formed on August 28 in the far Eastern Pacific Ocean as a tropical depression and moved westward where it rapidly became a hurricane the following day. [CLS] [SEP] The storm moved westward into the Central Pacific Ocean where it became a Category 2 hurricane on the Saffir–Simpson Hurricane Scale. [CLS] [SEP] After reaching its peak strength as a Category 2 hurricane, the storm began to weaken due to increasing wind shear. [CLS] [SEP] Jimena brushed past the Hawaiian Islands before becoming a tropical depression on September 3. [CLS] [SEP] The weakening storm then crossed the international dateline before dissipating on September 5, becoming one of the few storms to cross both 140ºW and International Date Line. [CLS] [SEP] Jimena was the first Pacific hurricane to threaten Hawaii since Hurricane Daniel of the 2000 Pacific hurricane season.
