[CLS] Northwest Airlines Flight 253 was an international passenger flight from Amsterdam Airport Schiphol in the Netherlands, to Detroit Metropolitan Wayne County Airport in the United States. [SEP] [CLS] The flight was the target of a failed al-Qaeda bombing attempt on Christmas Day, December 25, 2009, in which a passenger tried to set off chemical explosives sewn to his underwear. [SEP] [CLS] There were 290 people on board the aircraftâ€”an Airbus A330-323E operated by Northwest Airlines, which had merged with Delta Air Lines the year before. [SEP] [CLS] Had the attempt succeeded, it would have surpassed American Airlines Flight 191 as the deadliest aviation occurrence on U.S. [SEP] [CLS] soil and tied Iran Air Flight 655 as the eighth-deadliest of all time. [SEP] [CLS] The incident was also the second in 2009 involving an Airbus A330, after the crash of Air France Flight 447 on June 1. [SEP] [CLS] This was also the final accident/incident involving Northwest Airlines as it closed down a month later when it merged with Delta Air Lines. [SEP] [CLS] The convicted bomber in the "Christmas Day bombing attempt" was 23-year-old Umar Farouk Abdulmutallab, a Nigerian man who had concealed plastic explosives in his underwear but failed to detonate them properly. [SEP] [CLS] A Dutch passenger, Jasper Schuringa, tackled and restrained him and put out the fire with the aid of others. [SEP] [CLS] Abdulmutallab was handcuffed while the pilot safely landed the plane. [SEP] [CLS] In all, three people were injured: Abdulmutallab, Schuringa, and one other passenger. [SEP] [CLS] Upon landing in Detroit, Abdulmutallab was arrested and taken to a hospital for treatment of his burns. [SEP] [CLS] On December 28, 2009, al-Qaeda in the Arabian Peninsula (AQAP) claimed responsibility for the attempted bombing. [SEP] [CLS] On January 6, 2010, a federal grand jury indicted Abdulmutallab on six criminal charges, including attempted use of a weapon of mass destruction and attempted murder. [SEP] [CLS] Reports indicated that the U.S. [SEP] [CLS] had received intelligence regarding a powder bomb planned attack by a Yemen-based Nigerian man. [SEP] [CLS] While describing security measures taken by U.S. [SEP] [CLS] and foreign governments in the immediate aftermath of the attack, U.S. [SEP] [CLS] Secretary of Homeland Security, Janet Napolitano, said, "once the incident occurred, the system worked." She cited "the actions of the passengers and the crew on this flight" to show "why that system is so important." After heavy criticism, she stated the following day that the system "failed miserably", this time referring to Abdulmutallab's boarding the flight with an explosive device. [SEP] [CLS] U.S. [SEP] [CLS] President Barack Obama called the U.S.'s failure to prevent the bombing attempt "totally unacceptable", and ordered an investigation.On April 6, 2010, it was reported that President Obama had authorized military action that took out Anwar al-Awlaki, a Muslim cleric who was accused by the Obama administration of being a Yemen-based al-Qaeda commander behind the plot. [SEP] [CLS] Al-Awlaki was killed on September 30, 2011. [SEP] [CLS]
