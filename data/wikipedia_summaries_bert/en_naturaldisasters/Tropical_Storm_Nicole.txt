Tropical Storm Nicole was a short-lived and unusually asymmetrical tropical cyclone that caused extensive damage, rainfall and flooding in Jamaica during the 2010 Atlantic hurricane season. [CLS] [SEP] It was the sixteenth tropical cyclone and the fourteenth named storm of the season, as well as the last of a record eight tropical storms to form in September. [CLS] [SEP] Originating from a broad monsoonal low, Nicole became a tropical depression over the northwestern Caribbean Sea on September 28. [CLS] [SEP] It maintained an unusual structure as it tracked northeastward, with a poorly defined wind circulation and few thunderstorms near its center. [CLS] [SEP] Nicole approached the coast of Cuba as a weak tropical storm, losing its status as a tropical cyclone over the territory on September 29. [CLS] [SEP] The remnants emerged over the Bahamas and eventually became absorbed by a separate extratropical system. [CLS] [SEP] Due to Nicole's atypical structure, the strongest thundershowers were well removed from the center; most of the weather activity occurred over the north-central Caribbean. [CLS] [SEP] In Jamaica, the storm triggered widespread power outages across more than 288,000 residences. [CLS] [SEP] Extreme precipitation of up to 37.42 inches (950 mm) caused disastrous flooding in several parishes, severely damaging or destroying 528 houses. [CLS] [SEP] The devastation extended to the island's farmland and environment, which suffered from expansive water pollution. [CLS] [SEP] In all, Nicole wrought an estimated $245.4 million (2010 USD) in damage throughout Jamaica, and there were sixteen fatalities. [CLS] [SEP] Elsewhere, minor flooding occurred in Cuba, Florida, and the Cayman Islands. [CLS] [SEP] The remnants of the storm contributed to a large disturbance along the East Coast of the United States, causing additional damage and deaths. [CLS] [SEP]
