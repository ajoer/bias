[CLS] The March 2019 North American blizzard was a powerful Colorado Low that produced up to two feet of snow in the plains and Midwest. [SEP] [CLS] Rapid snowmelt following the storm caused historic flooding, and some areas received hurricane-force wind gusts. [SEP] [CLS] Comparable to the 1993 Storm of the Century, the storm was labeled a bomb cyclone after barometric pressure readings dropped in excess of 24 mbar (0.71 inHg) over a 24-hour period. [SEP] [CLS] After the storm entered Colorado from its origination in Arizona, the pressure dropped more than 30 mbar (0.89 inHg) and rapidly intensified over the western High Plains. [SEP] [CLS] The severe storm set new all-time record low barometric pressure readings in Colorado, Kansas and New Mexico. [SEP] [CLS] The storm itself killed only one person in Colorado, but flooding caused by the storm killed at least 3, one in Iowa and at least two in Nebraska and left ~140,000 without power in Texas.
