Tropical Depression Nineteen-E was a weak yet costly tropical cyclone that caused significant flooding throughout Northwestern Mexico and several states within the United States in September 2018. [CLS] [SEP] The storm was also the first known tropical cyclone to form over the Gulf of California. [CLS] [SEP] Nineteen-E originated from a tropical wave that left the west coast of Africa on August 29 to 30. [CLS] [SEP] It continued westward, crossed over Central America, and entered the northeastern Pacific Ocean by September 7. [CLS] [SEP] It then meandered to the southwest of Mexico for the next several days as it interacted with a mid-to-upper level trough. [CLS] [SEP] The National Hurricane Center (NHC) continued to track the disturbance for the next several days as it traveled northward. [CLS] [SEP] A surface trough developed over the Baja California peninsula on September 18. [CLS] [SEP] Despite disorganization and having close proximity to land, the disturbance developed into a tropical depression in the Gulf of California on September 19, after having developed a circulation center and more concentrated convection. [CLS] [SEP] The system peaked with maximum sustained winds of 35 mph (55 km/h) and a minimum central pressure of 1002 mbar (29.59 inHg). [CLS] [SEP] One day after forming, the depression quickly deteriorated and dissipated after making landfall in Sonora. [CLS] [SEP] Overall, the depression affected eleven Mexican states, with torrential rainfall and flooding ensuing in Baja California Sur, Sinaloa, and Sonora. [CLS] [SEP] Thirteen individuals were killed in Chihuahua, Sinaloa, and Sonora, and over $40 million USD in agricultural losses were recorded. [CLS] [SEP] Excessive rainfall led to the inundation of at least 300,000 structures in Sinaloa. [CLS] [SEP] Flood damage there is estimated to be in the hundreds of millions (USD). [CLS] [SEP] Remnant moisture from Nineteen-E led to severe flooding within the U.S. [CLS] [SEP] states of Arizona, Texas, Oklahoma, and Arkansas and the death of one person. [CLS] [SEP] Damage estimates totaled about $250 million (USD) in the aforementioned states. [CLS] [SEP] Minor damage was also reported in New Mexico. [CLS] [SEP]
