Victoria (Alexandrina Victoria; 24 May 1819 â€“ 22 January 1901) was Queen of the United Kingdom of Great Britain and Ireland from 20 June 1837 until her death. [CLS] [SEP] She adopted the additional title of Empress of India on 1 May 1876. [CLS] [SEP] Known as the Victorian era, her reign of 63 years and seven months was longer than that of any of her predecessors. [CLS] [SEP] It was a period of industrial, cultural, political, scientific, and military change within the United Kingdom, and was marked by a great expansion of the British Empire. [CLS] [SEP] Victoria was the daughter of Prince Edward, Duke of Kent and Strathearn (the fourth son of King George III), and Princess Victoria of Saxe-Coburg-Saalfeld. [CLS] [SEP] After both the Duke and his father died in 1820, she was raised under close supervision by her mother and her comptroller, John Conroy. [CLS] [SEP] She inherited the throne aged 18 after her father's three elder brothers died without surviving legitimate issue. [CLS] [SEP] Though a constitutional monarch, privately, Victoria attempted to influence government policy and ministerial appointments; publicly, she became a national icon who was identified with strict standards of personal morality. [CLS] [SEP] Victoria married her cousin Prince Albert of Saxe-Coburg and Gotha in 1840. [CLS] [SEP] Their children married into royal and noble families across the continent, earning Victoria the sobriquet "the grandmother of Europe" and spreading haemophilia in European royalty. [CLS] [SEP] After Albert's death in 1861, Victoria plunged into deep mourning and avoided public appearances. [CLS] [SEP] As a result of her seclusion, republicanism in the United Kingdom temporarily gained strength, but in the latter half of her reign, her popularity recovered. [CLS] [SEP] Her Golden and Diamond Jubilees were times of public celebration. [CLS] [SEP] She died on the Isle of Wight in 1901. [CLS] [SEP] The last British monarch of the House of Hanover, she was succeeded by her son Edward VII of the House of Saxe-Coburg and Gotha. [CLS] [SEP]
