[CLS] Sauron (pronounced ) is the title character and the main antagonist, through the forging of the One Ring, of J. [SEP] [CLS] R. [SEP] [CLS] R. [SEP] [CLS] Tolkien's The Lord of the Rings, where he rules the land of Mordor and has the ambition of ruling the whole of Middle-earth. [SEP] [CLS] In the same work, he is identified as the "Necromancer" of Tolkien's earlier novel The Hobbit. [SEP] [CLS] In The Silmarillion, he is also described as the chief lieutenant of the first Dark Lord, Morgoth. [SEP] [CLS] Tolkien noted that the Ainur, the "angelic" powers of his constructed myth, "were capable of many degrees of error and failing", but by far the worst was "the absolute Satanic rebellion and evil of Morgoth and his satellite Sauron". [SEP] [CLS] Sauron appears most often as "the Eye", as if disembodied. [SEP] [CLS] Tolkien, while denying that absolute evil could exist, stated that Sauron came as near to a wholly evil will as was possible. [SEP] [CLS] Commentators have compared Sauron to Bram Stoker's 1897 Dracula, and to Balor of the Evil Eye in Celtic mythology. [SEP] [CLS] He is depicted as a humanoid figure in animated films of The Lord of the Rings. [SEP] [CLS] He is briefly seen in a similar form in Peter Jackson's films, which otherwise show him as a disembodied Eye. [SEP] [CLS]
