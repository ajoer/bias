The 1959 Escuminac disaster (also to referred to as the Escuminac hurricane) was considered the worst fishing-related disaster in New Brunswick in 100 years. [CLS] [SEP] It occurred due to the extratropical remnants of an Atlantic hurricane. [CLS] [SEP] The storm was the third tropical cyclone and first hurricane of the 1959 Atlantic hurricane season, and developed from a tropical wave in the central Gulf of Mexico on June 18. [CLS] [SEP] It headed rapidly northeastward and struck Florida later that day. [CLS] [SEP] Shortly after entering the Atlantic Ocean, it strengthened into a tropical storm later on June 18. [CLS] [SEP] By the following day, it had strengthened into a hurricane. [CLS] [SEP] However, it transitioned into an extratropical cyclone about six hours later. [CLS] [SEP] The remnants struck Atlantic Canada, once in Nova Scotia and again in Newfoundland before dissipating on June 21. [CLS] [SEP] In its early stages, the storm dropped moderately heavy rainfall in Florida, which caused damage to crops. [CLS] [SEP] A tornado near Miami and high tides on the west coast of the state also resulted in damage. [CLS] [SEP] Overall, losses in Florida were around $1.7 million (1959 USD). [CLS] [SEP] After becoming extratropical, the storm caused significant effects in Atlantic Canada. [CLS] [SEP] About 45 boats were in the Northumberland Strait between New Brunswick and Prince Edward Island, and they did not have radio to receive warning of the approaching storm. [CLS] [SEP] Rough seas of up to 49 ft (15 m) in height damaged or destroyed many boats. [CLS] [SEP] At least 22 fishing boats capsized with their crews, causing 35 fatalities. [CLS] [SEP] High winds also disrupted communications in some areas, and several houses were damaged, causing damage costing $750,000 (1959 CAD, $781,000 1959 USD). [CLS] [SEP] The event became the deadliest work-related disaster in New Brunswick. [CLS] [SEP]
