[CLS] The 1979 Coyote Lake earthquake occurred at 10:05:24 local time on August 6 with a moment magnitude of 5.7 and a maximum Mercalli Intensity of VII (Very strong). [SEP] [CLS] The shock occurred on the Calaveras Fault near Coyote Lake in Santa Clara County, California and resulted in a number of injuries, including some that required hospitalization. [SEP] [CLS] Most of the $500,000 in damage that was caused was non-structural, but several businesses were closed for repairs. [SEP] [CLS] Data from numerous strong motion instruments was used to determine the type, depth, and extent of slip. [SEP] [CLS] A non-destructive aftershock sequence that lasted throughout the remainder of the month was of interest to seismologists, especially with regard to fault creep, and following the event local governments evaluated their response to the incident.
