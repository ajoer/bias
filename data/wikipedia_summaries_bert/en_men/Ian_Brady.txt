[CLS] The Moors murders were carried out by Ian Brady and Myra Hindley between July 1963 and October 1965, in and around Manchester, England. [SEP] [CLS] The victims were five children—Pauline Reade, John Kilbride, Keith Bennett, Lesley Ann Downey and Edward Evans—aged between 10 and 17, at least four of whom were sexually assaulted. [SEP] [CLS] Two of the victims were discovered in graves dug on Saddleworth Moor; a third grave was discovered there in 1987, more than twenty years after Brady and Hindley's trial. [SEP] [CLS] Bennett's body is also thought to be buried there, but despite repeated searches it remains undiscovered. [SEP] [CLS] The pair were charged only in the deaths of Kilbride, Downey and Evans, and received life sentences. [SEP] [CLS] The investigation was reopened in 1985, after Brady was reported as having confessed to the murders of Reade and Bennett. [SEP] [CLS] After confessing to these additional murders, Brady and Hindley were taken separately to Saddleworth Moor to assist in the search for the graves. [SEP] [CLS] Characterised by the press as "the most evil woman in Britain", Hindley made several appeals against her life sentence, claiming she was a reformed woman and no longer a danger to society, but was never released. [SEP] [CLS] She died in 2002, aged 60, after serving 36 years in prison. [SEP] [CLS] Brady was diagnosed as a psychopath in 1985 and confined in the high-security Ashworth Hospital. [SEP] [CLS] He made it clear that he never wished to be released, and repeatedly asked to be allowed to die. [SEP] [CLS] He died in 2017, at Ashworth, aged 79. [SEP] [CLS] The murders were the result of what Malcolm MacCulloch, professor of forensic psychiatry at Cardiff University, called a "concatenation of circumstances". [SEP] [CLS] The trial judge, Mr Justice Fenton Atkinson, described Brady and Hindley in his closing remarks as "two sadistic killers of the utmost depravity". [SEP] [CLS] Their crimes were the subject of extensive worldwide media coverage. [SEP] [CLS]
