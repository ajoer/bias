Tropical Storm Colin was the earliest third named storm in the Atlantic basin on record for 4 years until it was surpassed by Tropical Storm Cristobal in 2020. [CLS] [SEP] An atypical, poorly organized tropical cyclone, Colin developed from a low pressure area over the Gulf of Mexico near the northern coast of the Yucat√°n Peninsula late on June 5, 2016. [CLS] [SEP] Moving northward, the depression strengthened into a tropical storm about eight hours after formation. [CLS] [SEP] On June 6, Colin curved to the north-northeast and intensified slightly to winds of 50 mph (85 km/h). [CLS] [SEP] Strong wind shear prevented further strengthening and resulted in the system maintaining a disheveled appearance on satellite imagery. [CLS] [SEP] Later, the storm began accelerating to the northeast. [CLS] [SEP] Early on June 7, Colin made landfall in rural Taylor County, Florida, still at peak intensity. [CLS] [SEP] The system rapidly crossed northern Florida and emerged into the Atlantic Ocean several hours later. [CLS] [SEP] By late on June 7, Colin transitioned into an extratropical cyclone offshore North Carolina before being absorbed by a frontal boundary the following day. [CLS] [SEP] Upon the development of Colin on June 5, a tropical storm warning was issued for much of the west coast of Florida, followed by tropical storm warnings and watches on Atlantic coast from Central Florida to North Carolina later on June 5 and June 6. [CLS] [SEP] Governor of Florida Rick Scott declared a state of emergency, while schools and colleges closed in several counties. [CLS] [SEP] The storm produced heavy rainfall over portions of Florida, resulting in flooding in some areas, especially Hillsborough and Pinellas counties. [CLS] [SEP] There, the freshwater flooding was compounded by coastal flooding from high tides. [CLS] [SEP] Winds caused over 93,300 power outages throughout the state. [CLS] [SEP] The storm spawned two tornadoes, one of which knocked down trees and damaged several cars and homes in Jacksonville. [CLS] [SEP] Four fatalities occurred in the Florida Panhandle due to drowning. [CLS] [SEP] Heavy rainfall was also observed in portions of Georgia, North Carolina, and South Carolina. [CLS] [SEP] Two additional drowning deaths occurred in Georgia. [CLS] [SEP] Damage throughout the East Coast reached $1.04 million (2016 USD). [CLS] [SEP]
