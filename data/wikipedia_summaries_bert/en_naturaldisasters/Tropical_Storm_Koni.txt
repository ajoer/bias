Severe Tropical Storm Koni, known in the Philippines as Tropical Storm Gilas, caused moderate damage to areas of China and Vietnam in July 2003. [CLS] [SEP] The eighth tropical storm in the western Pacific that year, Koni originated from a disturbance situated within the monsoon trough well east of the Philippines on July 15. [CLS] [SEP] Tracking westward, intensification was slow and the system remained a tropical depression as it moved across the central Philippines on July 17. [CLS] [SEP] Upon moving into the South China Sea, however, conditions allowed for quicker strengthening, and as such the cyclone reached tropical storm status on July 18 before reaching its peak intensity with maximum sustained winds of 110 km/h (70 mph) and a minimum barometric pressure of 975 mbar (hPa; 28.79 inHg), making it a severe tropical storm. [CLS] [SEP] However, atmospheric conditions began to deteriorate as Koni made landfall on Hainan on July 21, weakening the system. [CLS] [SEP] The tropical storm continued to weaken as it moved over the Gulf of Tonkin prior to a final landfall near Hanoi, Vietnam the following day. [CLS] [SEP] Tracking inland, the combination of land interaction and wind shear caused Koni to dissipate over Laos on July 23. [CLS] [SEP] Shortly after development Koni tracked through the Philippines, killing two people. [CLS] [SEP] After moving into the South China Sea, turbulence produced by the storm resulted in an aviation incident involving a commercial airliner off the western Philippines. [CLS] [SEP] Three of the plane's occupants received minor injuries. [CLS] [SEP] In Hainan, Koni caused heavy rainfall, peaking at 189 mm (7.44 in) at a station on Wuzhi Mountain. [CLS] [SEP] The rains resulted in the collapse of 1,400 homes and an estimated CNÂ¥140.27 million (US$16.9 million) in direct economic losses. [CLS] [SEP] Effects were worst in Vietnam, where three people were killed. [CLS] [SEP] Widespread power outages occurred, and strong winds resulted in agricultural and infrastructural damage, particularly in Vietnam's northern provinces. [CLS] [SEP]
