National Airlines Flight 27 was a scheduled passenger flight between Miami and San Francisco with intermediate stops at New Orleans, Houston, and Las Vegas, operated by a DC-10-10 aircraft (N60NA). [CLS] [SEP] On November 3, 1973, at about 4:40 p.m., while the aircraft was cruising at 39,000 feet (12,000 m) 65 miles southwest of Albuquerque, the No. [CLS] [SEP] 3 (starboard) engine fan assembly disintegrated in an uncontained failure. [CLS] [SEP] Its fragments penetrated the fuselage, the Nos. [CLS] [SEP] 1 and 2 engine nacelles, and the right wing area. [CLS] [SEP] The resultant damage caused decompression of the aircraft cabin and the loss of certain electrical and hydraulic systems.One passenger was partially forced into the opening made by a failed cabin window, after it too was struck by engine fragments. [CLS] [SEP] He was temporarily retained in that position by his seatbelt. [CLS] [SEP] "Efforts to pull the passenger back into the airplane by another passenger were unsuccessful, and the occupant of seat 17H was forced entirely through the cabin window."The flight crew initiated an emergency descent, and the aircraft was landed safely at Albuquerque International Sunport 19 minutes after the engine failed. [CLS] [SEP] 115 passengers and 12 crew members exited the aircraft by using the evacuation slides. [CLS] [SEP] Of those, 24 people were treated for smoke inhalation, ear problems, and minor abrasions. [CLS] [SEP] The plane was repaired and was later flown by Pan Am (as Clipper Meteor). [CLS] [SEP] The New Mexico State Police and local organizations searched extensively for the missing passenger who was sucked out of the window. [CLS] [SEP] A computer analysis was made of the possible falling trajectories, which narrowed the search pattern. [CLS] [SEP] However, the search effort was unsuccessful, and the body of the passenger was not recovered until two years later, when a construction crew working on the tracks for the Very Large Array radio telescope came upon his skeletal remains, which took another year for the medical investigator in Albuquerque to identify.
