[CLS] Hurricane Bonnie was a major hurricane that made landfall in North Carolina, United States, inflicting severe crop damage. [SEP] [CLS] The second named storm, first hurricane, and first major hurricane of the 1998 Atlantic hurricane season, Bonnie developed from a tropical wave that emerged off the coast of Africa on August 14. [SEP] [CLS] The wave gradually developed, and the system was designated a tropical depression on August 19. [SEP] [CLS] The depression began tracking towards the west-northwest, and became a tropical storm the next day. [SEP] [CLS] On August 22, Bonnie was upgraded to a hurricane, with a well-defined eye. [SEP] [CLS] The storm peaked as a Category 3 hurricane on the Saffir-Simpson Hurricane Scale, and around the same time, the storm slowed and turned more towards the north-northwest. [SEP] [CLS] A large and powerful cyclone, Bonnie moved ashore in North Carolina early on August 27, slowing as it turned northeast. [SEP] [CLS] After briefly losing hurricane status, the storm moved offshore and regained Category 1-force winds, although it weakened again on entering cooler waters. [SEP] [CLS] Fearing a major hurricane strike, coastal locations from Florida to Virginia performed extensive preparations in advance of the storm. [SEP] [CLS] In addition to tropical cyclone watches and warnings, about 950,000 people were evacuated from the Carolinas, and the military evacuated and relocated hundreds of aircraft and vessels from the storm's projected path. [SEP] [CLS] Soldiers and guardsmen were deployed throughout those regions. [SEP] [CLS] Hurricane Bonnie made landfall as a borderline Category 2â€“Category 3 storm, with intense wind gusts of up to 104 mph (167 km/h) and rainfall peaking at about 11 in (280 mm). [SEP] [CLS] Reports of downed trees and powerlines, as well as structural damage such as blown-out windows and torn-off roofs, were reported. [SEP] [CLS] In coastal North Carolina, the storm washed ashore tens of thousands of tires that had been part of an artificial reef. [SEP] [CLS] Crop damage was extensive, but the storm was overall less severe than initially feared. [SEP] [CLS] Total damage was estimated at $1 billion (1998 USD). [SEP] [CLS]
