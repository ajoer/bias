[CLS] [SEP] 2 dozens houses have been swept by the landslide. [CLS] [SEP] The landslide had a volume of 5.5 million cubic metres.This landslide had massive effects far beyond, not evident from the pictures. [CLS] [SEP] The dammed river was threatening to unleash a torrent of water to hundreds of downstream villages that would ravage as far as Northern India. [CLS] [SEP] Despite the use of dynamite, it took the Nepali Army 45 days to dig a canal through the blockage to allow water in the lake to drain. [CLS] [SEP] The lake created was 47 meters deep and over 400 meters long.
