[CLS] Bernart de Ventadorn, also known as Bernard de Ventadour or Bernat del Ventadorn, was a prominent troubadour of the classical age of troubadour poetry. [SEP] [CLS] He was born in 1135, and died in 1194. [SEP] [CLS] Now thought of as "the Master Singer" he developed the cançons into a more formalized style which allowed for sudden turns. [SEP] [CLS] He is remembered for his mastery as well as popularisation of the trobar leu style, and for his prolific cançons, which helped define the genre and establish the "classical" form of courtly love poetry, to be imitated and reproduced throughout the remaining century and a half of troubadour activity.Bernart was known for being able to portray his woman as a divine agent in one moment and then, in a sudden twist, as Eve – the cause of man's initial sin. [SEP] [CLS] This dichotomy in his work is portrayed in a "graceful, witty, and polished" medium. [SEP] [CLS]
