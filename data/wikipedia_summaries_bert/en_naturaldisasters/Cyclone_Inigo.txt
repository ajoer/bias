Cyclone Inigo was tied with Cyclone Gwenda for being the most intense recorded cyclone in the Australian region in terms of pressure, with the possible exception of Cyclone Mahina. [CLS] [SEP] Inigo developed from a tropical low that crossed eastern Indonesia in late March 2003. [CLS] [SEP] Becoming a named tropical cyclone on 1 April, Inigo rapidly intensified as it tracked southwestward, reaching a minimum central pressure of 900 hPa on 4 April. [CLS] [SEP] An approaching trough weakened the cyclone and turned it to the southeast, and on 8 April, Inigo dissipated after making landfall on Western Australia, as a minimal tropical storm. [CLS] [SEP] The precursor disturbance dropped heavy rainfall across eastern Indonesia, causing widespread flooding and mudslides. [CLS] [SEP] The worst of the damage was on Flores island, though damage was also reported on West Timor and Sumba. [CLS] [SEP] The flooding and mudslides damaged or destroyed thousands of houses, forcing many to leave their homes. [CLS] [SEP] A total of 58 casualties were reported in association with Inigo, as a disturbance. [CLS] [SEP] In Australia, Inigo produced locally heavy rainfall, but did little damage. [CLS] [SEP]
