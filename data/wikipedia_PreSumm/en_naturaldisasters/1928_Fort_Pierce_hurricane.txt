[CLS] The 1928 Fort Pierce hurricane devastated areas of Florida and the Southeastern United States in August 1928. [SEP] [CLS] The first tropical cyclone and hurricane of the annual hurricane season, the storm developed from a tropical wave first identified on August 3, 1928, north of the Virgin Islands. [SEP] [CLS] Slowly intensifying as it moved west-northwest, the system paralleled the Greater Antilles throughout much of its early existence. [SEP] [CLS] On August 5, the tropical storm strengthened to the equivalent of a Category 1 hurricane, while positioned over The Bahamas. [SEP] [CLS] The hurricane continued to intensify, and after reaching Category 2 hurricane strength, attained its peak intensity on August 7 with winds of 105 mph (165 km/h) and a minimum barometric pressure of 971 mbar (hPa; 28.70 inHg). [SEP] [CLS] Shortly after, the hurricane made landfall as a slightly weaker storm just southeast of Fort Pierce, Florida at 0700 UTC on August 8. [SEP] [CLS] Weakening as it moved across the Florida peninsula over the course of the next day, the storm briefly moved over the Gulf of Mexico before recurving northwards. [SEP] [CLS] Thus, it made a second landfall on the Florida Panhandle on August 10 as a tropical storm. [SEP] [CLS] Once inland, the system continued to weaken, degenerating to tropical depression strength before transitioning into an extratropical storm later that day. [SEP] [CLS] The extratropical remnants progressed outwards into the Atlantic Ocean before entirely dissipating by August 14. [SEP] [CLS] In its early developmental stages north of the Greater Antilles, the storm caused minor damage to shipping in The Bahamas and generated rough seas offshore Cuba. [SEP] [CLS] At its first landfall on Fort Pierce, the hurricane caused extensive property damage, particularly in coastal regions, where numerous homes were unroofed. [SEP] [CLS] Central Florida's citrus crop was hampered by the strong winds and heavy rain. [SEP] [CLS] Several of Florida's lakes, including Lake Okeechobee, rose past their banks, inundating coastal areas. [SEP] [CLS] Damage to infrastructure was less in inland regions than at the coast, though power outages caused loss of communication statewide. [SEP] [CLS] At the hurricane's second landfall, wind damage was relatively minor, though torrential rainfall, aided by orthographic lift, caused extensive flooding as far north as the Mid-Atlantic states. [SEP] [CLS] Overall, the hurricane caused $235,000 in damages, primarily in Florida, and two deaths. [SEP] [CLS]
