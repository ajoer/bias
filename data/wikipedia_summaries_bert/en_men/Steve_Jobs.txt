[SEP] [CLS] Jobs is widely recognized as a pioneer of the personal computer revolution of the 1970s and 1980s, along with Apple co-founder Steve Wozniak. [SEP] [CLS] Jobs was born in San Francisco, California, and put up for adoption. [SEP] [CLS] He was raised in the San Francisco Bay Area.

[SEP] [CLS] His declassified FBI report states that he used marijuana and LSD while he was in college, and once told a reporter that taking LSD was "one of the two or three most important things" he had done in his life. [SEP] [CLS] Jobs and Wozniak co-founded Apple in 1976 to sell Wozniak's Apple I personal computer. [SEP] [CLS] Together the duo gained fame and wealth a year later with the Apple II, one of the first highly successful mass-produced microcomputers. [SEP] [CLS] Jobs saw the commercial potential of the Xerox Alto in 1979, which was mouse-driven and had a graphical user interface (GUI). [SEP] [CLS] This led to the development of the unsuccessful Apple Lisa in 1983, followed by the breakthrough Macintosh in 1984, the first mass-produced computer with a GUI. [SEP] [CLS] The Macintosh introduced the desktop publishing industry in 1985 with the addition of the Apple LaserWriter, the first laser printer to feature vector graphics. [SEP] [CLS] Jobs was forced out of Apple in 1985 after a long power struggle with the company's board and its then-CEO John Sculley. [SEP] [CLS] That same year, Jobs took a few of Apple's members with him to found NeXT, a computer platform development company that specialized in computers for higher-education and business markets. [SEP] [CLS] In addition, he helped to develop the visual effects industry when he funded the computer graphics division of George Lucas's Lucasfilm in 1986. [SEP] [CLS] The new company was Pixar, which produced the first 3D computer animated feature film Toy Story (1995).

[SEP] [CLS] He was largely responsible for helping revive Apple, which had been on the verge of bankruptcy. [SEP] [CLS] He worked closely with designer Jony Ive to develop a line of products that had larger cultural ramifications, beginning in 1997 with the "Think different" advertising campaign and leading to the iMac, iTunes, iTunes Store, Apple Store, iPod, iPhone, App Store, and the iPad. [SEP] [CLS] In 2001, the original Mac OS was replaced with a completely new Mac OS X, based on NeXT's NeXTSTEP platform, giving the OS a modern Unix-based foundation for the first time.
