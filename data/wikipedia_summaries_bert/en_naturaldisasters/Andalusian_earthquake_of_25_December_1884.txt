[CLS] [SEP] 10,715 buildings were badly damaged, of which 4,399 were completely destroyed. [CLS] [SEP] Fortunately, many people were in the streets celebrating Christmas, or casualties would have been higher, but there were over 1,200 deaths and 1,500 serious injuries. [CLS] [SEP] The heavy snow that followed the earthquake caused further suffering and deaths. [CLS] [SEP] Help was slow to arrive at first, but as the news spread food and blankets arrived, then tents, and then donations from around the world helped with reconstruction. [CLS] [SEP]
