[CLS] British Airways Flight 38 was a scheduled international passenger flight from Beijing Capital International Airport in Beijing, China to London Heathrow Airport in London, United Kingdom. [SEP] [CLS] On 17 January 2008, the Boeing 777-200ER aircraft operating the flight crashed just short of the runway while landing at Heathrow. [SEP] [CLS] There were no fatalities. [SEP] [CLS] Of the 152 people on board, 47 sustained injuries, one serious. [SEP] [CLS] It was the first time in the model's history that a Boeing 777-200ER was written off, and the first hull loss of any Boeing 777. [SEP] [CLS] The accident was investigated by the Air Accidents Investigation Branch (AAIB) and a final report was issued in 2010. [SEP] [CLS] Ice crystals in the jet fuel were blamed as the cause of the accident, clogging the fuel-oil heat exchanger (FOHE) of each engine. [SEP] [CLS] This restricted fuel flow to the engines when thrust was demanded during the final approach to Heathrow. [SEP] [CLS] The AAIB identified the problem as specific to the Rolls-Royce engine fuel-oil heat exchangers, and Rolls-Royce subsequently developed a modification to its FOHE; the European Aviation Safety Agency (EASA) mandated that all affected aircraft were to be fitted with the modification before 1 January 2011.
