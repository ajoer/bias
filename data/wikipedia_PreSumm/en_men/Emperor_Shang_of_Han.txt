[CLS] Emperor Shang of Han (Chinese: 漢殤帝; pinyin: Hàn Shāng Dì; Wade–Giles: Han Shang-ti; Late October or Early November 105 – 21 September 106) was an infant emperor of the Chinese Han Dynasty and the fifth emperor of the Eastern Han. [SEP] [CLS] The Empress Dowager Deng placed him on the throne when he was barely over 100 days old, despite his having an older brother, Liu Sheng (劉勝), whose age was unknown but was likely to be young as well. [SEP] [CLS] Empress Dowager Deng also kept Liu Hu (劉祜), the twelve-year-old cousin of Shangdi and future Emperor An of Han in the capital Luoyang as insurance against the baby emperor's death. [SEP] [CLS] Liu Hu ascended to the throne when Emperor Shang died in 106; however, Dowager Deng still remained as the regent for the teenager Emperor An. [SEP] [CLS] A decree by Empress Dowager Deng during this reign shed light on bureaucratic inefficiency. [SEP] [CLS]
