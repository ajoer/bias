[CLS] Hurricane Max was a short-lived Category 1 hurricane that made landfall in southwestern Mexico, causing minor damage. [SEP] [CLS] The sixteenth tropical cyclone, thirteenth named storm, and seventh hurricane of the 2017 Pacific hurricane season, Max developed from a trough of low pressure near the southwestern coast of Mexico on September 13. [SEP] [CLS] The storm tracked northeastward under the influence of a mid-level ridge and rapidly strengthened as a result of warm ocean temperatures in its path. [SEP] [CLS] Max strengthened into a hurricane on September 14 and peaked as a high-end Category 1 hurricane on the Saffir-Simpson Scale shortly before making landfall in the Mexican state of Guerrero. [SEP] [CLS] Rapid weakening ensued as Max moved over the mountainous terrain of Mexico, and it weakened below hurricane strength early on September 15. [SEP] [CLS] At 12:00 UTC that day, Max dissipated over the mountains of southern Mexico. [SEP] [CLS] The Government of Mexico issued numerous tropical storm and hurricane watches and warnings in anticipation of Max's arrival. [SEP] [CLS] Due to the small size of the cyclone, effects were relatively localized and confined to a small area. [SEP] [CLS] Regardless, large waves, flooding, mudslides, and sinkholes caused by Max caused moderate damage in the state of Guerrero. [SEP] [CLS] Over 1,500 residences suffered flood damage, and numerous roads across the state, including Mexican Federal Highway 200, were closed due to landslides and sinkholes. [SEP] [CLS] One death was associated with Max, with another declared missing. [SEP] [CLS]
