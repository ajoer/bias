Cyclone Forrest, also referred to as Tropical Storm Forrest, was a powerful tropical cyclone that prompted the evacuation of 600,000 people in Bangladesh in late November 1992. [CLS] [SEP] Originating from an area of disturbed weather near the Caroline Islands on November 9, Forrest was classified as a tropical depression three days later over the South China Sea. [CLS] [SEP] Tracking generally west, the system steadily organized into a tropical storm, passing Vietnam to the south, before striking Thailand along the Malay Peninsula on November 15. [CLS] [SEP] Once over the Bay of Bengal, Forrest turned northward on November 17 and significantly intensified. [CLS] [SEP] It reached its peak intensity on November 20 as a Category 4-equivalent cyclone on the Saffir–Simpson hurricane scale with winds of 230 km/h (145 mph). [CLS] [SEP] Hostile environmental conditions soon affected the cyclone as it turned abruptly east-northeastward. [CLS] [SEP] Forrest made landfall in northwestern Myanmar as a weakening system on November 21 before dissipating early the next day. [CLS] [SEP] The majority of deaths associated with Forrest resulted from a plane crash on November 14 in Vietnam which killed 30 of the 31 occupants. [CLS] [SEP] In Thailand, the system produced significant storm surge, damaged or destroyed 1,700 homes, and killed two people. [CLS] [SEP] Agricultural losses in the hardest hit areas were estimated at ฿800 million (US$32 million). [CLS] [SEP] On November 20, as Forrest reached its peak intensity, fears arose across Bangladesh that a repeat of the catastrophic April 1991 cyclone would take place. [CLS] [SEP] As a result, mass evacuation plans were enacted across coastal areas of the country, with plans to relocate up to 2 million people. [CLS] [SEP] But the storm abruptly turned eastward, and the successful evacuation of 600,000 residents spared countless lives. [CLS] [SEP] Only two deaths were recorded and overall damage was light, though half of all homes on St. [CLS] [SEP] Martin's Island were damaged. [CLS] [SEP]
