[CLS] The 2020 Pacific typhoon season is a late-starting, ongoing event in the annual cycle of tropical cyclone formation, in which tropical cyclones form in the western Pacific Ocean. [SEP] [CLS] The season runs throughout the year, though most tropical cyclones typically develop between May and October. [SEP] [CLS] The season has been unusually quiet, with only nine systems forming as of August 13. [SEP] [CLS] Additionally, the JTWC recorded no tropical cyclone development in the month of July, the first such occurrence since reliable records began. [SEP] [CLS] The season's first tropical cyclone developed on May 10, making it the sixth-latest start in the basin on record, just slightly behind 1973, and the first to start this late since 2016. [SEP] [CLS] The season's first named storm, Vongfong (Ambo), developed east of Mindanao and rapidly intensified to become a Category 3 typhoon at peak intensity, undergoing an eyewall replacement cycle and made landfall on Samar Island, causing US$31.1 million damage to the Philippines, while in the midst of the current COVID-19 pandemic. [SEP] [CLS] The scope of this article is limited to the Pacific Ocean to the north of the equator between 100°E and 180th meridian. [SEP] [CLS] Within the northwestern Pacific Ocean, there are two separate agencies that assign names to tropical cyclones which can often result in a cyclone having two names. [SEP] [CLS] The Japan Meteorological Agency (JMA) will name a tropical cyclone should it be judged to have 10-minute sustained wind speeds of at least 65 km/h (40 mph) anywhere in the basin, whilst the Philippine Atmospheric, Geophysical and Astronomical Services Administration (PAGASA) assigns names to tropical cyclones which move into or form as a tropical depression in their area of responsibility located between 135°E and 115°E and between 5°N–25°N regardless of whether or not a tropical cyclone has already been given a name by the JMA. [SEP] [CLS] Tropical depressions that are monitored by the United States' Joint Typhoon Warning Center (JTWC) are given a number with a "W" suffix. [SEP] [CLS]
