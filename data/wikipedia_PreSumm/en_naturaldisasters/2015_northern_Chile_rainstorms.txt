[CLS] Easter Island (Rapa Nui: Rapa Nui, Spanish: Isla de Pascua) is an island and special territory of Chile in the southeastern Pacific Ocean, at the southeasternmost point of the Polynesian Triangle in Oceania. [SEP] [CLS] Easter Island is most famous for its nearly 1,000 extant monumental statues, called moai, created by the early Rapa Nui people. [SEP] [CLS] In 1995, UNESCO named Easter Island a World Heritage Site, with much of the island protected within Rapa Nui National Park. [SEP] [CLS] It is believed that Easter Island's Polynesian inhabitants arrived on Easter Island sometime near 1200 AD. [SEP] [CLS] They created a thriving and industrious culture, as evidenced by the island's numerous enormous stone moai and other artifacts. [SEP] [CLS] However, land clearing for cultivation and the introduction of the Polynesian rat led to gradual deforestation. [SEP] [CLS] By the time of European arrival in 1722, the island's population was estimated to be 2,000 to 3,000. [SEP] [CLS] European diseases, Peruvian slave raiding expeditions in the 1860s, and emigration to other islands, e.g. [SEP] [CLS] Tahiti, further depleted the population, reducing it to a low of 111 native inhabitants in 1877.Chile annexed Easter Island in 1888. [SEP] [CLS] In 1966, the Rapa Nui were granted Chilean citizenship. [SEP] [CLS] In 2007 the island gained the constitutional status of "special territory" (Spanish: territorio especial). [SEP] [CLS] Administratively, it belongs to the Valparaíso Region, constituting a single commune of the Province Isla de Pascua. [SEP] [CLS] The 2017 Chilean census registered 7,750 people on the island, of whom 3,512 (45%) considered themselves Rapa Nui.Easter Island is one of the most remote inhabited islands in the world. [SEP] [CLS] The nearest inhabited land (around 50 residents in 2013) is Pitcairn Island, 2,075 kilometres (1,289 mi) away; the nearest town with a population over 500 is Rikitea, on the island of Mangareva, 2,606 km (1,619 mi) away; the nearest continental point lies in central Chile, 3,512 kilometres (2,182 mi) away. [SEP] [CLS] Easter Island is considered part of Insular Chile. [SEP] [CLS]
