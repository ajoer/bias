[CLS] Cyclone Honorinina was a powerful tropical cyclone that struck eastern Madagascar in March 1986. [SEP] [CLS] The eighth named storm of the season, Honorinina formed on March 9 to the south of Diego Garcia. [SEP] [CLS] It moved generally to the west-southwest due to a ridge to the south, gradually intensifying. [SEP] [CLS] On March 12, the Météo France office on Réunion (MFR) upgraded Honorinina to tropical cyclone status, which is the equivalent of a minimal hurricane. [SEP] [CLS] On the next day, the cyclone attained maximum sustained winds of 150 km/h (95 mph) while in the vicinity of Tromelin Island. [SEP] [CLS] Honorinina weakened subsequently before making landfall about 40 km (25 mi) north of Toamasina, Madagascar with winds of 135 km/h (85 mph). [SEP] [CLS] The storm weakened further over land, moving southwestward across the country. [SEP] [CLS] It emerged into the Mozambique Channel and became extratropical on March 18. [SEP] [CLS] Honorinina turned to the southeast, dissipating on March 23. [SEP] [CLS] Early in its duration, the storm produced gusty winds along St. [SEP] [CLS] Brandon, and it later brought gusts of 158 km/h (98 mph) on Tromelin Island. [SEP] [CLS] However, effects were worst in Madagascar, especially in Toamasina near where the storm made landfall. [SEP] [CLS] Damage spread along 800 km (500 mi) of the coastline and spread 100 km (60 mi) inland from the landfall point, with many towns severely affected. [SEP] [CLS] In Toamasina, the cyclone damaged the main port, the airport, and several warehouses, resulting in $17 million (1986 USD) of lost inventory. [SEP] [CLS] Thousands of houses were damaged, leaving 83,885 people homeless; a housing program earlier set up after Cyclone Kamisy in 1984 was extended to help storm victims after Honorinina. [SEP] [CLS] Nationwide, the cyclone killed 99 people and caused $150 million (1986 USD) in damage. [SEP] [CLS]
