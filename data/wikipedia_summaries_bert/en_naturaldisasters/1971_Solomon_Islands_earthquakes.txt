The 1971 Solomon Islands earthquakes occurred in the northern part of the Solomon Islands, within Papua New Guinea as a doublet earthquake. [CLS] [SEP] The first large shock occurred on July 14 at 06:11 UTC with a magnitude of Mw 8.0. [CLS] [SEP] The second large event occurred on July 26 at 01:23 UTC with a magnitude of Mw 8.1. [CLS] [SEP] The initial event on July 14 caused a tsunami, which was observed in Rabaul. [CLS] [SEP] The earthquake of July 26 triggered a tsunami with a 3.4 m (11 ft) runup in New Britain.Shallow, large thrust earthquakes in the Solomon Islands tend to occur in multiplets. [CLS] [SEP] Examples of such earthquakes include the doublets occurred in 1971, 1974, and 1975. [CLS] [SEP] The 1971 doublet occurred at the junction of two trenches. [CLS] [SEP] The July 14 earthquake is located in the northwestern Solomon Islands Trench, while the July 26 earthquake ruptured the northeastern New Britain Trench. [CLS] [SEP] The July 14 earthquake and the July 26 earthquake were caused by the subduction of the Solomon Sea Plate beneath the Pacific Plate and the Bismark Sea Plate, respectively. [CLS] [SEP] The 1971 sequence had the largest earthquake in 50 years in this region as it occurred. [CLS] [SEP]
