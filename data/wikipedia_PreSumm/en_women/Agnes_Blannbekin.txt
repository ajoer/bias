[CLS] Agnes Blannbekin (; c. [SEP] [CLS] 1244 â€“ March 10, 1315), was an Austrian Beguine and Christian mystic. [SEP] [CLS] She was also referred to as Saint Agnes Blannbekin or the Venerable Agnes Blannbekin, though never beatified or canonized by the Roman Catholic Church. [SEP] [CLS] Her revelations were compiled by an anonymous confessor before being transcribed by the monk Ermenrich and later published in 1731 as Venerabilis Agnetis Blannbekin. [SEP] [CLS] The copies were confiscated by the Society of Jesus, and only two manuscripts survived. [SEP] [CLS] One was destroyed in a fire at the Strasbourg library in 1870. [SEP] [CLS] The surviving manuscript, currently owned by a Cistercian convent in Zwettl, Austria, was not released until the 20th century. [SEP] [CLS] Although Blannbekin is best remembered today for her visions, during her life she was known for her ministry to the urban population and her strange and provocative expressions of faith.
