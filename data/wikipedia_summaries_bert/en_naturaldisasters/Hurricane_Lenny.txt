Hurricane Lenny is the second-strongest November Atlantic hurricane on record, behind the 1932 Cuba hurricane. [CLS] [SEP] It was the twelfth tropical storm, eighth hurricane, and record-breaking fifth Category 4 hurricane in the 1999 Atlantic hurricane season. [CLS] [SEP] Lenny formed on November 13 in the western Caribbean Sea and maintained an unprecedented west-to-east track for its entire duration, which made it earn the nickname, "Wrong Way Lenny". [CLS] [SEP] It attained hurricane status south of Jamaica on November 15 and passed south of Hispaniola and Puerto Rico over the next few days. [CLS] [SEP] Lenny rapidly intensified over the northeastern Caribbean on November 17, attaining peak winds of 155 mph (249 km/h) about 21 mi (34 km) south of Saint Croix in the United States Virgin Islands. [CLS] [SEP] It gradually weakened while moving through the Leeward Islands, eventually dissipating on November 23 over the open Atlantic Ocean. [CLS] [SEP] Before moving through the Lesser Antilles, Lenny produced rough surf that killed two people in northern Colombia. [CLS] [SEP] Strong winds and rainfall resulted in heavy crop damage in southeastern Puerto Rico. [CLS] [SEP] Despite the hurricane's passage near Saint Croix at peak intensity, damage on the small island was only described as "moderate", although there was widespread flooding and erosion. [CLS] [SEP] Damage in the United States territories totaled about $330 million. [CLS] [SEP] The highest precipitation total was 34.12 in (867 mm) at the police station on the French side of Saint Martin. [CLS] [SEP] On the island, the hurricane killed three people and destroyed more than 200 properties. [CLS] [SEP] In nearby Antigua and Barbuda, the hurricane killed one person; torrential rainfall there contaminated the local water supply. [CLS] [SEP] Significant storm damage occurred as far south as Grenada, where high surf isolated towns from the capital city. [CLS] [SEP]
