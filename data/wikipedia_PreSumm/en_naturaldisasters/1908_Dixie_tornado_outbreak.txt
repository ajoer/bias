[CLS] The 1908 Dixie tornado outbreak was a destructive tornado outbreak that affected portions of the Great Plains, the Midwest, and the Southern United States from April 23â€“25, 1908. [SEP] [CLS] The outbreak produced at least 29 tornadoes in 13 states, with a total of at least 324 tornado-related deaths. [SEP] [CLS] Of these deaths, 83% were caused by three tornadoes which have been posthumously rated violent F4s on the modern Fujita scale. [SEP] [CLS] These three tornadoes, each of them probably a tornado family, left a cumulative path length of at least 265 miles (426 km) and injured at least 1,358 people, yet caused only 84 of their deaths in cities: most of the deaths were in rural areas, often African American, and consequently may have been undercounted. [SEP] [CLS] One of the three deadliest tornadoes in the outbreak occurred on the same day, April 24, as that of the other two; reportedly attained a maximum width of at least 2 miles (3.2 km) or larger; and killed a minimum of 143 people along its path, at least 73 (51%) of them in the U.S. [SEP] [CLS] state of Mississippi. [SEP] [CLS] The 73 deaths made the tornado the third deadliest in Mississippi history, following the 1936 Tupelo F5, with 216 deaths, and the 1840 Natchez tornado (317 deaths).In addition to the Purvis tornado, the outbreak generated five other violent tornadoes in two days. [SEP] [CLS] The first two of these struck in Nebraska and Texas on April 23, collectively killing four people. [SEP] [CLS] The remaining three developed in Louisiana and Alabama the next day. [SEP] [CLS] A large and intense, pre-dawn tornado began early in the morning southeast of Alexandria, Louisiana, and produced a devastating path of damage into Concordia Parish and thence into Mississippi, killing 91 people. [SEP] [CLS] Another tornado developed in the afternoon over Northern Alabama, moving diagonally to the northeast and killing 35 people in rural areas. [SEP] [CLS] The final of the three F4s on April 24 hit extreme East Alabama and crossed into West Georgia, killing 11 people and leveling small homes. [SEP] [CLS] Besides these tornadoes, one other tornado killed at least 10 people in Georgia. [SEP] [CLS] The 1908 Dixie outbreak is tied with the 2011 Super Outbreak for fourth-deadliest continuous tornado outbreak in American history and April 24 is the only single day in United States history to have two separate tornadoes kill 90 people or more.
