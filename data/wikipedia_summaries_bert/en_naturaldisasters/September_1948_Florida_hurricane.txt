The September 1948 Florida hurricane was the most intense tropical cyclone to make landfall in the state since the 1935 Labor Day hurricane. [CLS] [SEP] The fourth hurricane and third major hurricane of the season, this storm developed from a tropical wave over the Caribbean Sea on September 18. [CLS] [SEP] Early the next day, the system strengthened into a hurricane while moving westward passing close to Grand Cayman, Cayman Islands. [CLS] [SEP] Thereafter, it curved northwestward and continued to deepen. [CLS] [SEP] By September 20, the system turned northward and later that day made landfall in Zapata Peninsula, Cuba as a Category 3 hurricane on the modern day Saffir–Simpson hurricane wind scale. [CLS] [SEP] Another landfall occurred in Cuba early the next day to the south of Güines. [CLS] [SEP] Severe destruction was reported on the island, with winds up to 90 mph (140 km/h) observed in Havana. [CLS] [SEP] Over 700 buildings were destroyed. [CLS] [SEP] Ten deaths occurred and damage totaled at least $2 million (1948 USD), while other sources estimate "several million dollars." After emerging into the Straits of Florida on September 21, the storm resumed intensification, before striking near Boca Chica Key, Florida with winds of 120 mph (195 km/h). [CLS] [SEP] By early on September 22, the system peaked as a Category 4 hurricane with maximum sustained winds of 130 mph (215 km/h). [CLS] [SEP] Shortly thereafter, another landfall occurred near Chokoloskee, Florida at the same intensity. [CLS] [SEP] Severe damage was reported in the state due to strong winds. [CLS] [SEP] The storm was considered the worst in Key West since the 1919 Florida Keys hurricane. [CLS] [SEP] Throughout the state, 1,200 homes were severely damaged or destroyed, while 40 businesses were demolished and 237 suffered impact. [CLS] [SEP] Throughout Florida, there were three fatalities and approximately $12 million (1948 USD) in damage, over half of which was inflicted on crops.
