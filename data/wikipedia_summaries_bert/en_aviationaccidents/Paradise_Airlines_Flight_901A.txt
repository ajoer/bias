Paradise Airlines Flight 901A was a scheduled flight from San Jose, California, to South Lake Tahoe, California, that crashed near Genoa Peak, on the eastern side of Lake Tahoe, on March 1, 1964. [CLS] [SEP] The crash resulted in the deaths of all 85 people aboard the Lockheed L-049 Constellation and the destruction of the plane. [CLS] [SEP] An investigation concluded that the primary cause of the accident was the pilot's attempt to perform a visual landing approach under adverse weather conditions. [CLS] [SEP] The pilot had aborted the landing attempt and was not aware of his actual location while flying below the minimum safe altitude in mountainous terrain. [CLS] [SEP] He was likely attempting to divert to the airport in Reno, Nevada, by flying through a wide pass in the mountains, but crashed into the left shoulder of the pass. [CLS] [SEP] At the time, it was the second worst single-plane crash in United States history, and remains the worst accident involving the Lockheed L-049 Constellation. [CLS] [SEP] The airline operating the flight, Paradise Airlines, was a two-year-old company that operated discount excursion flights from the San Francisco Bay Area to Lake Tahoe. [CLS] [SEP] After the accident, investigators from the Federal Aviation Administration (FAA) discovered multiple safety violations by the airline company and grounded all of its flights. [CLS] [SEP] After an unsuccessful appeal by the company, the FAA revoked the airline's operating certificate and Paradise Airlines permanently ceased operations. [CLS] [SEP]
