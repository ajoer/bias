The Fokker F27 Friendship is a turboprop airliner developed and manufactured by the Dutch aircraft manufacturer Fokker. [CLS] [SEP] It is the most numerous post-war aircraft manufactured in the Netherlands; the F27 was also one of the most successful European airliners of its era. [CLS] [SEP] The F27 was developed during the early 1950s with the intent of producing a capable successor to the earlier piston engine-powered airliners that had become commonplace on the market, such as the Douglas DC-3. [CLS] [SEP] A key innovation of the F27 was the adoption of the Rolls-Royce Dart turboprop engine, which produced substantially less vibration and noise which provided improved conditions for passengers; another major comfort feature was cabin pressurisation. [CLS] [SEP] Innovative manufacturing techniques were also employed in the aircraft's construction. [CLS] [SEP] On 24 November 1955, the F27 made its maiden flight; on 19 November 1958, the type was introduced to revenue service. [CLS] [SEP] Shortly after its introduction, the F27 was recognised as being a commercial success. [CLS] [SEP] Under a licensing arrangement reached between Fokker and the U.S. [CLS] [SEP] aircraft manufacturer Fairchild, the F27 was manufactured in the United States by the latter; Fairchild went on to independently develop a stretched version of the airliner, which was designated as the Fairchild FH-227. [CLS] [SEP] During the 1980s, Fokker developed a modernised successor to the F27, the Fokker 50, which eventually replaced it in production. [CLS] [SEP]
