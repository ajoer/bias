[CLS] Pope Pius VIII (20 November 1761 â€“ 30 November 1830), born Francesco Saverio Maria Felice Castiglioni, was head of the Catholic Church and ruler of the Papal States from 31 March 1829 to his death in 1830. [SEP] [CLS] Pius VIII's pontificate was the shortest of the 19th century, and is likely the least remembered. [SEP] [CLS] His brief papacy witnessed the Catholic Emancipation in Great Britain in 1829, which he welcomed, and the July Revolution in France in 1830, which he reluctantly accepted. [SEP] [CLS] Pius VIII is often remembered for his writings on marriages between Catholics and Protestants in the 1830 encyclical Litteris altero abhinc, in which he declared that a marriage could only be properly blessed if proper provisions had been made to ensure the bringing up of children in the Catholic faith. [SEP] [CLS] His death less than two years after his election to the papacy has led to speculation of a possible murder. [SEP] [CLS]
