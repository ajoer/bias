[CLS] David William Donald Cameron (born 9 October 1966) is a British Conservative Party politician who served as Prime Minister of the United Kingdom from 2010 to 2016. [SEP] [CLS] He was the Member of Parliament (MP) for Witney from 2001 to 2016 and leader of the Conservative Party from 2005 to 2016. [SEP] [CLS] He identifies as a one-nation conservative, and has been associated with both economically liberal and socially liberal policies. [SEP] [CLS] Born in London to an upper-middle-class family, Cameron was educated at Heatherdown School, Eton College, and Brasenose College, Oxford. [SEP] [CLS] From 1988 to 1993 he worked at the Conservative Research Department, latterly assisting the Conservative Prime Minister John Major, before leaving politics to work for Carlton Communications in 1994. [SEP] [CLS] Becoming an MP in 2001, he served in the opposition shadow cabinet under Conservative leader Michael Howard, and succeeded Howard in 2005. [SEP] [CLS] Cameron sought to rebrand the Conservatives, embracing an increasingly socially liberal position. [SEP] [CLS] Following the 2010 general election, negotiations led to Cameron becoming Prime Minister as the head of a coalition government with the Liberal Democrats â€“ the youngest holder of the office since the 1810s. [SEP] [CLS] His premiership was marked by the ongoing effects of the late-2000s financial crisis; these involved a large deficit in government finances that his government sought to reduce through austerity measures. [SEP] [CLS] His administration introduced large-scale changes to welfare, immigration policy, education, and healthcare, and oversaw the 2012 London Olympics. [SEP] [CLS] It privatised the Royal Mail and some other state assets, and legalised same-sex marriage in England and Wales. [SEP] [CLS] Internationally, his government intervened militarily in the Libyan Civil War and later authorised the bombing of the Islamic State of Iraq and the Levant; domestically, his government oversaw the referendum on voting reform and Scottish independence referendum, both of which confirmed Cameron's favoured outcome. [SEP] [CLS] When the Conservatives secured an unexpected majority in the 2015 general election he remained as Prime Minister, this time leading a Conservative-only government. [SEP] [CLS] To fulfil a manifesto pledge, he introduced a referendum on the UK's continuing membership of the EU. [SEP] [CLS] Cameron supported continued membership; following the success of the Leave vote, he resigned to make way for a new Prime Minister and was succeeded by Theresa May. [SEP] [CLS] Cameron is currently the President of Alzheimer's Research UK since 2017. [SEP] [CLS] Cameron has been praised for modernising the Conservative Party and for decreasing the United Kingdom's national deficit. [SEP] [CLS] However, he has been the target of criticism surrounding his decision to hold the referendum on Britain's membership of the EU which led to a period of political instability in the UK during the late 2010s. [SEP] [CLS] He has also been criticised by figures on both the left and right, and has been accused of elitism and political opportunism. [SEP] [CLS]
