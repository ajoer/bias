[CLS] Patricia G. [SEP] [CLS] Selinger is an American computer scientist and IBM Fellow, best known for her work on relational database management systems. [SEP] [CLS] She played a fundamental role in the development of System R, a pioneering relational database implementation, and wrote the canonical paper on relational query optimization. [SEP] [CLS] She is a pioneer in relational database management and inventor of the technique of cost-based query optimization. [SEP] [CLS] She was a key member of the original System R team that created the first relational database research prototype. [SEP] [CLS] The dynamic programming algorithm for determining join order proposed in that paper still forms the basis for most of the query optimizers used in modern relational systems. [SEP] [CLS] She also established and led IBM’s Database Technology Institute, considered one of the most successful examples of a fast technology pipeline from research to development and personally has technical contributions in the areas of database optimization, data parallelism, distributed data, and unstructured data management. [SEP] [CLS] Before her retirement from IBM, she was the Vice President of Data Management Architecture and Technology at IBM. [SEP] [CLS] Dr. [SEP] [CLS] Selinger was appointed an IBM Fellow in 1994, IBM’s highest technical recognition, and is an ACM Fellow (2009), a member of the National Academy of Engineering (1997), and a Fellow of the American Academy of Arts and Sciences. [SEP] [CLS] Dr. [SEP] [CLS] Selinger has published more than 40 papers, and also received the ACM Systems Software Award for her work on System R. [SEP] [CLS] She received the SIGMOD Innovation Award in 2002, the highest ACM award given in the area of data management.She received A.B. [SEP] [CLS] (1971), S.M. [SEP] [CLS] (1972), and Ph.D. [SEP] [CLS] (1975) degrees in applied mathematics from Harvard University.From 2014 through 2016, Dr. [SEP] [CLS] Selinger was the Chief Technology Officer at Paradata (Paradata.io) where she worked on challenging problems in data harmonization, curation, provenance, and entity resolution to provide transparency to the supply chain. [SEP] [CLS] Paradata technology transforms real-time data into verified insights and executable actions. [SEP] [CLS] Beginning in 2017, Dr. [SEP] [CLS] Selinger is a Principal Architect at Salesforce.com. [SEP] [CLS]
