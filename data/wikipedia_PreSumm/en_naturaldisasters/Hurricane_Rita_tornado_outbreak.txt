[CLS] The Hurricane Rita tornado outbreak was a significant tropical cyclone-produced tornado outbreak and severe weather event that resulted from the remnants of Hurricane Rita in late-September 2005. [SEP] [CLS] The event was the fourth-largest tornado outbreak caused by a tropical cyclone in recorded history. [SEP] [CLS] After the hurricane made landfall on the extreme southwestern coast of Louisiana on September 24, the tropical cyclone's strong rainbands affected much of the West South Central and East South Central States, producing heavy rainfall in addition to numerous tornadoes. [SEP] [CLS] Tornadic activity was distributed roughly evenly from September 24â€“25, though activity shifted slightly eastward on September 25. [SEP] [CLS] The severe activity ended by September 26, by which time the remnants of Hurricane Rita were absorbed by a frontal boundary. [SEP] [CLS] As a result of Hurricane Rita, 98 tornadoes were confirmed over nearly a two-day period. [SEP] [CLS] Most of the tornadoes occurred in Mississippi, where 49 tornadoes were confirmed. [SEP] [CLS] The strongest tornado throughout the outbreak was an F3 tornado which struck areas of southeastern Louisiana late on September 24, injuring three people. [SEP] [CLS] Despite the large number of tornadoes, only one death resulted, which occurred as a result of an F1 tornado in Mississippi on September 24. [SEP] [CLS] However, another F1 tornado near Starkville, Mississippi injured seven people on September 25 making it the tornado with the most injuries during the outbreak. [SEP] [CLS] The same tornado was also the costliest, causing $2 million in damages. [SEP] [CLS] Overall, tornadoes during the outbreak killed one person and injured 23, and caused $18.373 million in damages. [SEP] [CLS]
