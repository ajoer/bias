Jorightu Khan (Yesüder?) (Mongolian: Зоригт хаан; Chinese: 也速迭兒; 1358–1392) was a Mongol Khagan of the Northern Yuan dynasty based in Mongolia. [CLS] [SEP] There are questions about the identity of Jorightu: some scholars believe that Jorightu was Yesüder who was a descendant of Ariq Böke and that Engke Khan was Yesüder's son succeeding him, while other believe that the two were the same person with different titles. [CLS] [SEP] His title or name "Jorightu Khagan" means "Brave King" in the Mongolian language. [CLS] [SEP] After the murder of Uskhal Khan by Yesüder, the Mongols quickly disintegrated. [CLS] [SEP] Gunashiri, a descendant of Chagatai Khan, founded his own small state Qara Del in Hami. [CLS] [SEP] Uskhal Khan's former minister, Necelai, submitted to Ming China in 1389 and the Ming established a Mongol guard of Tyuanin (also known as Three Guards) under him in Daiying, modern Inner Mongolia. [CLS] [SEP] However, the late khan's chingsang, Shirmen, allied with Yesüder, killed Necelai. [CLS] [SEP] The former prince of Liaodang and one of the leaders of the Three Guards, Ajashir, threw his allegiance to Yesüder some time after 1389. [CLS] [SEP] In 1392, the Ming army invaded Mongolia and captured many cattle and men and Jorightu Khan most likely died in the battle. [CLS] [SEP]
