Mahieu le Juif was an Old French trouvère. [CLS] [SEP] His name means "Matthew the Jew" and, if his own songs are to be believed, he was a convert from Judaism to Christianity. [CLS] [SEP] Only two of his songs survive, one with a melody. [CLS] [SEP] He has been conflated with Mahieu de Gant, but the same manuscript that contains both their works clearly distinguishes them. [CLS] [SEP] Mahieu's more popular song, Par grant franchise, was very widely copied and today it exists in twelve chansonniers, including one in Occitan. [CLS] [SEP] It was probably the subject of the song that accounts for its popularity. [CLS] [SEP] Mahieu abandoned the faith of the Jews for that of his Christian lady. [CLS] [SEP] Expecting to receive praise, however, he got only ridicule. [CLS] [SEP] The apropos melody of this song survives in many variations, but all are of a simple, yet tight, structure. [CLS] [SEP] There is intertextual similarity between a piece of the troubadour Albertet de Sestaro and Par grant, but the direction of any influence of the one on the other cannot be ascertained: though Jeanroy thought the trouvère was influenced by the troubadour. [CLS] [SEP] Mahieu's other piece, Pour autrui movrai, likewise refers to his Jewishness, but it was not as widely read. [CLS] [SEP]
