[CLS] Hurricane Kiko was one of the strongest tropical cyclones to have hit the eastern coast of Mexico's Baja California peninsula during recorded history. [SEP] [CLS] The eleventh named storm of the 1989 Pacific hurricane season, Kiko formed out of a large mesoscale convective system on August 25. [SEP] [CLS] Slowly tracking northwestward, the storm rapidly intensified into a hurricane early the next day. [SEP] [CLS] Strengthening continued until early August 27, when Kiko reached its peak intensity with winds of 120 mph (195 km/h). [SEP] [CLS] The storm turned west at this time, and at around 0600 UTC, the storm made landfall near Punta Arena at the southern tip of Baja California Sur. [SEP] [CLS] The hurricane rapidly weakened into a tropical storm later that day and further into a tropical depression by August 28, shortly after entering the Pacific Ocean. [SEP] [CLS] The depression persisted for another day while tracking southward, before being absorbed by nearby Tropical Storm Lorena. [SEP] [CLS] Though Kiko made landfall as a Category 3 hurricane, its impact was relatively minor. [SEP] [CLS] Press reports indicated that 20 homes were destroyed and numerous highways were flooded by torrential rains. [SEP] [CLS]
