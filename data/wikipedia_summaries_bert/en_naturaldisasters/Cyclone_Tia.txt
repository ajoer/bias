[CLS] Severe Tropical Cyclone Tia was the first of six tropical cyclones to affect Vanuatu during the 1991–92 South Pacific cyclone season. [SEP] [CLS] The system was first noted within the South Pacific convergence zone as a small tropical depression on November 13, to the northeast of the Solomon Islands. [SEP] [CLS] Over the next few days the system gradually developed further within an area of light winds in the upper troposphere, before it was named Tia early on November 16. [SEP] [CLS] Later that day due to a developing northerly steering current, the system slowed and undertook a small anticlockwise loop before starting to move towards the southwest and rapidly intensify. [SEP] [CLS] After rapidly intensifying throughout November 16 and 17, Tia passed within 55 km (35 mi) of the Solomon Island: Anuta at around 1800 UTC on November 17, before passing near Tikopia Island six hours later. [SEP] [CLS] As Tia moved near Tikopia, the system reached its peak intensity as a category 3 severe tropical cyclone, with 10‑minute sustained windspeeds of 140 km/h (85 mph). [SEP] [CLS] During November 18, due to cooler waters and increased wind shear, Tia started to weaken as it moved southwards under the influence of a strengthening upper-level northerly wind flow. [SEP] [CLS] Over the next 24 hours, the system continued to move southwards and passed within 150 km (95 mi) of Vanuatu's Banks Islands, while gradually weakening further. [SEP] [CLS] Tia subsequently degenerated into a tropical depression during November 20, before it was last noted the next day as it crossed a part of its former track, where it had been producing hurricane-force wind speeds a few days earlier. [SEP] [CLS] While it was active Tia directly affected the Solomon Islands and Vanuatu, while it indirectly affected Kiribati. [SEP] [CLS] The Solomon Island of Tikopia was the worst affected island, after more than 1,000 people were left homeless on the island and 90% of all dwellings were destroyed. [SEP] [CLS] Damage was minimal in Vanuatu, and was mainly confined to crops and fruit trees on the Banks and Torres Islands. [SEP] [CLS] After this usage of the name Tia, the name was retired and withdrawn from use on the tropical cyclone naming lists. [SEP] [CLS]
