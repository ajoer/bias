Typhoon Kinna, known in the Philippines as Typhoon Neneng, was a mid-season typhoon that struck Japan during 1991. [CLS] [SEP] An area of disturbed weather formed within the Western Pacific monsoon trough during early September 1991. [CLS] [SEP] The disturbance was upgraded into a tropical depression on September 10 after an increase in organization. [CLS] [SEP] Tracking northwest due to a weak subtropical ridge to its north, the depression strengthened into a tropical storm at 00:00 UTC on September 11. [CLS] [SEP] Later that day, Kinna was upgraded into a severe tropical storm. [CLS] [SEP] Following the development of a poorly defined eye, Kinna was upgraded into a typhoon on September 12. [CLS] [SEP] The cyclone turned north in response to a trough and passed through Okinawa as a minimal typhoon. [CLS] [SEP] Typhoon Kinna obtained peak intensity on September 13, but thereafter, Kinna accelerated north-northeastward toward Kyushu, passing over the island that day at peak intensity. [CLS] [SEP] Typhoon Kinna rapidly transitioned into an extratropical low as it tracked along the northern coast of Honshu. [CLS] [SEP] Its extratropical remnants were last noted on the evening of September 16. [CLS] [SEP] Even though most of the damage occurred on Kyushu and on western Honshu, the typhoon was the most destructive tropical cyclone to strike Okinawa since 1987, and was also the first of typhoon intensity to pass directly over the island since Typhoon Vera in 1986. [CLS] [SEP] Nationwide, 11 people were killed and 94 others suffered injuries. [CLS] [SEP] Nearly 50,000 customers lost power. [CLS] [SEP] Close to 150 domestic flights were cancelled, which left 26,000 travelers stranded. [CLS] [SEP] A total of 382 houses were destroyed while 2,586 others were flooded. [CLS] [SEP] There were 213 landslides and 9 bridges were washed out. [CLS] [SEP] Nearly 70 ships along with 47 roads and 875 ha (2,160 acres) of farmland were damaged. [CLS] [SEP] In all, damage was estimated at Â¥51.1 billion (1991 US$383 million). [CLS] [SEP]
