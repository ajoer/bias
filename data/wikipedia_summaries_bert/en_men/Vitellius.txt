Vitellius (; Aulus Vitellius Germanicus; Latin: [ˈau̯lʊs wɪˈtɛllɪ.ʊs]; 24 September 15 – 22 December 69 AD) was Roman emperor for eight months, from 16 April to 22 December 69 AD. [CLS] [SEP] Vitellius was proclaimed emperor following the quick succession of the previous emperors Galba and Otho, in a year of civil war known as the Year of the Four Emperors. [CLS] [SEP] Vitellius was the first to add the honorific cognomen Germanicus to his name instead of Caesar upon his accession. [CLS] [SEP] Like his direct predecessor, Otho, Vitellius attempted to rally public support to his cause by honoring and imitating Nero who remained widely popular in the empire. [CLS] [SEP] His claim to the throne was soon challenged by legions stationed in the eastern provinces, who proclaimed their commander Vespasian emperor instead. [CLS] [SEP] War ensued, leading to a crushing defeat for Vitellius at the Second Battle of Bedriacum in northern Italy. [CLS] [SEP] Once he realised his support was wavering, Vitellius prepared to abdicate in favor of Vespasian. [CLS] [SEP] He was not allowed to do so by his supporters, resulting in a brutal battle for Rome between Vitellius' forces and the armies of Vespasian. [CLS] [SEP] He was executed in Rome by Vespasian's soldiers on 22 December 69. [CLS] [SEP]
