The 1944 Jamaica hurricane was a deadly major hurricane that swept across the Caribbean Sea and Gulf of Mexico in August 1944. [CLS] [SEP] Conservative estimates placed the storm's death toll at 116. [CLS] [SEP] The storm was already well-developed when it was first noted passing westward over the Windward Islands into the Caribbean Sea on August 16. [CLS] [SEP] A ship near Grenada with 74 occupants was lost, constituting a plurality of the deaths associated with the storm. [CLS] [SEP] The following day, the storm intensified into a hurricane, reaching its peak strength on August 20 with maximum sustained winds of 120 mph (195 km/h). [CLS] [SEP] At this intensity, the major hurricane made landfall on Jamaica later that day, traversing the length of the island. [CLS] [SEP] The damage wrought was extensive, with the strong winds destroying 90 percent of banana trees and 41 percent of coconut trees in Jamaica; the overall damage toll was estimated at "several millions of dollars". [CLS] [SEP] The northern coast of Jamaica saw the most severe damage, with widespread structural damage and numerous homes destroyed across several parishes. [CLS] [SEP] In Port Maria, the storm was considered the worst since 1903. [CLS] [SEP] Land interaction weakened the hurricane, and the storm maintained this lessened intensity as it passed the Cayman Islands, producing measured gusts of 80–90 mph (130–140 km/h). [CLS] [SEP] On August 22, the hurricane moved ashore the Yucatán Peninsula near Cozumel and eventually emerged into the Bay of Campeche as a tropical storm. [CLS] [SEP] On August 24, the storm made landfall for a final time near Tampico, Mexico, bringing with it heavy rains that caused flooding throughout the coasts of Veracruz and Texas, killing 12. [CLS] [SEP] The storm dissipated over the mountainous terrain of inland Mexico later that day. [CLS] [SEP] Heavy rains were reported across the Rio Grande Valley, causing minor flooding. [CLS] [SEP] A tornado produced by the storms killed one person in McCook, Texas and injured fifteen others. [CLS] [SEP]
