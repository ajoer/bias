Widerøe Flight 710, commonly known as the Torghatten Accident (Norwegian: Torghatten-ulykken), was a controlled flight into terrain into the mountain of Torghatten in Brønnøy, Norway. [CLS] [SEP] The Widerøe-operated de Havilland Canada Dash 7 crashed on 6 May 1988 at 20:29:30 during approach to Brønnøysund Airport, Brønnøy. [CLS] [SEP] All thirty-six people on board LN-WFN were killed; the crash remains the deadliest accident of the Dash 7 and in Northern Norway. [CLS] [SEP] The direct cause of the accident was that the aircraft had descended from 500 meters to 170 meters (1,500–550 ft) at 8 nautical miles (15 km; 9.2 mi) instead of 4 nautical miles (7.4 km; 4.6 mi) from the airport. [CLS] [SEP] An investigation found several shortcomings in the airline's operating procedures, in particular lack of proper cockpit communication and mutual control of the descent and approach plans. [CLS] [SEP] This was in part caused by the airline electing to not follow the Sterile Cockpit Rule and that a passenger was sitting in a cockpit jump seat during the flight. [CLS] [SEP] The investigating commission also found lack of proper pilot training in the airline. [CLS] [SEP] Flight 710 was the second of four Widerøe accidents between 1982 and 1993, all of which revealed shortcomings in the airline's operations and internal control. [CLS] [SEP]
