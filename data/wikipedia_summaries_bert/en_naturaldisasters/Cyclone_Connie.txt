Cyclone Connie was a strong tropical cyclone that affected both Mauritius and Réunion in late January 2000. [CLS] [SEP] On January 24, 2000, a tropical disturbance developed well east of Madagascar. [CLS] [SEP] Despite moderate wind shear, it gradually strengthened while stalling offshore, and late on January 25, was believed to have attained tropical storm status. [CLS] [SEP] After turning generally southeast, Connie attained cyclone intensity on January 27. [CLS] [SEP] Rapid intensification ensued. [CLS] [SEP] Shortly after developing a well-defined eye, Connie attained peak intensity at 0000 UTC on January 28 as an intense tropical cyclone. [CLS] [SEP] Thereafter, Connie slowly weakened due to increased wind shear as thunderstorm activity quickly diminished around the eye. [CLS] [SEP] After threatening Mauritius, Connie then turned southwest, passing very close to Réunion late on January 28. [CLS] [SEP] After briefly leveling off in intensity that evening, Connie soon became less organized, and midday on January 29, the eye became less defined. [CLS] [SEP] The next day, Connie weakened to a severe tropical storm. [CLS] [SEP] Despite forecasts of additional weakening, Connie maintained its intensity for most of January 31. [CLS] [SEP] However, weakening resumed on February 1 and the storm transitioned to an extratropical cyclone on February 2. [CLS] [SEP] Two days later, Connie merged with another low-pressure area. [CLS] [SEP] Despite passing well offshore Mauritius, both the airport and the port were closed due to lack of certainty in the storm's path. [CLS] [SEP] Connie brought several days of heavy rains and gusty winds to the island. [CLS] [SEP] One person was killed there and power was briefly disconnected. [CLS] [SEP] Overall, damage on Mauritius was minor. [CLS] [SEP] While passing near Reunion, Cyclone Connie brought heavy rains to the island nation. [CLS] [SEP] Power was knocked out to around 40,000 individuals. [CLS] [SEP] Roughly 100 homes were destroyed, leaving 600 people were homeless. [CLS] [SEP] Another 300 sought shelter. [CLS] [SEP] Two people were killed, but damage in Reunion was minimal. [CLS] [SEP] The extratropical remnants of the system later brought flooding to Mozambique, where 20,000 people were listed as homeless. [CLS] [SEP]
