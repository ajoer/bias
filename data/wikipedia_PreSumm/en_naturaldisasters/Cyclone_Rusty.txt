[CLS] Severe Tropical Cyclone Rusty was a strong, slow-moving tropical cyclone that produced record duration gale-force winds in Port Hedland, Western Australia in late February 2013. [SEP] [CLS] Originating as an area of low pressure on 22 February well to the northwest of the Kimberley region of Western Australia, the precursor to Rusty steadily developed within a favourable environment. [SEP] [CLS] Gradually decreasing surface pressures in the region signaled intensification and the low was classified as Tropical Cyclone Rusty on 23 February. [SEP] [CLS] Although a large, sprawling system, near-record high sea surface temperatures enabled Rusty to quickly deepen. [SEP] [CLS] Becoming essentially stationary on 25 February, the system acquired hurricane-force winds as its core improved in structure. [SEP] [CLS] The cyclone achieved its peak intensity two days later with maximum ten-minute sustained winds of 165 km/h (105 mph) and a barometric pressure of 944 hPa (mbar; 27.88 inHg). [SEP] [CLS] Thereafter, interaction with land caused its core to collapse before the system made landfall near Pardoo Station. [SEP] [CLS] Rusty weakened below cyclone strength on 28 February. [SEP] [CLS] Its remnants persisted over Western Australia for several more days before being absorbed into an extratropical cyclone on 5 March. [SEP] [CLS] Owing to the slow-moving nature of Rusty, a large swath of coastal Western Australia saw heavy rains from the storm with a storm peak of 374 mm (14.7 in) at De Grey Station. [SEP] [CLS] Substantial flooding took place accordingly; the De Grey River crested just shy of its all-time record at 17.23 m (56.5 ft). [SEP] [CLS] Some structural damage took place, but the predominant effects of the storm were sustained by agriculture and infrastructure. [SEP] [CLS] Economic losses related to the storm exceeds A$500 million (US$510 million). [SEP] [CLS] The name Rusty was later retired, replaced with Riordan in 2016. [SEP] [CLS]
