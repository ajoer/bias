This is a list of large earthquakes that have occurred in New Zealand. [CLS] [SEP] Only earthquakes with a magnitude of 6.0 or greater are listed, except for a few that had a moderate impact. [CLS] [SEP] Aftershocks are not included, unless they were of great significance or contributed to a death toll, such as the M 6.3 2011 Christchurch earthquake and the M 7.3 aftershock to the 1931 Hawke's Bay earthquake. [CLS] [SEP] Earthquakes occur frequently in New Zealand as the country is situated in the collision zone between the Indo-Australian and Pacific tectonic plates, part of the Pacific Basin Ring of Fire, where many earthquakes and volcanoes occur. [CLS] [SEP] Most events occur along the main ranges running from Fiordland in the southwest to East Cape in the northeast. [CLS] [SEP] This axis follows the boundary between the Indo-Australian and Pacific plates. [CLS] [SEP] Large earthquakes are less common along the central Alpine Fault, where the plates are not subducting and the forces are accommodated in different ways. [CLS] [SEP] The largest city within the highest-risk zone is the nation's capital, Wellington, followed by Hastings then Napier. [CLS] [SEP] All these cities have experienced severe earthquakes since European settlement. [CLS] [SEP] About 14,000 earthquakes occur in and around the country each year, of which between 150 and 200 are big enough to be felt. [CLS] [SEP] As a result, New Zealand has very stringent building regulations. [CLS] [SEP] Quite early on, European settlers were faced with the reality of earthquakes in their new home. [CLS] [SEP] On 26 May 1840, the new settlement at Port Nicholson was struck by the first of a number of earthquakes and tremors. [CLS] [SEP] Early settlers learned fairly quickly the importance of using appropriate building methods in an earthquake-prone country. [CLS] [SEP] The 1848 earthquake, centred in Marlborough, caused great damage to the brick and masonry buildings in Wellington, and the city was rebuilt mainly in wood; consequently it suffered comparatively little damage in the 8.2 magnitude earthquake of 1855, which lifted the land 2â€“3m. [CLS] [SEP] Many buildings in Hastings and Napier were damaged in the 1931 Hawke's Bay earthquake. [CLS] [SEP] New building regulations meant that any new buildings constructed afterwards attempted to take earthquake shaking into account in building design. [CLS] [SEP]
