[CLS] [SEP] The first storm of the 2003 North Indian Ocean cyclone season, it developed over the Bay of Bengal on May 10.

[CLS] [SEP] The storm reached peak maximum sustained winds of 140 km/h (85 mph) on May 13, making it a very severe cyclonic storm according to the India Meteorological Department (IMD), which is the official Regional Specialized Meteorological Center for the basin. [CLS] [SEP] The cyclone drifted north over the central Bay of Bengal, gradually weakening due to heightened wind shear. [CLS] [SEP] Turning eastward, the storm deteriorated to a deep depression on May 16 before it curved northeastward and re-intensified into a cyclonic storm. [CLS] [SEP] It came ashore in western Myanmar and dissipated over land the following day.
