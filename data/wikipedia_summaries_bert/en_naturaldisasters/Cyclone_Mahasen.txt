Cyclonic Storm Viyaru, operationally known as Cyclonic Storm Mahasen, was a relatively weak tropical cyclone that caused loss of life across six countries in Southern and Southeastern Asia. [CLS] [SEP] Originating from an area of low pressure over the southern Bay of Bengal in early May 2013, Viyaru slowly consolidated into a depression on May 10. [CLS] [SEP] The depression gained forward momentum and attained gale-force winds on May 11 and was designated as Cyclonic Storm Viyaru, the first named storm of the season. [CLS] [SEP] Owing to adverse atmospheric conditions, the depression struggled to maintain organized convection as it moved closer to eastern India. [CLS] [SEP] On May 14, the exposed circulation of Viyaru turned northeastward. [CLS] [SEP] The following day, conditions again allowed for the storm to intensify. [CLS] [SEP] Early on May 16, the cyclone attained its peak intensity with winds of 85 km/h (50 mph) and a barometric pressure of 990 mbar (hPa; 29.23 inHg). [CLS] [SEP] Shortly thereafter Viyaru made landfall near Chittagong, Bangladesh. [CLS] [SEP] On May 17, it moved over the eastern Indian state of Nagaland. [CLS] [SEP] Early in the storm's existence, it brought flooding rains to much of northwestern Indonesia, resulting in significant damage. [CLS] [SEP] At least four people died and six others were reported missing. [CLS] [SEP] Offshore, a further 11 people went missing and were feared dead. [CLS] [SEP] In preparation for the storm, large-scale evacuations were recommended for parts of Myanmar. [CLS] [SEP] This resulted with people overcrowding boats to escape, and one or several vessels capsized, causing at least 39 deaths; 42 people were rescued while 19 others were unaccounted for and feared dead. [CLS] [SEP] The storm's expansive cloud mass also brought unsettled weather to Sri Lanka, Thailand, and southeastern India. [CLS] [SEP] Severe storms in India and Sri Lanka were responsible for at least 16 fatalities and significant damage; one person died in Thailand. [CLS] [SEP] Striking Bangladesh in a weaker state than initially expected, the storm caused moderate to severe damage. [CLS] [SEP] A total of 95,003 poorly constructed huts were damaged or destroyed, 17 people died, and nearly 1.3 million were affected across the country. [CLS] [SEP] Losses to crops reached à§³2.75 billion (US$35.3 million). [CLS] [SEP] Myanmar was spared damage and further casualties. [CLS] [SEP] Operationally, the storm was referred to as Mahasen; however, this stirred some controversy from nationalists and officials in Sri Lanka. [CLS] [SEP] They claimed that the name comes from King Mahasena of Anuradhapura who brought prosperity to the island, thus naming a destructive force of nature after him would be improper. [CLS] [SEP] As such, Sri Lankan agencies referred to the system as a nameless cyclone and requested that international agencies do the same. [CLS] [SEP] The name had been submitted to be used in the basin by Sri Lanka in 2003. [CLS] [SEP] The India Meteorological Department later renamed the system as Viyaru in their final reports and removed Mahasen from all previous archived advisories. [CLS] [SEP]
