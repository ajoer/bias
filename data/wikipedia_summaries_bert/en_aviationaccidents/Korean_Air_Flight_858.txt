Korean Air Flight 858 was a scheduled international passenger flight between Baghdad, Iraq and Seoul, South Korea. [CLS] [SEP] On 29 November 1987, the aircraft flying that route exploded in mid-air upon the detonation of a bomb planted inside an overhead storage bin in the airplane's passenger cabin by two North Korean agents. [CLS] [SEP] The agents, acting upon orders from the North Korean government, planted the device before disembarking from the aircraft during the first stop-over in Abu Dhabi, United Arab Emirates. [CLS] [SEP] While the aircraft was flying over the Andaman Sea to its second stop-over in Bangkok, Thailand, the bomb detonated and destroyed the Korean Air Boeing 707-3B5C. [CLS] [SEP] Everyone aboard the airliner perished, a total of 104 passengers and 11 crew members (almost all killed were South Koreans). [CLS] [SEP] The attack occurred 34 years after the Korean Armistice Agreement that ended the hostilities of the Korean War on 27 July 1953. [CLS] [SEP] The two bombers were traced to Bahrain, where they both took ampules of cyanide hidden in cigarettes when they realized they were about to be taken into custody. [CLS] [SEP] The man died, but the woman, Kim Hyon-hui, survived and later confessed to the bombing. [CLS] [SEP] She was sentenced to death after being put on trial for the attack, but was later pardoned by the President of South Korea, Roh Tae-woo, because it was deemed that she had been brainwashed in North Korea. [CLS] [SEP] Kim's testimony implicated Kim Jong-il, who at that time was the future leader of North Korea, as the person ultimately responsible for the incident. [CLS] [SEP] The United States Department of State specifically refers to the bombing of KAL 858 as a "terrorist act" and, except between 2008 and 2017, has included North Korea on its State Sponsors of Terrorism list. [CLS] [SEP] Since the attack, diplomatic relations between North Korea and South Korea have not significantly improved, although some progress has been made in the form of four Inter-Korean summits. [CLS] [SEP] Kim Hyon-hui later released a book, The Tears of My Soul, in which she recalled being trained in an espionage school run by the North Korean army, and being told personally by Kim Jong-il to carry out the attack. [CLS] [SEP] She was branded a traitor by North Korea, and became a critic of North Korea after seeing South Korea. [CLS] [SEP] Kim now resides in exile, and under constant tight security, fearing that the North Korean government wants to kill her. [CLS] [SEP] "Being a culprit I do have a sense of agony with which I must fight", she said at a press conference in 1990. [CLS] [SEP] "In that sense I must still be a prisoner or a captiveâ€”of a sense of guilt."
