[CLS] United Airlines Flight 266 was a scheduled flight from Los Angeles International Airport, California, to General Mitchell International Airport, Milwaukee, Wisconsin via Stapleton International Airport, Denver, Colorado with 38 on board. [SEP] [CLS] On January 18, 1969 at approximately 18:21 PST it crashed into Santa Monica Bay, Pacific Ocean, about 11.5 miles west of Los Angeles International Airport, four minutes after takeoff. [SEP] [CLS] Rescuers (at the time) speculated that an explosion occurred aboard the plane, a Boeing 727. [SEP] [CLS] Three and a half hours after the crash three bodies had been found in the ocean along with parts of fuselage and a United States mail bag carrying letters with that day's postmark. [SEP] [CLS] Hope was dim for survivors because the aircraft was configured for domestic flights and did not carry liferafts or lifejackets. [SEP] [CLS] A Coast Guard spokesman said it looked "very doubtful that there could be anybody alive."Up until 2013, United used "Flight 266" designation on its San Francisco-Chicago (O'Hare) route.
