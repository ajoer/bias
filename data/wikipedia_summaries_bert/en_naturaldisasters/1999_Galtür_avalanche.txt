The Galtür avalanche occurred on 23 February 1999 in the Alpine village of Galtür, Austria. [CLS] [SEP] It took less than 60 seconds to hit Galtür. [CLS] [SEP] At 50 metres (160 ft) high and traveling at 290 kilometres per hour (180 mph), this powder avalanche hit with great force, overturning cars, ruining buildings and burying 57 people. [CLS] [SEP] By the time rescue crews managed to arrive, 31 people – locals and tourists – had died. [CLS] [SEP] This avalanche was considered the worst Alpine avalanche in 40 years. [CLS] [SEP] Three major weather systems originating from the Atlantic accounted for large snowfalls totaling around four meters in the area. [CLS] [SEP] Freeze-thaw conditions created a weak layer on top of an existing snow pack; further snow was then deposited on top. [CLS] [SEP] This, coupled with high wind speeds, created large snow drifts and caused roughly 170,000 tons of snow to be deposited. [CLS] [SEP]
