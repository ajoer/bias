[CLS] Publius Cornelius Scipio Africanus (; 236/235 – 183 BC) was a Roman general and later consul who is often regarded as one of the greatest military commanders and strategists of all time. [SEP] [CLS] His main achievements were during the Second Punic War. [SEP] [CLS] He is best known for defeating Hannibal at the final Battle of Zama (near modern Zama, Tunisia) in 202 BC. [SEP] [CLS] The victory was one of the feats that earned him the agnomen Africanus. [SEP] [CLS] Scipio's conquest of Carthaginian Iberia culminated in the Battle of Ilipa (near Alcalá del Río, Spain) in 206 BC against Hannibal's brother Mago Barca. [SEP] [CLS] Although considered a hero by the Roman people, primarily for his victories against Carthage, Africanus had many opponents, especially Cato the Elder, who hated him deeply. [SEP] [CLS] In 187 BC, he was even tried alongside his brother for bribes they supposedly received from King Antiochos III during the Roman–Seleucid War. [SEP] [CLS] Disillusioned by the ingratitude of his peers, Scipio left Rome and retired from public life at his villa in Liternum. [SEP] [CLS]
