James Buchanan Jr. [CLS] [SEP] (; April 23, 1791 – June 1, 1868) was an American lawyer and politician who served as the 15th president of the United States (1857–1861). [CLS] [SEP] He previously served as Secretary of State (1845–1849) and represented Pennsylvania in both houses of the U.S. [CLS] [SEP] Congress. [CLS] [SEP] He was a states' rights advocate, and minimized the role of the federal government in the nation's closing era of slavery. [CLS] [SEP] He is therefore consistently ranked by historians as one of the least effective presidents in history, for his failure to mitigate the national disunity that led to the American Civil War. [CLS] [SEP] Buchanan was a prominent lawyer in Pennsylvania and won his first election to the state’s House of Representatives as a Federalist. [CLS] [SEP] In 1820, he was elected to the U.S. [CLS] [SEP] House of Representatives and retained that post for 11 years, aligning with Andrew Jackson's Democratic Party. [CLS] [SEP] He served as Jackson's Minister to Russia (1832). [CLS] [SEP] He won election in 1834 as a U.S. [CLS] [SEP] senator from Pennsylvania and also held that position for 11 years. [CLS] [SEP] In 1845 he was appointed to serve as President James K. [CLS] [SEP] Polk's Secretary of State, and in 1853 he was named as President Franklin Pierce's Minister to the United Kingdom. [CLS] [SEP] Beginning in 1844 Buchanan became a regular contender for the Democratic party's presidential nomination. [CLS] [SEP] He was finally nominated in 1856, defeating incumbent Franklin Pierce and Senator Stephen A. [CLS] [SEP] Douglas at the Democratic National Convention. [CLS] [SEP] Buchanan and running mate John C. [CLS] [SEP] Breckinridge of Kentucky defeated Republican John C. [CLS] [SEP] Frémont and Know-Nothing former president Millard Fillmore to win the 1856 presidential election. [CLS] [SEP] Buchanan supported the decision of the Supreme Court in the Dred Scott case, which denied a slave's petition for freedom. [CLS] [SEP] He also joined with Southern leaders in attempting to admit Kansas to the Union as a slave state. [CLS] [SEP] He thereby angered not only the Republicans but also many Northern Democrats. [CLS] [SEP] Buchanan honored his pledge to serve only one term, and supported Breckinridge's unsuccessful candidacy in the 1860 presidential election, which was won by Republican Abraham Lincoln. [CLS] [SEP] Just weeks after Lincoln was elected as Buchanan's successor, Southern states began seceding from the U.S., and the American Civil War started. [CLS] [SEP] Historians fault Buchanan for not addressing the issue of slavery, and for not forestalling the secession. [CLS] [SEP]
