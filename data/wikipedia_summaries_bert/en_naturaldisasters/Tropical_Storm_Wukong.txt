[CLS] The 2012 Pacific typhoon season was a fairly average but destructive season, though rather active since 2004. [SEP] [CLS] It produced 25 named storms, fourteen typhoons, and four intense typhoons. [SEP] [CLS] It was an event in the annual cycle of tropical cyclone formation, in which tropical cyclones form in the western Pacific Ocean. [SEP] [CLS] The season ran throughout 2012, though most tropical cyclones typically develop between May and October. [SEP] [CLS] The season's first named storm, Pakhar, developed on March 28, while the season's last named storm, Wukong, dissipated on December 29. [SEP] [CLS] The season's first typhoon, Guchol, reached typhoon status on June 15, and became the first super typhoon of the year on June 17. [SEP] [CLS] The scope of this article is limited to the Pacific Ocean, to the north of the equator between 100°E and the 180th meridian. [SEP] [CLS] Within the northwestern Pacific Ocean, there are two separate agencies that assign names to tropical cyclones, which can often result in a cyclone having two names. [SEP] [CLS] The Japan Meteorological Agency (JMA) will name a tropical cyclone should it be judged to have 10-minute sustained wind speeds of at least 65 km/h (40 mph) anywhere in the basin. [SEP] [CLS] PAGASA assigns unofficial names to tropical cyclones which move into or form as a tropical depression in their area of responsibility, located between 115°E–135°E and between 5°N–25°N, regardless of whether or not a tropical cyclone has already been given a name by the JMA. [SEP] [CLS] Tropical depressions that are monitored by the United States' Joint Typhoon Warning Center (JTWC) are given a numerical designation with a "W" suffix. [SEP] [CLS]
