[CLS] The 2014 Assiniboine River flood was caused by above average precipitation in western Manitoba and Saskatchewan. [SEP] [CLS] Unlike most prior floods, this flood was not due to spring runoff, but rather significant rainfall. [SEP] [CLS] Flooding and high water involved both the main stem of the Assiniboine River and many of its tributaries including the Qu'Appelle River and the Souris River. [SEP] [CLS] The flood came just 3 years after the 2011 Assiniboine River Flood which was considered a 1 in 300 year event. [SEP] [CLS] Peak flows along the river for the first crest were generally slightly less than in 2011. [SEP] [CLS] However, the second peak on the river has exceeded 2011 levels starting near St. [SEP] [CLS] Lazare, Manitoba up to Brandon, Manitoba so far. [SEP] [CLS]
