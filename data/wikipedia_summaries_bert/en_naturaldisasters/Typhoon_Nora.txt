Typhoon Nora, known in the Philippines as Typhoon Luming, was the fourth-most intense tropical cyclone on record. [CLS] [SEP] Originating from an area of low pressure over the western Pacific, Nora was first identified as a tropical depression on October 2, 1973. [CLS] [SEP] Tracking generally westward, the system gradually intensified, attaining typhoon status the following evening. [CLS] [SEP] After turning northwestward, the typhoon underwent a period of rapid intensification, during which its central pressure decreased by 77 mb (hPa; 2.27 inHg) in 24 hours. [CLS] [SEP] At the end of this phase, Nora peaked with winds of 295 km/h (185 mph) and a pressure of 877 mb (hPa; 25.91 inHg), making it the most-intense tropical cyclone on record (alongside Typhoon Ida in 1958) at the time; however, this pressure has since been surpassed by three other typhoons and one hurricane. [CLS] [SEP] The typhoon subsequently weakened and turned northwestward as it approached the Philippines. [CLS] [SEP] After brushing Luzon on October 7, the system passed south of Taiwan and ultimately made landfall in China on October 10. [CLS] [SEP] Once onshore, Nora quickly weakened and dissipated the following day. [CLS] [SEP] The Philippines and Taiwan sustained the most extensive losses from Typhoon Nora, with 36 people losing their lives collectively. [CLS] [SEP] In the former, more than 1 million residents were left homeless as high winds and flooding wrecked homes. [CLS] [SEP] Damage in the country reached $2 million (1973 USD). [CLS] [SEP] In Taiwan, more than 1,000 homes were destroyed and 8,000 people were left homeless. [CLS] [SEP] The typhoon was also responsible for several maritime incidents that killed at least four people. [CLS] [SEP]
