[CLS] Pan Am Flight 7 was a westbound around-the-world flight originating in San Francisco that crashed in the Pacific Ocean on November 8, 1957, while flying to Honolulu, Hawaii. [SEP] [CLS] The aircraft assigned to the flight was a Boeing 377 Stratocruiser named Clipper Romance Of The Skies, and the crash killed all 36 passengers and 8 crew members. [SEP] [CLS] No radio reports of any emergencies were ever received from the crew of the flight, and the fate of the flight was not known until about nine hours after its last known radio transmission, when the plane, if it had still been flying, would have exhausted its fuel. [SEP] [CLS] Under the assumption that the plane could have survived a controlled landing on the ocean surface, the United States Coast Guard launched a massive search for the plane and any potential survivors. [SEP] [CLS] The week-long hunt became the largest search and rescue operation in the Pacific Ocean at the time. [SEP] [CLS] The bodies of 19 of the victims and pieces of the plane were eventually recovered from the ocean about 900 miles (1,400 km) northeast of Honolulu. [SEP] [CLS] Multiple investigations into the cause of the crash were inconclusive. [SEP] [CLS] Despite some theories that the plane may have been the victim of sabotage, poor maintenance, or in-flight fire, investigators could not find enough evidence to support any definite conclusion. [SEP] [CLS] The final report from the Civil Aeronautics Board (CAB), who conducted the investigation, stated, "The Board has insufficient tangible evidence at this time to determine the cause of the accident."
