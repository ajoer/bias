The 1889 Kumamoto earthquake occurred at 11.40 p.m local time on July 28 in the western part of Kumamoto. [CLS] [SEP] It was also called the Kinpozan earthquake (or Kinbozan earthquake, since its epicenter was the southern-eastern foot of Mount Kinpu) and its magnitude was 6.3. [CLS] [SEP] Twenty people died (5 in Kumamoto City and 15 in Akita Gun, Kumamoto Prefecture) and hundreds of houses and parts of Kumamoto Castle were destroyed. [CLS] [SEP] The earthquake was the first major one after the establishment of the Seismological Society of Japan (in 1880), and its waves were recorded as far as Potsdam, Germany. [CLS] [SEP] Few houses were affected by fire since the quake occurred at midnight. [CLS] [SEP] Aftershocks occurred for five months, and some people had to sleep outdoors. [CLS] [SEP] Tadao Shimoma thought that the earthquake was a combination of the Tatsuda fault and unsuccessful volcanic activities, since there were injections of aerosol into the air at many places around Mt. [CLS] [SEP] Kinpo, Ninotake and Sannotake. [CLS] [SEP] He claimed the Kinpo mountains (now showing no volcanic activities) are similar to Mt. [CLS] [SEP] Unzen in petrology. [CLS] [SEP] The photographs were considered the earliest earthquake damage photos in Japan. [CLS] [SEP]
