[CLS] The following is an extensive list of earthquakes that have been detected in Britain & Ireland. [SEP] [CLS] On average, several hundred earthquakes are detected by the British Geological Survey each year, but almost all are far too faint to be felt by humans. [SEP] [CLS] Those that are felt generally cause very little damage. [SEP] [CLS] Nonetheless, earthquakes have on occasion resulted in considerable damage, most notably in 1580 and 1884; Musson (2003) reports that there have been ten documented fatalities – six caused by falling masonry and four by building collapse. [SEP] [CLS] The causes of earthquakes in the UK are unclear, but may include "regional compression caused by motion of the Earth’s tectonic plates, and uplift resulting from the melting of the ice sheets that covered many parts of Britain thousands of years ago." Medieval reports of "earthquakes" that damaged or destroyed newly built cathedrals may have been caused by catastrophic failure of overloaded masonry, particularly towers, rather than actual earthquakes.
