Severe Tropical Cyclone Nina was a significant tropical cyclone, which impacted six island nations and caused several deaths. [CLS] [SEP] The system was first noted as a tropical low over the Cape York Peninsula on December 21. [CLS] [SEP] Over the next few days the system moved south-westwards and moved into the Gulf of Carpentaria where it was named Nina, after it had developed into a tropical cyclone during December 23. [CLS] [SEP] The system was subsequently steered south-eastwards by an upper level trough of low pressure, before it made landfall as a Category 2 tropical cyclone on the Cape York Peninsula near Cape Keerweer during December 25. [CLS] [SEP] Over land the system weakened into a tropical low before it regenerated into a tropical cyclone over the Coral Sea during December 28. [CLS] [SEP] The system subsequently moved north-eastwards, under the influence of Severe Tropical Cyclone Kina and an upper level ridge of high pressure. [CLS] [SEP] During January 1, 1993, Nina peaked with sustained wind speeds of 140 km/h (85 mph), as it affected Rennell, Bellona and Temotu provinces in the Solomon Islands. [CLS] [SEP] The system subsequently gradually weakened as it accelerated eastwards and affected Rotuma, Wallis and Futuna, Tonga and Niue. [CLS] [SEP] Nina was subsequently absorbed by Kina, while both systems were located near the Southern Cook Islands during January 5. [CLS] [SEP]
