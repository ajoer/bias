The 1960 Atlantic hurricane season was the least active season since 1952. [CLS] [SEP] The season officially began on June 15, and lasted until November 15. [CLS] [SEP] These dates conventionally delimit the period of each year when most tropical cyclones form in the Atlantic basin. [CLS] [SEP] The first system, an unnamed storm, developed in the Bay of Campeche on June 22. [CLS] [SEP] It brought severe local flooding to southeastern Texas and was considered the worst disaster in some towns since a Hurricane in 1945. [CLS] [SEP] The unnamed storm moved across the United States for almost a week before dissipating on June 29. [CLS] [SEP] In July, Hurricane Abby resulted in minor damage in the Leeward Islands, before impacting a few Central American counties â€” the remnants of the storm would go on to form Hurricane Celeste in the East Pacific. [CLS] [SEP] Later that month, Tropical Storm Brenda caused flooding across much of the East Coast of the United States. [CLS] [SEP] The next storm, Hurricane Cleo, caused no known impact, despite its close proximity to land. [CLS] [SEP] The most significant storm of the season was Hurricane Donna, which at the time was among the ten costliest United States hurricanes. [CLS] [SEP] After the precursor caused a deadly plane crash in Senegal, the storm itself brought severe flooding and wind impacts to the Lesser Antilles and Florida, where Donna made landfall as a Category 4 hurricane. [CLS] [SEP] It moved northeast and struck North Carolina and Long Island, New York, while still at hurricane intensity. [CLS] [SEP] Donna caused at least 227 fatalities and $900 million (1960 USD) in damage. [CLS] [SEP] Hurricane Ethel reached Category 3 intensity, but rapidly weakened before making landfall in Mississippi, resulting in only 1 fatality and $1.5 million in losses. [CLS] [SEP] The final storm, Florence, developed on September 17. [CLS] [SEP] It remained weakened and moved erratically over Cuba and Florida. [CLS] [SEP] Only minor flooding was reported. [CLS] [SEP] Collectively, the tropical cyclones in 1960 caused at least 250 deaths and about $910.74 million in damage. [CLS] [SEP]
