Carl Linnaeus (; 23 May 1707 – 10 January 1778), also known after his ennoblement as Carl von Linné (Swedish pronunciation: [ˈkɑːɭ fɔn lɪˈneː] (listen)), was a Swedish botanist, zoologist, and physician who formalised binomial nomenclature, the modern system of naming organisms. [CLS] [SEP] He is known as the "father of modern taxonomy". [CLS] [SEP] Many of his writings were in Latin, and his name is rendered in Latin as Carolus Linnæus (after 1761 Carolus a Linné). [CLS] [SEP] Linnaeus was born in the countryside of Småland in southern Sweden. [CLS] [SEP] He received most of his higher education at Uppsala University and began giving lectures in botany there in 1730. [CLS] [SEP] He lived abroad between 1735 and 1738, where he studied and also published the first edition of his Systema Naturae in the Netherlands. [CLS] [SEP] He then returned to Sweden where he became professor of medicine and botany at Uppsala. [CLS] [SEP] In the 1740s, he was sent on several journeys through Sweden to find and classify plants and animals. [CLS] [SEP] In the 1750s and 1760s, he continued to collect and classify animals, plants, and minerals, while publishing several volumes. [CLS] [SEP] He was one of the most acclaimed scientists in Europe at the time of his death. [CLS] [SEP] Philosopher Jean-Jacques Rousseau sent him the message: "Tell him I know no greater man on earth." Johann Wolfgang von Goethe wrote: "With the exception of Shakespeare and Spinoza, I know no one among the no longer living who has influenced me more strongly." Swedish author August Strindberg wrote: "Linnaeus was in reality a poet who happened to become a naturalist." Linnaeus has been called Princeps botanicorum (Prince of Botanists) and "The Pliny of the North". [CLS] [SEP] He is also considered as one of the founders of modern ecology.In botany and zoology, the abbreviation L. [CLS] [SEP] is used to indicate Linnaeus as the authority for a species' name. [CLS] [SEP] In older publications, the abbreviation "Linn." is found. [CLS] [SEP] Linnaeus's remains comprise the type specimen for the species Homo sapiens following the International Code of Zoological Nomenclature, since the sole specimen that he is known to have examined was himself.
