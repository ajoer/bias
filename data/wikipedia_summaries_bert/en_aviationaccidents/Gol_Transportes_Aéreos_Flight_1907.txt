Gol Transportes Aéreos Flight 1907 was a Boeing 737-8EH on a scheduled domestic passenger flight from Manaus, Brazil, to Rio de Janeiro. [CLS] [SEP] On the afternoon of 29 September 2006, it collided in mid-air with an Embraer Legacy 600 business jet over the Brazilian state of Mato Grosso. [CLS] [SEP] The Boeing 737 broke up in mid-air and crashed into an area of dense jungle, killing all 154 passengers and crew on board. [CLS] [SEP] Despite sustaining serious damage to its left wing and tail, the Embraer Legacy jet landed safely with its seven occupants uninjured.The accident was investigated by the Brazilian Aeronautical Accidents Investigation and Prevention Center (Portuguese: Centro de Investigação e Prevenção de Acidentes Aeronáuticos (CENIPA)) and the U.S. [CLS] [SEP] National Transportation Safety Board (NTSB), and a final report was issued in 2008. [CLS] [SEP] CENIPA concluded that the accident was caused by air traffic control (ATC) errors combined with mistakes – including a failure to recognize that their traffic collision avoidance system (TCAS) was not activated – made by the American pilots on the Legacy, while the NTSB determined that both flight crews acted properly and were placed on a collision course by ATC, deeming the Legacy pilots' disabling of their TCAS system to be only a contributing factor rather than a direct cause.The accident, which triggered a crisis in Brazilian civil aviation, was the deadliest in Brazil's aviation history at the time. [CLS] [SEP] It remains the second worst plane crash in Brazil, after TAM Airlines Flight 3054 in 2007. [CLS] [SEP] This accident was also the first hull-loss and the first fatal accident of a Boeing 737-800. [CLS] [SEP]
