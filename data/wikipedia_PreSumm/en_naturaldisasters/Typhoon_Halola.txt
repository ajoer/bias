[CLS] Typhoon Halola, known in the Philippines as Typhoon Goring, was a small but long-lived tropical cyclone in July 2015 that traveled 7,640 km (4,750 mi) across the Pacific Ocean. [SEP] [CLS] The fifth named storm of the 2015 Pacific hurricane season, Halola originated from a Western Pacific monsoon trough that had expanded into the Central Pacific by July 5. [SEP] [CLS] Over the next several days, the system waxed and waned due to changes in wind shear before organizing into a tropical depression on July 10 while well southwest of Hawaii. [SEP] [CLS] The depression strengthened into Tropical Storm Halola on the next day as it traveled westward. [SEP] [CLS] Halola crossed the International Date Line on July 13 and entered the Western Pacific, where it was immediately recognized as a severe tropical storm. [SEP] [CLS] The storm further strengthened into a typhoon over the next day before encountering strong wind shear on July 16, upon which it quickly weakened into a tropical depression as it passed south of Wake Island. [SEP] [CLS] However, the shear relaxed on July 19, allowing Halola to reintensify. [SEP] [CLS] On July 21, Halola regained typhoon status and later peaked with 10-minute sustained winds of 150 km/h (90 mph) and a minimum pressure of 955 hPa (mbar; 28.20 inHg). [SEP] [CLS] From July 23 onward, increasing wind shear and dry air caused Halola to weaken slowly. [SEP] [CLS] The system fell below typhoon intensity on July 25 as it began to recurve northwards. [SEP] [CLS] Halola made landfall over Kyushu on July 26 as a tropical storm and dissipated in the Tsushima Strait shortly after. [SEP] [CLS] The typhoon initially posed a significant threat to Wake Island, prompting the evacuation of all personnel from the military base spanning the atoll; however, no damage resulted from its passage. [SEP] [CLS] Heavy rains and strong winds buffeted the Ryukyu Islands, with record rainfall observed in Tokunoshima. [SEP] [CLS] Flooding and landslides forced the evacuation of several thousand people. [SEP] [CLS] Damage was relatively limited, though the sugarcane crop sustained Â¥154 million (US$1.24 million) in damage. [SEP] [CLS] Two people were injured in Kyushu. [SEP] [CLS]
