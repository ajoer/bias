The 2011-2017 California drought was a persistent drought from the period of December 2011 to March 2017, and is one of the most intense droughts in California history, with the period of late 2011 through 2014 being the driest in California history. [CLS] [SEP] The drought killed 102 million trees from 2011 to 2016, with 62 million killed in 2016 alone. [CLS] [SEP] The cause of the drought is attributed to a ridge of high pressure in the Pacific Sea — the "Ridiculously Resilient Ridge" — which often barred powerful winter storms from reaching the state.By February 2017, the state drought percentage returned to levels below that of late 2011, mainly due to a very wet pattern caused by atmospheric river-enhanced Pacific storms. [CLS] [SEP] The wet pattern caused severe flooding. [CLS] [SEP] In mid-March 2019, California was declared totally drought-free, with the exception of a small pocket of "abnormally dry" conditions in Southern California, following a series of powerful Pacific storms during the first few months of the year. [CLS] [SEP] This coincided with the U.S. [CLS] [SEP] experiencing drought conditions in the fewest parts of the country since 2000. [CLS] [SEP]
