Pan Am Flight 845/26 was a four-engined Boeing 377 Stratocruiser named Clipper United States and registered as N1032V. [CLS] [SEP] It departed Portland International Airport in Oregon on a flight to Honolulu International Airport in Hawaii on March 26, 1955. [CLS] [SEP] The aircraft was en route and about 35 miles (56 km) off the Oregon coast when at 11:12 Pacific Standard Time the No. [CLS] [SEP] 3 engine and propeller tore loose from the wing causing a loss of control. [CLS] [SEP] The aircraft was ditched. [CLS] [SEP] The aircraft floated for twenty minutes before sinking in 1,600 metres (5,200 ft) of water. [CLS] [SEP] Approximately two hours after the aircraft ditched, the United States Navy attack transport USS Bayfield (APA-33) arrived on the scene and rescued the 19 survivors. [CLS] [SEP] Four people died.The probable cause was failure of No. [CLS] [SEP] 3 propeller which caused the engine to detach and the aircraft to become uncontrollable. [CLS] [SEP] The experience provided lessons that helped prevent any casualties in another ditching the following year, when Pan Am Flight 6 sank between Honolulu and San Francisco. [CLS] [SEP]
