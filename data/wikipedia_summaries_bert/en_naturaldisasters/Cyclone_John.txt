Severe Tropical Cyclone John was an intense tropical cyclone that rapidly deepened offshore before devastating areas of Western Australia. [CLS] [SEP] The system was the second cyclone and first severe tropical cyclone of the active 1999–00 Australian region cyclone season. [CLS] [SEP] Cyclone John developed from a monsoon trough positioned northwest of Australia on 9 December 1999. [CLS] [SEP] As it moved to the west and later south as the result of a subtropical ridge under favourable conditions, the cyclone was able to rapidly intensify. [CLS] [SEP] John reached peak intensity on 14 December as a Category 5 cyclone on the Australian cyclone scale, the highest rating possible. [CLS] [SEP] Cyclone John later began interacting with a mid–latitude trough, which slightly weakened the cyclone prior to making landfall near Whim Creek early on 15 December. [CLS] [SEP] Increasingly unfavourable conditions further inland resulted in the cyclone's rapid weakening, before it dissipated during the next day. [CLS] [SEP] Cyclone John extensively affected areas of Western Australia, but damage was not as bad as expected. [CLS] [SEP] Widespread power outages across the Pilbara region were caused by John. [CLS] [SEP] Strong winds caused minor damage to infrastructure across the coast, as well as tree damage. [CLS] [SEP] 140 windmills were destroyed by the cyclone on the coast. [CLS] [SEP] Further inland, rainfall associated with the cyclone and its remnants brought flooding, which flooded 25 houses and caused rivers to overflow. [CLS] [SEP] The system was responsible for no deaths and a limited amount of damage. [CLS] [SEP] After the season, the name John was retired from the Australian tropical cyclone naming list.
