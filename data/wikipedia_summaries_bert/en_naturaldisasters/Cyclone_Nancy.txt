[CLS] Cyclone Nancy (RSMC Nadi designation: 09F, JTWC designation: 18P) was the second in a series of four severe tropical cyclones to impact the Cook Islands during February 2005. [SEP] [CLS] Forming out of an area of low pressure on February 10, Nancy quickly organized into a small, but intense, cyclone. [SEP] [CLS] By February 14, the storm explosively intensified into a Category 4 severe tropical cyclone with winds peaking at 175 km/h (110 mph 10-minute winds) and a minimum barometric pressure of 935 hPa (mbar). [SEP] [CLS] Over the following day, increasing wind shear rapidly weakened the cyclone and by February 17, it transitioned into an extratropical cyclone shortly before being absorbed by Cyclone Olaf. [SEP] [CLS] Already impacted by Cyclone Meena in early February, the Cook Islands sustained significant damage from Cyclone Nancy. [SEP] [CLS] Several homes were damaged and destroyed throughout the islands. [SEP] [CLS] Downed trees and power lines blocked roads and cut power and minor flooding was reported along coastal areas. [SEP] [CLS] Following the impact of the storm, the World Meteorological Organization retired the name Nancy in May 2006 and replaced it with the name Nat. [SEP] [CLS]
