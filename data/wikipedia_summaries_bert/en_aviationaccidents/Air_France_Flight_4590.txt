Air France Flight 4590 was an international charter flight, from Charles de Gaulle Airport, Paris to John F. [CLS] [SEP] Kennedy International Airport, New York, flown by an AÃ©rospatiale-BAC Concorde. [CLS] [SEP] On the afternoon of Tuesday, 25 July 2000 at 14:44:31 (UTC, 16:44:31 time local in France), the aircraft serving the flight (registration F-BTSC) ran over debris on the runway during takeoff, blowing a tyre, and sending debris flying into the underside of the left wing, and into the landing gear bay. [CLS] [SEP] The fuel tank that was inside the left wing was unusually full, and the resulting lack of air space in the tank caused it to rupture and send fuel pouring outward with great force when debris from the tire struck the wing thus creating a shock wave that weakened the tank. [CLS] [SEP] Debris, which flew into the landing gear bay, severed power wiring for the landing gear, making it impossible to retract the gear as the aircraft climbed. [CLS] [SEP] Sparks produced by the broken wiring ignited fuel from the ruptured fuel tank and along with the fire came a reduction of thrust from Engine 1 and 2. [CLS] [SEP] Lack of thrust, the high drag caused by the inability to retract the gear, along with fire damage to the flight controls, made it impossible to control the aircraft with the result that it crashed into a hotel in nearby Gonesse two minutes after takeoff, killing all 109 people on board and four more people in the hotel, with another person in the hotel critically injured.The flight was chartered by German company Peter Deilmann Cruises, and the passengers were on their way to board the cruise ship MS Deutschland in New York City for a 16-day cruise to Manta, Ecuador. [CLS] [SEP] It was the only fatal Concorde accident during its 27-year operational history. [CLS] [SEP]
