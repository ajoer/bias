[CLS] The 1975 Pacific typhoon season was one of the deadliest tropical cyclone seasons on record, with nearly 230,000 fatalities occurring during the season. [SEP] [CLS] It had no official bounds; it ran year-round in 1975, but most tropical cyclones tend to form in the northwestern Pacific Ocean between June and December. [SEP] [CLS] These dates conventionally delimit the period of each year when most tropical cyclones form in the northwestern Pacific Ocean. [SEP] [CLS] Tropical Storms formed in the entire west pacific basin were assigned a name by the Joint Typhoon Warning Center. [SEP] [CLS] Tropical depressions in this basin have the "W" suffix added to their number. [SEP] [CLS] Tropical depressions that enter or form in the Philippine area of responsibility are assigned a name by the Philippine Atmospheric, Geophysical and Astronomical Services Administration or PAGASA. [SEP] [CLS] This can often result in the same storm having two names. [SEP] [CLS] Some of the notable storms here are Typhoon Nina, which caused the Banqiao Dam flood, which resulted in approximately 229,000 people dead, and Super Typhoon June, which was the strongest storm on record with a pressure of 875 mbar, until beaten by Typhoon Tip in 1979 with 870 mbar.
