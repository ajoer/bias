Hurricane Claudette was the third tropical storm and first hurricane of the 2003 Atlantic hurricane season. [CLS] [SEP] A fairly long-lived July Atlantic hurricane, Claudette began as a tropical wave in the eastern Caribbean. [CLS] [SEP] It moved quickly westward, brushing past the Yucat√°n Peninsula before moving northwestward through the Gulf of Mexico. [CLS] [SEP] Claudette remained a tropical storm until just before making landfall in Port O'Connor, Texas, when it quickly strengthened to a strong Category 1 hurricane on the Saffir-Simpson Hurricane Scale. [CLS] [SEP] Forecasting of its path and intensity was uncertain throughout its lifetime, resulting in widespread and often unnecessary preparations along its path. [CLS] [SEP] Claudette was the first hurricane to make landfall in July in the United States since Hurricane Danny in the 1997 season. [CLS] [SEP] The hurricane caused two deaths and moderate damage in Texas, mostly from strong winds, as well as extensive beach erosion. [CLS] [SEP] Because of the damage, President George W. [CLS] [SEP] Bush declared portions of South Texas a Federal Disaster Area, allowing the affected citizens to apply for aid. [CLS] [SEP] Claudette also caused significant rainfall and minor damage in the Mexican state of Quintana Roo as a tropical storm, as well as minor damage on Saint Lucia before developing into a tropical cyclone.
