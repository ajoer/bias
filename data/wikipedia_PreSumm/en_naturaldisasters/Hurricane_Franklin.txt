[CLS] Hurricane Franklin was the first hurricane to make landfall in the Mexican state of Veracruz since Hurricane Karl in 2010. [SEP] [CLS] The sixth named storm, first hurricane and the first of ten consecutive hurricanes of the 2017 Atlantic hurricane season, Franklin formed on August 7 out of a tropical wave that was first tracked in the southeastern Caribbean Sea on August 3. [SEP] [CLS] The storm strengthened within a favorable environment and made landfall on the Yucatán Peninsula as a moderate tropical storm early on August 8 north of Belize. [SEP] [CLS] Weakening occurred as it crossed the peninsula, but Franklin re-emerged into the Bay of Campeche later that day, restrengthening quickly to become the season's first hurricane. [SEP] [CLS] It made landfall near Lechuguillas, Veracruz, on August 10 as a Category 1 hurricane, before rapidly weakening over the mountainous terrain of Mexico and dissipating shortly afterwards. [SEP] [CLS] On August 12, the storm's remnant mid-level circulation combined with a developing low in the Eastern Pacific to form Tropical Storm Jova. [SEP] [CLS] Franklin's main impacts were located in Eastern Mexico, specifically in the state of Veracruz where Franklin made landfall as a hurricane. [SEP] [CLS] Strong winds downed trees and power lines, in addition to damaging homes and crops. [SEP] [CLS] Heavy rains flooded some rivers and caused a few landslides. [SEP] [CLS] Damages in that area totaled US$15 million. [SEP] [CLS] Other areas that Franklin affected, primarily by bringing heavy rain, included the Yucatán Peninsula and Belize. [SEP] [CLS] No deaths were reported to have occurred due to Franklin. [SEP] [CLS]
