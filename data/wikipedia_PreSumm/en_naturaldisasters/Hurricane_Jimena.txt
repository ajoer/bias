[CLS] Hurricane Jimena was the tenth named storm and second hurricane of the 2003 Pacific hurricane season. [SEP] [CLS] Jimena formed on August 28 in the far Eastern Pacific Ocean as a tropical depression and moved westward where it rapidly became a hurricane the following day. [SEP] [CLS] The storm moved westward into the Central Pacific Ocean where it became a Category 2 hurricane on the Saffir–Simpson Hurricane Scale. [SEP] [CLS] After reaching its peak strength as a Category 2 hurricane, the storm began to weaken due to increasing wind shear. [SEP] [CLS] Jimena brushed past the Hawaiian Islands before becoming a tropical depression on September 3. [SEP] [CLS] The weakening storm then crossed the international dateline before dissipating on September 5, becoming one of the few storms to cross both 140ºW and International Date Line. [SEP] [CLS] Jimena was the first Pacific hurricane to threaten Hawaii since Hurricane Daniel of the 2000 Pacific hurricane season. [SEP] [CLS] However, the storm weakened as it passed south of the islands and the effects from Jimena were minimal; there were no reported fatalities or injuries from the storm. [SEP] [CLS]
