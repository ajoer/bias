[CLS] Tropical Storm Bonnie was a tropical storm that made landfall on Florida in August 2004. [SEP] [CLS] The second storm of the 2004 Atlantic hurricane season, Bonnie developed from a tropical wave on August 3 to the east of the Lesser Antilles. [SEP] [CLS] After moving through the islands, its fast forward motion caused it to dissipate. [SEP] [CLS] However, it later regenerated into a tropical storm near Yucat√°n Peninsula. [SEP] [CLS] Bonnie attained peak winds of 65 miles per hour (105 km/h) over the Gulf of Mexico, turned to the northeast, and hit Florida as a 45 miles per hour (72 km/h) tropical storm. [SEP] [CLS] The storm accelerated to the northeast and became an extratropical cyclone to the east of New Jersey. [SEP] [CLS] Bonnie was the first of five tropical systems to make landfall on Florida in the 2004 Atlantic hurricane season, and the second of a record eight disturbances to reach tropical storm strength during the month of August. [SEP] [CLS] Bonnie's impact was minimal. [SEP] [CLS] Throughout the Caribbean Sea, the storm's effects consisted primarily of light rainfall, and in Florida, the precipitation caused flooding and minor damage. [SEP] [CLS] The tropical storm caused a tornado outbreak across the Southeastern United States which killed three people and inflicted over $1 million (2004 USD) in damage. [SEP] [CLS] Bonnie made landfall in Florida the day before Hurricane Charley struck. [SEP] [CLS]
