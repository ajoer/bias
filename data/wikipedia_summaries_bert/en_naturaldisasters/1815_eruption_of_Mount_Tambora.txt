The 1815 eruption of Mount Tambora was the most powerful Volcanic eruption in human history, with a Volcanic Explosivity Index (VEI) of 7. [CLS] [SEP] It is the most recently known VEI-7 event and the only unambiguously confirmed VEI-7 eruption since the Lake Taupo eruption in about 180 AD.Mount Tambora is on the island of Sumbawa in present-day Indonesia, then part of the Dutch East Indies. [CLS] [SEP] Although its eruption reached a violent climax on 10 April 1815, increased steaming and small phreatic eruptions occurred during the next six months to three years. [CLS] [SEP] The ash from the eruption column dispersed around the world and lowered global temperatures in an event sometimes known as the Year Without a Summer in 1816. [CLS] [SEP] This brief period of significant climate change triggered extreme weather and harvest failures in many areas around the world. [CLS] [SEP] Several climate forcings coincided and interacted in a systematic manner that has not been observed after any other large volcanic eruption since the early Stone Age. [CLS] [SEP]
