[CLS] A deadly tornado outbreak occurred in Central Texas during the afternoon hours of May 27, 1997 in conjunction with a southwestward moving storm complex. [SEP] [CLS] The complex produced 20 total tornadoes, mainly along the Interstate 35 corridor from northeast of Waco to north of San Antonio. [SEP] [CLS] The outbreak was particularly noteworthy for spawning the Jarrell tornado, one of the fiercest and most destructive F5 tornadoes ever recorded. [SEP] [CLS] At its peak, the Jarrell tornado was three quarters of a mile (1.2 km) wide and tracked across the ground for 5.1 miles (8.2 km), inflicting catastrophic damage in northwestern parts of Jarrell while killing 27 people. [SEP] [CLS] All 27 deaths caused by the tornado occurred within one subdivision of Jarrell – a neighborhood of 38 well-built houses called Double Creek Estates. [SEP] [CLS] Each residence was completely dismantled, swept away, and reduced to a concrete slab, while trees in the area were completely shredded and debarked, and grassy fields were scoured to a depth of 18 inches (46 cm). [SEP] [CLS] Many tornado researchers, after reviewing aerial damage photographs of Double Creek Estates, considered the Jarrell storm to be the most violent tornado they had ever seen in terms of damage intensity.In addition to the Jarrell tornado, the outbreak produced an F4 tornado near Lake Travis and three F3 tornadoes – including one which moved through Cedar Park.
