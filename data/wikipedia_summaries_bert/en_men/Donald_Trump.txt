[SEP] [CLS] He entered the 2016 presidential race as a Republican and was elected in a surprise victory over Democratic nominee Hillary Clinton, although he lost the popular vote. [SEP] [CLS] He became the oldest first-term U.S. [SEP] [CLS] president, and the first without prior military or government service. [SEP] [CLS] His election and policies have sparked numerous protests. [SEP] [CLS] Trump has made many false or misleading statements during his campaign and presidency. [SEP] [CLS] The statements have been documented by fact-checkers, and the media have widely described the phenomenon as unprecedented in American politics. [SEP] [CLS] Many of his comments and actions have been characterized as racially charged or racist. [SEP] [CLS] During his presidency, Trump ordered a travel ban on citizens from several Muslim-majority countries, citing security concerns; after legal challenges, the Supreme Court upheld the policy's third revision.

[SEP] [CLS] Trump met thrice with North Korea's leader Kim Jong-un, but talks on denuclearization broke down in 2019. [SEP] [CLS] A special counsel investigation led by Robert Mueller found that Trump and his campaign welcomed and encouraged Russian interference in the 2016 presidential election under the belief that it would be politically advantageous, but did not find sufficient evidence to press charges of criminal conspiracy or coordination with Russia. [SEP] [CLS] Mueller also investigated Trump for obstruction of justice, and his report neither indicted nor exonerated Trump on that offense. [SEP] [CLS] After Trump solicited the investigation by Ukraine of a political rival (Joe Biden, who later became his presumptive Democratic opponent in the 2020 presidential election), the House of Representatives impeached him in December 2019 for abuse of power and obstruction of Congress. [SEP] [CLS] The Senate acquitted him of both charges in February 2020. [SEP] [CLS]
