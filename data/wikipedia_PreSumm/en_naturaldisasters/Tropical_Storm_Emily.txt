[CLS] Hurricane Emily was a powerful, early season, Cape Verde tropical cyclone that caused significant damage across the Caribbean Sea to Mexico. [SEP] [CLS] It was also the earliest forming Category 5 Atlantic hurricane on record in a season and the most intense to form before August. [SEP] [CLS] At the time, Emily was the earliest-forming fifth named storm in the Atlantic on record; this record has since been surpassed by 2020's Tropical Storm Edouard. [SEP] [CLS] After forming on July 10, 2005, the storm moved through the central Atlantic Ocean before passing through the Windward Islands on July 14. [SEP] [CLS] Tracking generally towards the west-northwest, the storm gradually intensified as it traversed the Caribbean, peaking as a Category 5 hurricane on July 16, marking the earliest date for a storm to do so during the course of a given year. [SEP] [CLS] The system subsequently made landfall in the Yucat√°n Peninsula as a Category 4. [SEP] [CLS] Quickly crossing the peninsula, Emily emerged into the Gulf of Mexico and reorganized. [SEP] [CLS] On July 20, the storm struck Tamaulipas as a major hurricane and rapidly dissipated within 24 hours. [SEP] [CLS] The storm caused significant damage along its path, with up to $1.01 billion (2005 USD) in damages recorded, as well as causing 17 fatalities. [SEP] [CLS] Emily is the most recent (and costliest) Category 5 storm to not have its name retired. [SEP] [CLS]
