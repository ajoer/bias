Hurricane Norman was the most recent tropical system to make landfall in California. [CLS] [SEP] The 14th named storm, 11th hurricane, and 6th major hurricane of the 1978 Pacific hurricane season, Norman evolved from a tropical disturbance noted 400 mi (640 km; 350 nmi) southeast of Acapulco on the afternoon of August 29, 1978. [CLS] [SEP] The system moved westward and developed into a tropical depression on August 30. [CLS] [SEP] Modest strengthening ensued, and the cyclone became a tropical storm that evening and a hurricane on the evening of August 31 as it turned to the west-northwest. [CLS] [SEP] Late on the night of September 1, Norman became a major hurricane with an eye 40 miles (64 km; 35 nmi) wide, and a nearby ship reported seas of 41 ft (12 m). [CLS] [SEP] The center grazed the northeast side of Socorro Island on the afternoon of September 2. [CLS] [SEP] Moving over cooler waters west of Baja California, the cyclone slowly weakened. [CLS] [SEP] By early on September 4, moisture from the hurricane spread north into California initiating rains in the Golden State. [CLS] [SEP] A developing trough to its west caused the initial influx of moisture and Norman's turn to the north as a weakening tropical storm. [CLS] [SEP] Eventually turning north-northeast towards southern California, the cyclone did eventually turn north-northeast towards southern California, and the cyclone weakened to a tropical depression as it passed the 30th parallel. [CLS] [SEP] Hurricane Norman made landfall in California on September 5, as a minimal tropical depression. [CLS] [SEP] The tropical cyclone became a remnant low shortly after California landfall, and the final advisory was issued at 00:00 GMT, on September 6. [CLS] [SEP] Over 7.01 in (178 mm) of rain occurred in the Sierra Nevada range. [CLS] [SEP] Rare late-summer snowfall was also reported in the higher mountains, killing several hikers. [CLS] [SEP]
