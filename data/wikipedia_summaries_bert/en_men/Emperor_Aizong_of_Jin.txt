[CLS] Emperor Aizong of Jin (25 September 1198 â€“ 9 February 1234), personal name Ningjiasu, sinicized names Wanyan Shouxu and Wanyan Shouli, was the ninth emperor of the Jurchen-led Jin dynasty, which ruled most of northern China between the 12th and 13th centuries. [SEP] [CLS] He was considered an able emperor who made several reforms beneficial to the Jin dynasty, such as the removal of corrupt officials and introduction of more lenient tax laws. [SEP] [CLS] He also ended the wars against the Southern Song dynasty, and canceled the Treaty of Shaoxing free of obligation, instead focusing the Jin dynasty's military resources on resisting the Mongol invasion. [SEP] [CLS] Despite his efforts, the Jin dynasty, already weakened by the flawed policies of his predecessors, eventually fell to the Mongol Empire. [SEP] [CLS] He escaped to Caizhou when the Mongols besieged Bianjing, the Jin capital (coincidentally the former Song capital), in 1232. [SEP] [CLS] When Caizhou also came under Mongol attack in 1234, he passed the throne to his army marshal Wanyan Chenglin and then died by suicide by hanging himself. [SEP] [CLS]
