Katharina von Bora (German: [kataˈʁiːna fɔn ˈbɔʁa]; 29 January 1499 – 20 December 1552), after her wedding Katharina Luther, also referred to as "die Lutherin" ("the Lutheress"), was the wife of Martin Luther, German reformer and a seminal figure of the Protestant Reformation. [CLS] [SEP] Beyond what is found in the writings of Luther and some of his contemporaries, little is known about her. [CLS] [SEP] Despite this, Katharina is often considered one of the most important participants in the Reformation because of her role in helping to define Protestant family life and setting the tone for clergy marriages.
