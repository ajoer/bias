[CLS] The great flood of '99 occurred when the Periyar River in Kerala state of India flooded in the month of July 1924. [SEP] [CLS] This is the year 1099 ME in the Malayalam Calendar (Kollam Era). [SEP] [CLS] As the Malayalam Calendar was popular in Kerala, the flood is generally referred to as 'തൊണ്ണൂറ്റി ഒമ്പതിലെ വെള്ളപ്പൊക്കം' (Thonnootti Onbathile Vellapokkam which translates to "flood of '99"). [SEP] [CLS] The rain continued for about three weeks. [SEP] [CLS] Many districts of present-day Kerala were deeply submerged by the flood - from Thrissur, to Ernakulam to Idukki, Kottayam even up to Alappuzha and Kuttanad. [SEP] [CLS] A huge mountain called Karinthiri Mala was washed away by this flood and the road to Munnar also went along with it. [SEP] [CLS] As the road to Munnar was lost by this flood, a new road from Ernakulam to Munnar became necessary - the present day road from Ernakulam to Munnar was constructed after this. [SEP] [CLS] Kundala Valley Railway which was the first monorail system in India was also completely destroyed. [SEP] [CLS] Various remnants of the old Railway systems still exist at Munnar.
