Hurricane Isabel was the strongest Atlantic hurricane since Mitch, and the deadliest, costliest, and most intense hurricane in the 2003 Atlantic hurricane season. [CLS] [SEP] The ninth named storm, fifth hurricane, and second major hurricane of the season, Isabel formed near the Cape Verde Islands from a tropical wave on September 6, in the tropical Atlantic Ocean. [CLS] [SEP] It moved northwestward, and within an environment of light wind shear and warm waters, it steadily strengthened to reach peak winds of 165 mph (270 km/h) on September 11. [CLS] [SEP] After fluctuating in intensity for four days, during which it displayed annular characteristics, Isabel gradually weakened and made landfall on the Outer Banks of North Carolina, with winds of 105 mph (165 km/h) on September 18. [CLS] [SEP] Isabel quickly weakened over land and became extratropical over western Pennsylvania on the next day. [CLS] [SEP] On September 20, the extratropical remnants of Isabel were absorbed into another system over Eastern Canada. [CLS] [SEP] In North Carolina, the storm surge from Isabel washed out a portion of Hatteras Island to form what was unofficially known as Isabel Inlet. [CLS] [SEP] Damage was greatest along the Outer Banks, where thousands of homes were damaged or even destroyed. [CLS] [SEP] The worst of the effects of Isabel occurred in Virginia, especially in the Hampton Roads area and along the shores of rivers as far west and north as Richmond and Baltimore. [CLS] [SEP] Virginia reported the most deaths and damage from the hurricane. [CLS] [SEP] About 64% of the damage and 69% of the deaths occurred in North Carolina and Virginia. [CLS] [SEP] Electric service was disrupted in areas of Virginia for several days, some more rural areas were without electricity for weeks, and local flooding caused thousands of dollars in damage. [CLS] [SEP] Moderate to severe damage extended up the Atlantic coastline and as far inland as West Virginia. [CLS] [SEP] Roughly six million people were left without electric service in the eastern United States from the strong winds of Isabel. [CLS] [SEP] Rainfall from the storm extended from South Carolina to Maine, and westward to Michigan. [CLS] [SEP] Throughout the path of Isabel, damage totalled about $5.5 billion (2003 USD). [CLS] [SEP] 16 deaths in seven U.S. [CLS] [SEP] states were directly related to the hurricane, with 35 deaths in six states and one Canadian province indirectly related to the hurricane.
