[CLS] Hurricane Olivia was the first tropical cyclone to make landfall on Maui and Lanai in recorded history. [SEP] [CLS] The fifteenth named storm, ninth hurricane, and sixth major hurricane of the 2018 Pacific hurricane season, Olivia formed southwest of Mexico on September 1. [SEP] [CLS] The depression slowly organized and strengthened into Tropical Storm Olivia on the next day. [SEP] [CLS] Olivia then began a period of rapid intensification on September 3, reaching its initial peak on September 5. [SEP] [CLS] Soon after, Olivia began a weakening trend, before re-intensifying on September 6. [SEP] [CLS] On the next day, Olivia peaked as a Category 4 hurricane, with winds of 130 mph (215 km/h) and a minimum central pressure of 951 mbar (28.08 inHg). [SEP] [CLS] Six hours later, Olivia began another weakening trend that resulted in the hurricane being downgraded to Category 1 status on September 8, east of the 140th meridian west. [SEP] [CLS] On September 9, Olivia entered the Central Pacific Basin. [SEP] [CLS] Over the next couple of days, Olivia prompted the issuance of Tropical Storm Watches and Warnings for Hawaii County, Oahu, Maui County, and Kauai County. [SEP] [CLS] Olivia weakened into a tropical storm on September 11, before making brief landfalls in northwest Maui and Lanai on the next day, becoming the first tropical cyclone to impact the islands in recorded history.
