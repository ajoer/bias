Tropical Cyclone Alessia was the first tropical cyclone to affect the Northern Territory of Australia in November since Cyclone Joan in 1975. [CLS] [SEP] The storm was first identified as a tropical low on 20 November 2013 well to the northwest of Australia. [CLS] [SEP] Tracking generally west to west-southwest, the small system steadily organized into a tropical cyclone by 22 November. [CLS] [SEP] Maintaining a small central dense overcast, Alessia brushed the Kimberley region before making landfall in the Top End region with winds of 65 km/h (40 mph) on 23 and 24 November respectively. [CLS] [SEP] Some weakening took place as the system moved over land; however, reorganization occurred as it neared the Gulf of Carpentaria. [CLS] [SEP] After moving over water on 26 November, it redeveloped gale-force winds. [CLS] [SEP] Alessia reached its peak intensity on 27 November with winds of 85 km/h (50 mph) and a barometric pressure of 991 mbar (hPa; 29.26 inHg) and subsequently made its final landfall near Wollogorang. [CLS] [SEP] Weakening ensued once more as the storm traveled over land; though, Alessia's remnants looped eastward back over water before doubling back to the west. [CLS] [SEP] The system was last noted moving inland again over the Northern Territory on 1 December. [CLS] [SEP] Throughout Alessia's existence, it caused only minimal damage. [CLS] [SEP] Several areas experienced gale-force winds, with gusts measured up to 109 km/h (68 mph) on Centre Island. [CLS] [SEP] Moderate to heavy rains accompanied the system as well, with a storm maxima of 290.4 mm (11.43 in) also occurring on Centre Island. [CLS] [SEP]
