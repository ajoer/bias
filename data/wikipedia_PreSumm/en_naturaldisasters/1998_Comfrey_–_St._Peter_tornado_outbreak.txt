[CLS] The 1998 Comfrey–St. [SEP] [CLS] Peter tornado outbreak was an unseasonably-strong tornado outbreak which affected the Upper Midwest region of the United States on March 29, 1998. [SEP] [CLS] A strong area of low pressure combined with a warm front and favorable upper-level dynamics to produce 16 tornadoes across the region—14 in Minnesota and two in Wisconsin. [SEP] [CLS] Thirteen of the tornadoes in Minnesota were spawned by a single supercell thunderstorm. [SEP] [CLS] This supercell remained intact for approximately 150 miles (240 km) as it moved across the southern part of the state during the late-afternoon hours. [SEP] [CLS] Over $235 million in damage (1998 US$) was recorded from the tornadoes, two people were killed, and 21 others were injured. [SEP] [CLS] Most of the damage was caused by three tornadoes—one rated F4 on the Fujita scale that hit the town of Comfrey, Minnesota, an F3 that hit St. [SEP] [CLS] Peter, Minnesota, and an F2 that hit Le Center, Minnesota. [SEP] [CLS] Gustavus Adolphus College in St. [SEP] [CLS] Peter was especially hard-hit, with several buildings damaged or destroyed, 2,000 trees lost, and nearly 80% of the windows on the campus shattered. [SEP] [CLS] In Comfrey, 75% of the structures in the town were damaged or destroyed, including the local K–12 school. [SEP] [CLS] Seven counties in southern Minnesota were later declared federal disaster areas. [SEP] [CLS] The outbreak broke many early-season tornado records for the state of Minnesota. [SEP] [CLS] The 14 total tornadoes in the state were the most to ever touch down on a single day in March. [SEP] [CLS] The F4 tornado was the strongest ever recorded in the state in March, and its 67-mile (108 km) path the longest tornado path ever recorded in Minnesota. [SEP] [CLS] In December 1998, the United States Department of Commerce awarded a bronze medal to the Twin Cities office of the National Weather Service (NWS) for providing excellent service to the public during the outbreak event.
