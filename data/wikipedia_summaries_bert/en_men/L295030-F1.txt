[CLS] The Tower of Babel (Hebrew: מִגְדַּל בָּבֶל‎‎, Migdal Bavel) narrative in Genesis 11:1–9 is an origin myth meant to explain why the world's peoples speak different languages.According to the story, a united human race in the generations following the Great Flood, speaking a single language and migrating eastward, comes to the land of Shinar (שִׁנְעָר‎). [SEP] [CLS] There they agree to build a city and a tower tall enough to reach heaven. [SEP] [CLS] God, observing their city and tower, confounds their speech so that they can no longer understand each other, and scatters them around the world. [SEP] [CLS] Some modern scholars have associated the Tower of Babel with known structures, notably the Etemenanki, a ziggurat dedicated to the Mesopotamian god Marduk in Babylon. [SEP] [CLS] A Sumerian story with some similar elements is told in Enmerkar and the Lord of Aratta. [SEP] [CLS]
