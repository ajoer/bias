The 1943 Surprise hurricane was the first hurricane to be entered by a reconnaissance aircraft. [CLS] [SEP] The first tracked tropical cyclone of the 1943 Atlantic hurricane season, this system developed as a tropical storm while situated over the northeastern Gulf of Mexico on July 25. [CLS] [SEP] The storm gradually strengthened while tracking westward and reached hurricane status late on July 26. [CLS] [SEP] Thereafter, the hurricane curved slightly west-northwestward and continued intensifying. [CLS] [SEP] Early on July 27, it became a Category 2 hurricane on the modern-day Saffirâ€“Simpson hurricane wind scale and peaked with winds of 105 mph (165 km/h). [CLS] [SEP] The system maintained this intensity until landfall on the Bolivar Peninsula in Texas late on July 27. [CLS] [SEP] After moving inland, the storm initially weakened rapidly, but remained a tropical cyclone until dissipating over north-central Texas on July 29. [CLS] [SEP] Because the storm occurred during World War II, information and reports were censored by the Government of the United States and news media. [CLS] [SEP] Advisories also had to be cleared through the Weather Bureau office in New Orleans, resulting in late releases. [CLS] [SEP] This in turn delayed preparations ahead of the storm. [CLS] [SEP] In Louisiana, the storm produced gusty winds and heavy rains, though no damage occurred. [CLS] [SEP] The storm was considered the worst in Texas since the 1915 Galveston hurricane. [CLS] [SEP] Wind gusts up to 132 mph (212 km/h) were reported in the Galveston-Houston area. [CLS] [SEP] Numerous buildings and houses were damaged or destroyed. [CLS] [SEP] The storm caused 19 fatalities, 14 of which occurred after two separate ships sunk. [CLS] [SEP] Overall, damage reached approximately $17 million (1943 USD). [CLS] [SEP]
