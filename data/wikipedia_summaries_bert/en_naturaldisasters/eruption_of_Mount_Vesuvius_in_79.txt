Of the many eruptions of Mount Vesuvius in Italy, the most famous is the eruption in 79 AD. [CLS] [SEP] This eruption is one of the deadliest in European history.Mount Vesuvius violently spewed forth a deadly cloud of super-heated tephra and gases to a height of 33 km (21 mi), ejecting molten rock, pulverized pumice and hot ash at 1.5 million tons per second, ultimately releasing 100,000 times the thermal energy of the Hiroshima-Nagasaki bombings. [CLS] [SEP] The event gives its name to the Vesuvian type of volcanic eruptions, characterised by eruption columns of hot gases and ash exploding into the stratosphere, although the event also included pyroclastic flows associated with Pelean eruptions. [CLS] [SEP] Several Roman cities were obliterated and buried underneath massive pyroclastic surges and ashfall deposits, the best known being Pompeii and Herculaneum. [CLS] [SEP] After archaeological excavations revealed much about the lives of the inhabitants, the area became a major tourist attraction, and is now a UNESCO World Heritage Site, and part of Vesuvius National Park. [CLS] [SEP] The total population of both cities was over 20,000. [CLS] [SEP] The remains of over 1,500 people have so far been found at Pompeii and Herculaneum, although the total death toll remains unknown. [CLS] [SEP]
