[CLS] The December 2000 nor'easter was a significant winter storm that impacted the Mid-Atlantic and New England regions of the United States around the end of the month. [SEP] [CLS] It began as an Alberta clipper that moved southeastward through the central United States and weakened over the Ohio Valley. [SEP] [CLS] However, it redeveloped off the coast of North Carolina and moved northward as it intensified. [SEP] [CLS] It moved into central Long Island and eventually tracked northward into New England. [SEP] [CLS] The storm dropped heavy precipitation throughout the Northeast, especially in northern New Jersey and eastern New York, where snowfall often exceeded 2 ft (0.61 m).
