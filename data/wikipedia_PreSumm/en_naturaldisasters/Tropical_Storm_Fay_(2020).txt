[CLS] Tropical Storm Fay was the first tropical cyclone to make landfall in the U.S state of New Jersey since Irene in 2011. [SEP] [CLS] The sixth named storm of the 2020 Atlantic hurricane season, Fay was the earliest sixth named storm on record in the basin when it formed on July 9. [SEP] [CLS] Fay originated from a surface low that formed over the northern Gulf of Mexico on July 3 and slowly drifted east before crossing over the Florida Panhandle and drifting across the southeastern United States as a well-defined surface low, emerging off the coast of North Carolina on July 8. [SEP] [CLS] From there, the storm utilized favorable conditions for cyclogenesis and coalesced into a tropical storm on July 9. [SEP] [CLS] The storm intensified before shifting west and landfalling in New Jersey later on July 10. [SEP] [CLS] After making landfall, the storm lost deep convection and degenerated into a post-tropical cyclone on July 11. [SEP] [CLS] Fay brought high winds and stormy weather to much of the Mid-Atlantic and the Northeastern United States, with the heaviest rains west of Long Island. [SEP] [CLS] Six people were killed by rip currents and flooding related to the storm. [SEP] [CLS] Many intenstates and other principle highways throughout the Philadelphia and New York City Metro were flooded and impassable, leading to widespread road closures and disruption to commuters. [SEP] [CLS] Downed trees and wires caused power outages in Pennsylvania and New Jersey. [SEP] [CLS] Overall, Fay caused an estimated US$400 million in damage to the U.S. [SEP] [CLS] East coast.
