[CLS] Tropical Storm Nicholas was a long-lived tropical storm in October and November of the 2003 Atlantic hurricane season. [SEP] [CLS] Forming from a tropical wave on October 13 in the central tropical Atlantic Ocean, Nicholas slowly developed due to moderate levels of wind shear throughout its lifetime. [SEP] [CLS] Deep convection slowly organized, and Nicholas attained a peak intensity of 70 mph (110 km/h) on October 17. [SEP] [CLS] After moving west-northwestward for much of its lifetime, it turned northward and weakened due to increasing shear. [SEP] [CLS] The storm again turned to the west and briefly restrengthened, but after turning again to the north Nicholas transitioned to an extratropical cyclone on October 24. [SEP] [CLS] As an extratropical storm, Nicholas executed a large loop to the west, and after moving erratically for a week and organizing into a tropical low, it was absorbed by a non-tropical low. [SEP] [CLS] The low continued westward, crossed Florida, and ultimately dissipated over the Gulf Coast of the United States on November 5. [SEP] [CLS] Nicholas had no impact as a tropical cyclone, and impact from the low that absorbed the storm was limited to rainfall, gusty winds, and rough surf. [SEP] [CLS] Nicholas extended the above-average levels of tropical cyclone activity throughout the 2003 season, and was one of fourteen seasons to reach fourteen storms. [SEP] [CLS] The low that absorbed the storm nearly developed into a tropical cyclone, which would have been called Odette. [SEP] [CLS] However, moderate wind shear prevented further development.
