[CLS] The Hpakant jade mine disaster was a mining disaster in which a landslide killed at least 174 miners, while at least 100 went missing, and an additional 54 people were injured in a jade mining site in the Hpakant area of Kachin State in Myanmar. [SEP] [CLS] The disaster took place on 2 July 2020 and is the deadliest mining accident to date in Myanmar. [SEP] [CLS] Myanmar's jade industry is worth US$790 million per Myanmar's official statistics, but independent estimates put it at US$30â€“31 billion worth per year. [SEP] [CLS] The industry had become known for its fatal accidents in the preceding years, with the previous deadliest accident in 2015 killing 116 people. [SEP] [CLS] While the government responded with promises to make reforms in the jade mining industry, activists claim that little has been done in practice since then. [SEP] [CLS] The miners killed or injured by the landslide were independent "jade pickers", who scavenge tailings from larger operators and who live in ramshackle quarters at the base of large mounds of rubble excavated by heavy machinery. [SEP] [CLS] The day before the disaster authorities warned them of the dangers created by heavy rainfall. [SEP] [CLS] This warning was ignored by many miners. [SEP] [CLS] At 06:30 local time heavy rains triggered the collapse of a heap of mining waste, which came tumbling down into a lake. [SEP] [CLS] This then generated a 6.1-meter (20 ft) wave of mud and water that buried those working at the site. [SEP] [CLS]
