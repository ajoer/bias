The 1930 Salmas earthquake occurred on May 7 at 01:34:26 IRST in West Azerbaijan Province, Iran. [CLS] [SEP] The earthquake, which was among Iran's largest, measured 7.1 on the moment magnitude scale and had a maximum Mercalli intensity of IX (Violent). [CLS] [SEP] A damaging foreshock occurred fifteen hours prior to the main event and served as a warning to the people that felt it strongly. [CLS] [SEP] Reports from seismologists and seismological organizations indicate that up to 3,000 fatalities may have occurred in northwest Iran and southeast Turkey. [CLS] [SEP] Sixty villages (including the large settlement of Dilman, which was relocated and rebuilt as Salmas) were destroyed in the Salmas Plain and in the surrounding mountainous regions. [CLS] [SEP] A destructive aftershock sequence affected many villages, and in some cases, damage was inflicted on some that had escaped devastation during the mainshock. [CLS] [SEP] An inspection of the region was undertaken, but not until decades later, at which time substantial surface faulting and other ground effects were documented. [CLS] [SEP]
