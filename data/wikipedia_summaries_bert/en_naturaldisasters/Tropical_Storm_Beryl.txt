Tropical Storm Beryl was the strongest off-season Atlantic tropical cyclone on record to make landfall in the United States. [CLS] [SEP] The second tropical cyclone of the 2012 Atlantic hurricane season, Beryl developed on May 26 from a low-pressure system offshore North Carolina. [CLS] [SEP] Initially subtropical, the storm slowly acquired tropical characteristics as it tracked across warmer sea surface temperatures and within an environment of decreasing vertical wind shear. [CLS] [SEP] Late on May 27, Beryl transitioned into a tropical cyclone less than 120 miles (190 km) from North Florida. [CLS] [SEP] Early the following day, the storm moved ashore near Jacksonville Beach, Florida, with peak winds of 65 mph (100 km/h). [CLS] [SEP] It quickly weakened to a tropical depression, dropping heavy rainfall while moving slowly across the southeastern United States. [CLS] [SEP] A cold front turned Beryl to the northeast, and the storm became extratropical on May 30. [CLS] [SEP] The precursor to Beryl produced heavy rainfall in Cuba, causing flooding, mudslides and two deaths. [CLS] [SEP] Torrential rain also affected south Florida and the Bahamas. [CLS] [SEP] After forming, Beryl produced rough surf along the US southeastern coast, leaving one person from Folly Beach, South Carolina missing. [CLS] [SEP] Upon making landfall in Florida, the storm produced strong winds that left 38,000 people without power. [CLS] [SEP] High rains alleviated drought conditions and put out wildfires along the storm's path. [CLS] [SEP] A fallen tree killed a man driving in Orangeburg County, South Carolina. [CLS] [SEP] In northeast North Carolina, Beryl spawned an EF1 tornado that snapped trees and damaged dozens of homes near the city of Peletier. [CLS] [SEP] Overall damage was minor, estimated at $148,000. [CLS] [SEP]
