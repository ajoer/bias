The 1997 Atlantic hurricane season was a below-average season and is the most recent season to feature no tropical cyclones in August – typically one of the most active months. [CLS] [SEP] The season officially began on June 1, and lasted until November 30. [CLS] [SEP] These dates conventionally delimit the period of each year when most tropical cyclones form in the Atlantic basin. [CLS] [SEP] The 1997 season was inactive, with only seven named storms forming, with an additional tropical depression and an unnumbered subtropical storm. [CLS] [SEP] It was the first time since the 1961 season that there were no active tropical cyclones in the Atlantic basin during the entire month of August. [CLS] [SEP] A strong El Niño is credited with reducing the number of storms in the Atlantic, while increasing the number of storms in the Eastern and Western Pacific basin to 19 and 29 storms, respectively. [CLS] [SEP] As is common in El Niño years, tropical cyclogenesis was suppressed in the tropical latitudes, with only two becoming tropical storms south of 25°N. [CLS] [SEP] The first system, an operationally unnoticed subtropical storm, developed north of The Bahamas on June 1 and dissipated by the following day without impact. [CLS] [SEP] Tropical Storm Ana developed offshore South Carolina on June 30 and dissipated on July 4, after causing minor affects in North Carolina. [CLS] [SEP] Hurricane Bill was a short-lived storm between that lasted from July 11 to 13 and produced light rainfall in Newfoundland. [CLS] [SEP] As Bill was dissipating, Tropical Storm Claudette developed and caused rough seas in North Carolina. [CLS] [SEP] The most devastating storm was Hurricane Danny, which caused extensive flooding, particularly in southern Alabama. [CLS] [SEP] Danny resulted in 9 fatalities and about $100 million (1997 USD) in damage. [CLS] [SEP] The outer bands of Hurricane Erika brought rough seas and gusty winds to the Lesser Antilles, causing two deaths and $10 million in losses. [CLS] [SEP] The precursor to Tropical Storm Grace caused minor flooding in Puerto Rico. [CLS] [SEP] Tropical Depression Five and Tropical Storms Fabian did not impact land. [CLS] [SEP] Collectively, the storms of the 1997 Atlantic hurricane season resulted in 12 fatalities and approximately $111.46 million in damage. [CLS] [SEP]
