[CLS] The 1980 Pacific typhoon season has no official bounds; it ran year-round in 1980, but most tropical cyclones tend to form in the northwestern Pacific Ocean between June and December. [SEP] [CLS] These dates conventionally delimit the period of each year when most tropical cyclones form in the northwestern Pacific Ocean. [SEP] [CLS] Tropical storms which formed in the entire west Pacific basin were assigned a name by the Joint Typhoon Warning Center. [SEP] [CLS] Tropical depressions that enter or form in the Philippine area of responsibility are assigned a name by the Philippine Atmospheric, Geophysical and Astronomical Services Administration or PAGASA. [SEP] [CLS] This can often result in the same storm having two names. [SEP] [CLS] A total of 28 tropical depressions formed this year in the Western Pacific, of which 24 became tropical storms. [SEP] [CLS] Beginning in March, tropical cyclones formed in each subsequent month through December. [SEP] [CLS] Of the 28, 15 storms reached typhoon intensity, of which 2 reached super typhoon strength. [SEP] [CLS] Seven tropical cyclones moved through the Philippines this season. [SEP] [CLS]
