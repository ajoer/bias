The 1952 Bermuda air crash occurred on 6 December 1952, when a Douglas DC-4, registered CU-T397 and operated by Cubana de Aviaci√≥n, flying from Madrid to Havana, crashed into the Atlantic Ocean following a refuelling stop at Kindley Air Force Base in Bermuda. [CLS] [SEP] There were 33 passengers and 8 crew on board the aircraft. [CLS] [SEP] The flight arrived at Kindley Air Force Base at 03:30. [CLS] [SEP] After an hour's stopover spent refuelling the aircraft, the DC-4 departed; at 04:45, during the initial climb, the aircraft stalled, lost height and crashed tail first into the sea. [CLS] [SEP] The accident killed 37 passengers and crew; three passengers and a crewmember survived the crash, and were rescued shortly after the crash. [CLS] [SEP] Bermuda's Director of Civil Aviation, E. [CLS] [SEP] M. [CLS] [SEP] Ware, said at the time that the take-off apparently had been normal. [CLS] [SEP] It is believed no message came from the plane before it plunged into the sea, probably while still pushing the engines hard to gain altitude. [CLS] [SEP] Four survivors were taken to the Kindley base hospital. [CLS] [SEP] The cause of the accident was not determined; it remains the worst aviation accident in Bermudian history.
