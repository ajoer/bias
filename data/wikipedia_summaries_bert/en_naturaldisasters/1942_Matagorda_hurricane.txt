[CLS] The 1942 Matagorda hurricane was the most intense and costliest tropical cyclone of the 1942 Atlantic hurricane season. [SEP] [CLS] The second tropical storm and hurricane, as well as the first major hurricane of the year, it originated from a tropical wave near the island of St. [SEP] [CLS] Lucia on August 21. [SEP] [CLS] Moving generally westward across the Caribbean Sea, the storm remained weak for much of its early existence. [SEP] [CLS] However, it gradually intensified, and reach hurricane strength south of Jamaica on August 25 before coming ashore the Yucatán Peninsula late on August 27. [SEP] [CLS] Once in the Gulf of Mexico, the hurricane quickly strengthened, and attained its peak intensity on August 29 as a Category 3 hurricane with winds of 115 mph (185 km/h). [SEP] [CLS] However, nearing the Texas Gulf Coast, the storm waned in intensity, and was only a Category 1 hurricane by the time it made a final landfall near Matagorda, Texas on August 30. [SEP] [CLS] Continuing inland, the hurricane weakened, and dissipated into a remnant low on August 31. [SEP] [CLS] At the hurricane's first landfall near the northeastern tip of the Yucatán Peninsula, little information was documented on the storm's impacts. [SEP] [CLS] However, as the storm approached the Texas coast, widespread evacuations took place, including the evacuation of roughly 50,000 people from Galveston, Texas alone. [SEP] [CLS] Upon making landfall, the hurricane caused extensive damage in coastal regions. [SEP] [CLS] In Matagorda, storm surge peaking at 14.7 ft (4.5 m) inundated the city and damaged many others. [SEP] [CLS] Strong winds from the storm wreaked havoc as far inland as San Antonio, Texas. [SEP] [CLS] The winds leveled numerous buildings and uprooted trees, in addition to causing widespread power outages. [SEP] [CLS] Crops in the areas affected saw large losses, particularly the rice crop. [SEP] [CLS] Rainfall associated with the storm was relatively light, due to the hurricane's rapid forward motion once inland, peaking at 9.3 in (0.24 m) in Woodsboro, Texas. [SEP] [CLS] Overall, the storm caused $26.5 million in damages and eight deaths. [SEP] [CLS]
