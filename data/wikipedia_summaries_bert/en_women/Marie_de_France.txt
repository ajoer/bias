Marie de France (fl. [CLS] [SEP] 1160 to 1215) was a poet, possibly born in what is now France, who lived in England during the late 12th century. [CLS] [SEP] She lived and wrote at an unknown court, but she and her work were almost certainly known at the royal court of King Henry II of England. [CLS] [SEP] Virtually nothing is known of her life; both her given name and its geographical specification come from her manuscripts. [CLS] [SEP] However, one written description of her work and popularity from her own era still exists. [CLS] [SEP] She is considered by scholars to be the first woman known to write francophone verse.Marie de France wrote in Francien, with some Anglo-Norman influence. [CLS] [SEP] She was proficient in Latin, as were most authors and scholars of that era, as well as Middle English and possibly Breton. [CLS] [SEP] She is the author of the Lais of Marie de France. [CLS] [SEP] She translated Aesop's Fables from Middle English into Anglo-Norman French and wrote Espurgatoire seint Partiz, Legend of the Purgatory of St. [CLS] [SEP] Patrick, based upon a Latin text. [CLS] [SEP] Recently, she has been (tentatively) identified as the author of a saint's life, The Life of Saint Audrey. [CLS] [SEP] Her Lais were and still are widely read and influenced the subsequent development of the romance/heroic literature genre. [CLS] [SEP]
