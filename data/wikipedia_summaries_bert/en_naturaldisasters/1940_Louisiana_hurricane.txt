[CLS] The 1940 Louisiana hurricane caused record flooding across much of the Southern United States in August 1940. [SEP] [CLS] The second tropical cyclone and hurricane of the annual hurricane season, it formed from a frontal low off the west coast of Florida on August 3. [SEP] [CLS] Initially a weak disturbance, it moved generally westward, slowly gaining in intensity. [SEP] [CLS] Early on August 4, the depression attained tropical storm intensity. [SEP] [CLS] Ships in the vicinity of the storm reported a much stronger tropical cyclone than initially suggested. [SEP] [CLS] After reaching hurricane strength on August 5 south of the Mississippi River Delta, the storm strengthened further into a Category 2 hurricane with maximum sustained winds of 100 mph and a minimum barometric pressure of 972 mbar (hPa; 28.71 inHg) at 0600 UTC on August 7. [SEP] [CLS] The hurricane moved ashore near Sabine Pass, Texas later that day at peak strength. [SEP] [CLS] Once inland, the storm executed a sharp curve to the north and quickly weakened, degenerating into a tropical storm on August 8 before dissipating over Arkansas on August 10. [SEP] [CLS] Reports of a potentially destructive hurricane near the United States Gulf Coast forced thousands of residents in low-lying areas to evacuate prior to the storm moving inland. [SEP] [CLS] Offshore, the hurricane generated rough seas and a strong storm surge, peaking at 6.4 ft (1.95 m) on the western edge of Lake Pontchartrain. [SEP] [CLS] The anomalously high tides flooded many of Louisiana's outlying islands, inundating resorts. [SEP] [CLS] Strong winds caused moderate infrastructural damage, primarily in Texas, though its impact was mainly to communication networks along the US Gulf Coast which were disrupted by the winds. [SEP] [CLS] However, much of the property and crop damage wrought by the hurricane was due to the torrential rainfall it produced in low-lying areas, setting off record floods. [SEP] [CLS] Rainfall peaked at 37.5 in (953 mm) in Miller Island off Louisiana, making it the wettest tropical cyclone in state history. [SEP] [CLS] Nineteen official weather stations in both Texas and Louisiana recorded record-level 24-hour rainfall totals for the month of August as a result of the slow-moving hurricane. [SEP] [CLS] Property, livestock, and crops–especially cotton, corn, and pecan crops–were heavily damaged. [SEP] [CLS] Entire ecosystems were also altered by the rainfall. [SEP] [CLS] Overall, the storm caused $10.75 million in damages and seven fatalities. [SEP] [CLS]
