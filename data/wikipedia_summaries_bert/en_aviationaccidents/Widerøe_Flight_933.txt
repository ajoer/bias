Widerøe Flight 933, also known as the Mehamn Accident (Norwegian: Mehamn-ulykken), was the crash of a de Havilland Canada DHC-6 Twin Otter operated by Norwegian airline Widerøe. [CLS] [SEP] The Twin Otter crashed into the Barents Sea off Gamvik, Norway on 11 March 1982 at 13:27, killing all fifteen people on board. [CLS] [SEP] The results of the four official investigations were that the accident was caused by structural failure of the vertical stabilizer during clear-air turbulence. [CLS] [SEP] A mechanical fault in the elevator control system caused the pilots to lose control of pitch); and either a series of stalls or a high-speed gust of wind caused the aircraft to lose altitude without the ability of the crew to counteract, resulting in the failure of the vertical stabilizer. [CLS] [SEP] The accident occurred during a NATO military exercise, within a self-declared no-fly zone for allied military aircraft. [CLS] [SEP] An extensive search and rescue operation was carried out and the submerged wreck was found on 13 March. [CLS] [SEP] The aircraft and all but one of the deceased were retrieved. [CLS] [SEP] An official investigation was concluded on 20 July 1984. [CLS] [SEP] A conspiracy theory later emerged after the accident investigation was concluded, claiming that the accident was caused by a mid-air collision with a Harrier Jump Jet of the British Royal Air Force. [CLS] [SEP] The theory is based on reports which emerged years or decades after the accident. [CLS] [SEP] The claims and renewed press interest resulted in three additional investigations, established in 1987, 1997 and 2002. [CLS] [SEP] All four investigations came to the same general conclusions and rejected a collision. [CLS] [SEP]
