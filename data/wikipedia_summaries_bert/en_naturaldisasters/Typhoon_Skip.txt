Typhoon Skip, known in the Philippines as Typhoon Yoning, was the final of three tropical cyclones in 1988 to directly impact the Philippines in a two-week time frame. [CLS] [SEP] Several areas of disturbed weather developed within the monsoon trough around November 1. [CLS] [SEP] One area situated to the south of Guam gradually became better organized, and by late November 3, the system was upgraded into a tropical depression, and a tropical storm later that day. [CLS] [SEP] Steady deepening ensued as Skip veered west and the cyclone was upgraded into a typhoon on November 5. [CLS] [SEP] The next day, Skip attained its maximum intensity of 145 km/h (90 mph). [CLS] [SEP] Shortly after its peak, weakening ensued as the storm tracked across the Philippines. [CLS] [SEP] This trend continued once the cyclone entered the South China Sea, initially as a severe tropical storm late on November 7. [CLS] [SEP] Slowing down in forward motion, Skip briefly turned west-northwest, then west and finally turned west-southwest before dissipating on November 12. [CLS] [SEP] Typhoon Skip brought widespread impact to much of the already battered country. [CLS] [SEP] On Cebu island, almost 20,000 people were trapped in floodwaters.
