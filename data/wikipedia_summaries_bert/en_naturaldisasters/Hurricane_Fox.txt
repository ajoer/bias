[CLS] Hurricane Fox was the strongest and deadliest tropical cyclone of the below average 1952 Atlantic hurricane season. [SEP] [CLS] The seventh tropical storm, sixth Atlantic hurricane, and the third major hurricane of the season, Fox was a small and intense Caribbean storm that developed northwest of Cartagena, Colombia, in the southern Caribbean Sea. [SEP] [CLS] It moved steadily northwest, intensifying to a tropical storm on October 21. [SEP] [CLS] The next day, it rapidly strengthened into a hurricane and turned north passing closely to Grand Cayman, Cayman Islands. [SEP] [CLS] The cyclone attained peak winds of 150 mph (240 km/h) as it struck Cayo Guano del Este off the coast of Cienfuegos. [SEP] [CLS] Fox made landfall on Cuba at maximum intensity, producing peak gusts of 170–180 mph (275–290 km/h). [SEP] [CLS] It weakened over land, but it re-strengthened as it turned east over the Bahamas. [SEP] [CLS] On October 26, it weakened and took an erratic path, dissipating west-southwest of Bermuda on October 28. [SEP] [CLS] Hurricane Fox was the second most intense hurricane to strike Cuba until Hurricane Michelle in the 2001 Atlantic hurricane season. [SEP] [CLS] It was originally believed to have been the second Category 4 hurricane in Cuba prior to the Atlantic hurricane reanalysis.
