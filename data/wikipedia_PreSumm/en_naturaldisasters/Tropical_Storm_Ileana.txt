[CLS] Tropical Storm Ileana was a small tropical cyclone that affected western Mexico in early August 2018, causing multiple deaths and flooding. [SEP] [CLS] The eleventh tropical cyclone and ninth named storm of the 2018 Pacific hurricane season, Ileana originated from a tropical wave that the National Hurricane Center began monitoring on July 26 as the wave left the west coast of Africa. [SEP] [CLS] The wave traveled across the Atlantic Ocean with no thunderstorm activity, before crossing into the Eastern Pacific Ocean early on August 4. [SEP] [CLS] Rapidly developing, the disturbance organized into a tropical depression on the evening of the same day. [SEP] [CLS] Initially, the depression was well-defined, but it soon degraded due to northerly wind shear. [SEP] [CLS] Despite the unfavorable conditions, the system began to strengthen on August 5, becoming Tropical Storm Ileana. [SEP] [CLS] A day later, on August 6, Ileana began to develop an eyewall structure as it reached its peak intensity with winds of 65 mph (100 km/h) and a pressure of 998 mbar (29.47 inHg). [SEP] [CLS] The storm gradually became intertwined with the nearby Hurricane John; over the next day, the circulation of John disrupted Ileana before ultimately absorbing it on August 7. [SEP] [CLS] Ileana prompted the issuance of multiple watches and warnings along the coast of Baja California Sur and western Mexico. [SEP] [CLS] The system paralleled the coast of Mexico for much of its existence. [SEP] [CLS] Ileana caused a total of eight deaths in Mexico; four people were killed in Guerrero and another four died in Chiapas. [SEP] [CLS] Flooding also ensued in the Mexican states of Oaxaca, Guerrero, and Mexico. [SEP] [CLS]
