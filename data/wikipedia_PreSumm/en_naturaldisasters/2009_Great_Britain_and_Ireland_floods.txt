[CLS] The 2009 Great Britain and Ireland floods were a weather event that affected parts of Great Britain and Ireland throughout November and into December 2009. [SEP] [CLS] November was the wettest month across the United Kingdom since records began in 1914 and had well above average temperatures. [SEP] [CLS] The worst affected area in Great Britain was the English county of Cumbria. [SEP] [CLS] The Irish counties of Clare, Cork, Galway and Westmeath were among the worst affected areas of Ireland. [SEP] [CLS] European windstorms bringing heavy rain and gale-force winds caused damage and flooding to the south of Great Britain on 13–14 November. [SEP] [CLS] Unsettled weather continued across the south and later to the north. [SEP] [CLS] On 19–20 November, many towns and villages in Cumbria and Dumfries and Galloway were affected.

[SEP] [CLS] In Powys, there were two deaths, at Newtown and Talybont-on-Usk. [SEP] [CLS] Among the many places severely flooded was the Republic of Ireland's second largest city, Cork.
