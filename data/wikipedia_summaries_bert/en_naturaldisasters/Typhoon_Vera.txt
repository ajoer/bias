[CLS] Typhoon Vera, also known as the Isewan Typhoon (伊勢湾台風, Ise-wan Taifū), was an exceptionally intense tropical cyclone that struck Japan in September 1959, becoming the strongest and deadliest typhoon on record to make landfall on the country. [SEP] [CLS] The storm's intensity resulted in catastrophic damage of unparalleled severity and extent, and was a major setback to the Japanese economy, which was still recovering from World War II. [SEP] [CLS] In the aftermath of Vera, Japan's disaster management and relief systems were significantly reformed, and the typhoon's effects would set a benchmark for future storms striking the country. [SEP] [CLS] Vera developed on September 20 between Guam and Chuuk State, and initially tracked westward before taking a more northerly course, reaching tropical storm strength the following day. [SEP] [CLS] By this point Vera had assumed a more westerly direction of movement and had begun to rapidly intensify, and reached its peak intensity on September 23 with maximum sustained winds equivalent to that of a modern-day Category 5 hurricane. [SEP] [CLS] With little change in strength, Vera curved and accelerated northward, resulting in a landfall on September 26 near Shionomisaki on Honshu. [SEP] [CLS] Atmospheric wind patterns caused the typhoon to briefly emerge into the Sea of Japan before recurving eastward and moving ashore Honshu for a second time. [SEP] [CLS] Movement over land greatly weakened Vera, and after reentering the North Pacific Ocean later that day, Vera transitioned into an extratropical cyclone on September 27; these remnants continued to persist for an additional two days. [SEP] [CLS] Though Vera was accurately forecast and its track into Japan was well anticipated, limited coverage of telecommunications, combined with lack of urgency from Japanese media and the storm's intensity, greatly inhibited potential evacuation and disaster mitigation processes. [SEP] [CLS] Rainfall from the storm's outer rainbands began to cause flooding in river basins well in advance of the storm's landfall. [SEP] [CLS] Upon moving ashore Honshu, the typhoon brought a strong storm surge that destroyed numerous flood defense systems, inundating coastal regions and sinking ships. [SEP] [CLS] Damage totals from Vera reached US$600 million (equivalent to US$5.26 billion in 2019). [SEP] [CLS] The number of fatalities caused by Vera remain discrepant, though current estimates indicate that the typhoon caused more than 5,000 deaths, making it one of the deadliest typhoons in Japanese history. [SEP] [CLS] It also injured almost 39,000 people and made around 1.5 million people homeless.Relief efforts were initiated by Japanese and American governments immediately following Typhoon Vera. [SEP] [CLS] Due to the inundation caused by the typhoon, localized epidemics were reported, including those of dysentery and tetanus. [SEP] [CLS] The spread of disease and blocking debris slowed the ongoing relief efforts. [SEP] [CLS] Due to the unprecedented damage and loss of life following Vera, the National Diet passed legislation in order to more efficiently assist affected regions and mitigate future disasters. [SEP] [CLS] This included the passage of the Disaster Countermeasures Basic Act in 1961, which set standards for Japanese disaster relief, including the establishment of the Central Disaster Prevention Council.
