[CLS] Sappho (; Greek: Σαπφώ Sapphō [sap.pʰɔ̌ː]; Aeolic Greek Ψάπφω Psápphō; c. [SEP] [CLS] 630 – c. [SEP] [CLS] 570 BC) was an Archaic Greek poet from the island of Lesbos. [SEP] [CLS] Sappho is known for her lyric poetry, written to be sung while accompanied by a lyre. [SEP] [CLS] In ancient times, Sappho was widely regarded as one of the greatest lyric poets and was given names such as the "Tenth Muse" and "The Poetess". [SEP] [CLS] Most of Sappho's poetry is now lost, and what is extant has mostly survived in fragmentary form; two notable exceptions are the "Ode to Aphrodite" and the Tithonus poem. [SEP] [CLS] As well as lyric poetry, ancient commentators claimed that Sappho wrote elegiac and iambic poetry. [SEP] [CLS] Three epigrams attributed to Sappho are extant, but these are actually Hellenistic imitations of Sappho's style. [SEP] [CLS] Little is known of Sappho's life. [SEP] [CLS] She was from a wealthy family from Lesbos, though her parents' names are uncertain. [SEP] [CLS] Ancient sources say that she had three brothers; the names of two of them, Charaxos and Larichos, are mentioned in the Brothers Poem discovered in 2014. [SEP] [CLS] She was exiled to Sicily around 600 BC, and may have continued to work until around 570. [SEP] [CLS] Later legends surrounding Sappho's love for the ferryman Phaon and her death are unreliable. [SEP] [CLS] Sappho was a prolific poet, probably composing around 10,000 lines. [SEP] [CLS] Her poetry was well-known and greatly admired through much of antiquity, and she was among the canon of nine lyric poets most highly esteemed by scholars of Hellenistic Alexandria. [SEP] [CLS] Sappho's poetry is still considered extraordinary and her works continue to influence other writers. [SEP] [CLS] Beyond her poetry, she is well known as a symbol of love and desire between women, with the English words sapphic and lesbian being derived from her own name and the name of her home island respectively. [SEP] [CLS] Whilst her importance as a poet is confirmed from the earliest times, all interpretations of her work have been coloured and influenced by discussions of her sexuality. [SEP] [CLS]
