[CLS] François Maurice Adrien Marie Mitterrand (26 October 1916 – 8 January 1996) was a French statesman who served as President of France from 1981 to 1995, the longest time in office in the history of France. [SEP] [CLS] As First Secretary of the Socialist Party, he was the first left-wing politician to assume the presidency under the Fifth Republic. [SEP] [CLS] Reflecting family influences, François Mitterrand started political life on the Catholic nationalist right. [SEP] [CLS] He served under the Vichy Regime during its earlier years. [SEP] [CLS] Subsequently he joined the Resistance, moved to the left, and held ministerial office several times under the Fourth Republic. [SEP] [CLS] François Mitterand opposed de Gaulle's establishment of the Fifth Republic. [SEP] [CLS] Although at times a politically isolated figure, François Mitterrand outmanoeuvered rivals to become the left's standard bearer at every presidential election from 1965–88, with the exception of 1969. [SEP] [CLS] François Mitterrand was elected President at the 1981 presidential election. [SEP] [CLS] He was re-elected in 1988 and remained in office until 1995. [SEP] [CLS] François Mitterrand invited the Communist Party into his first government, which was a controversial decision at the time. [SEP] [CLS] In the event, the Communists were boxed in as junior partners and, rather than taking advantage, saw their support erode. [SEP] [CLS] They left the cabinet in 1984. [SEP] [CLS] Early in his first term, François Mitterrand followed a radical left-wing economic agenda, including nationalisation of key firms, but after two years, with the economy in crisis, he reversed course. [SEP] [CLS] He pushed a socially liberal agenda with reforms such as the abolition of the death penalty, the 39-hour work week, and the end of a government monopoly in radio and television broadcasting. [SEP] [CLS] His foreign and defense policies built on those of his Gaullist predecessors. [SEP] [CLS] His partnership with German Chancellor Helmut Kohl advanced European integration via the Maastricht Treaty, but he reluctantly accepted German reunification. [SEP] [CLS] During his time in office, he was a strong promoter of culture and implemented a range of costly "Grands Projets". [SEP] [CLS] He is the only French President to ever have named a female Prime Minister, Édith Cresson, in 1991. [SEP] [CLS] François Mitterrand was twice forced by the loss of a parliamentary majority into "cohabitation governments" with conservative cabinets led, respectively, by Jacques Chirac (1986–1988), and Édouard Balladur (1993–1995). [SEP] [CLS] Less than eight months after leaving office, Mitterrand died from the prostate cancer he had successfully concealed for most of his presidency. [SEP] [CLS] Beyond making the French left electable, François Mitterrand presided over the rise of the Socialist Party to dominance of the left, and the decline of the once-mighty Communist Party (as a share of the popular vote in the first presidential round, the Communists shrank from a peak of 21.27% in 1969 to 8.66% in 1995, at the end of François Mitterrand's second term).
