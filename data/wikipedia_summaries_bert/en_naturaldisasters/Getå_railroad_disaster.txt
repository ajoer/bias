The Getå Railroad Disaster (Swedish: Järnvägsolyckan i Getå) was a train disaster caused by a landslide in Getå, a town that is now part of the municipality of Norrköping on 1 October 1918. [CLS] [SEP] To date, it is the worst rail accident in Swedish history. [CLS] [SEP] The derailment occurred when the layers of colloidal clay and gravel in the embankment that had been cut into the hill gave way. [CLS] [SEP] Shortly afterwards, a mixed train consisting of a locomotive and ten cars came down the tracks, falling down the embankment and landing on the road below. [CLS] [SEP] Of the passengers and crew on board that night, 41 people were injured and at least 42 were killed or died later from injuries sustained in the crash. [CLS] [SEP] It is unclear how many died in the derailment compared to those who died in the blaze that followed it. [CLS] [SEP] Many of the passengers were burned alive as the unreinforced wooden cars caught fire, killing those who had survived the crash itself but were still trapped in the wreckage. [CLS] [SEP]
