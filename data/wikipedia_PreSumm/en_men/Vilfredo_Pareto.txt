[CLS] Vilfredo Federico Damaso Pareto (UK: pa-RAY-toh, -⁠EE-, US: pə-RAY-toh, Italian: [vilˈfreːdo paˈreːto], Ligurian: [paˈɾeːtu]; born Wilfried Fritz Pareto; 15 July 1848 – 19 August 1923) was an Italian engineer, sociologist, economist, political scientist, and philosopher. [SEP] [CLS] He made several important contributions to economics, particularly in the study of income distribution and in the analysis of individuals' choices. [SEP] [CLS] He was also responsible for popularising the use of the term "elite" in social analysis. [SEP] [CLS] He introduced the concept of Pareto efficiency and helped develop the field of microeconomics. [SEP] [CLS] He was also the first to discover that income follows a Pareto distribution, which is a power law probability distribution. [SEP] [CLS] The Pareto principle was named after him, and it was built on observations of his such as that 80% of the wealth in Italy belonged to about 20% of the population. [SEP] [CLS] He also contributed to the fields of sociology and mathematics, according to the mathematician Benoit Mandelbrot and Richard L. [SEP] [CLS] Hudson: His legacy as an economist was profound. [SEP] [CLS] Partly because of him, the field evolved from a branch of moral philosophy as practised by Adam Smith into a data intensive field of scientific research and mathematical equations. [SEP] [CLS] His books look more like modern economics than most other texts of that day: tables of statistics from across the world and ages, rows of integral signs and equations, intricate charts and graphs.
