[CLS] On 17 February 1978, a British Army Gazelle helicopter, serial number XX404, went down near Jonesborough, County Armagh, Northern Ireland, after being fired at by a Provisional IRA unit from the South Armagh Brigade. [SEP] [CLS] The IRA unit was involved at the time in a gun battle with a Green Jackets observation post deployed in the area, and the helicopter was sent in to support the ground troops. [SEP] [CLS] The helicopter crashed after the pilot lost control of the aircraft whilst evading ground fire. [SEP] [CLS] Lieutenant-Colonel Ian Douglas Corden-Lloyd, 2nd Battalion Green Jackets commanding officer, died in the crash. [SEP] [CLS] The incident was overshadowed by the La Mon restaurant bombing, which took place just hours later near Belfast. [SEP] [CLS]
