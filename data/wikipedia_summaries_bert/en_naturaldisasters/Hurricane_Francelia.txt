[CLS] Hurricane Francelia was the deadliest hurricane of the 1969 Atlantic hurricane season after causing significant flooding to Central America, especially Belize and Guatemala. [SEP] [CLS] The sixth named storm and fourth hurricane of the season, Francelia developed from a tropical wave in the southeastern Caribbean Sea on August 29. [SEP] [CLS] It moved west-northwestward and strengthened into a tropical storm on the following day. [SEP] [CLS] On September 1, Francelia reached hurricane status, shortly before re-curving west-southwest. [SEP] [CLS] While approaching Central America, the storm intensified and peaked as a 115 mph (185 km/h) Category 3 hurricane on September 2. [SEP] [CLS] Francelia weakened slightly before making landfall near Punta Gorda, Belize (then British Honduras) late on September 3. [SEP] [CLS] The storm quickly weakened inland and dissipated by the following day. [SEP] [CLS] During its early stages, Francelia brought gusty winds and light rainfall to several islands in the Caribbean Sea. [SEP] [CLS] While remaining nearly stationary offshore Central America, heavy precipitation fell in some countries, especially Guatemala where severe flooding killed 269 people and caused $15 million in damage. [SEP] [CLS] In neighboring Honduras, the hurricane struck after the undeclared Football War, causing additional damage in the northern portions of the country. [SEP] [CLS] Damage in Honduras was heaviest on the offshore Bay Islands, and the hurricane damaged or destroyed the majority of two towns there. [SEP] [CLS] In El Salvador, flooding isolated towns for several days and caused crop damage. [SEP] [CLS] Several rivers in the region flooded, with the Belize River reaching 36 feet (11 m) above normal. [SEP] [CLS] Coastal areas of Belize lost electricity and telephone service, and high winds resulted in extensive damage to banana crops. [SEP] [CLS] Francelia ranked as the deadliest tropical cyclone in Guatemala, until Hurricane Mitch in 1998. [SEP] [CLS] Overall damage was estimated at $35.6 million, and there were 271 deaths.
