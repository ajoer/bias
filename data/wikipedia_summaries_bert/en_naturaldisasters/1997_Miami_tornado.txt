The 1997 Miami Tornado (also known as the Great Miami Tornado) was an F1 tornado which touched down in Miami, Florida on May 12, 1997. [CLS] [SEP] It is remembered, not for its minor damage, but for its haunting pictures (which made headlines around the world.) The tornado formed in the afternoon (around 2:00 PM), initially touching down in the Silver Bluff Estates area. [CLS] [SEP] It then swept through Downtown, bypassing the city's skyscrapers. [CLS] [SEP] It then crossed the MacArthur Causeway and the Venetian Causeway, towards Miami Beach, sideswiping a cruise ship. [CLS] [SEP] It lifted from the water halfway through Biscayne Bay and touched down briefly again in Miami Beach, flipping over a car and then dissipating. [CLS] [SEP] The Storm Prediction Center in Oklahoma had noted the possibility for tornadoes in the area and warned that there might be more to come. [CLS] [SEP] While hurricanes are often seen as the biggest weather threat to Miami, tornadoes are relatively common in South Florida, although the vast majority of the ones that strike Miami-Dade County are small, relatively weak F0 or F1 tornadoes. [CLS] [SEP] Most of these tornadoes form as either waterspouts off Biscayne Bay, as part of the frequent afternoon thunderstorms, or spawned from a tropical storm or hurricane. [CLS] [SEP] Tornadoes can and have occurred in every month of the year in Miami-Dade County. [CLS] [SEP]
