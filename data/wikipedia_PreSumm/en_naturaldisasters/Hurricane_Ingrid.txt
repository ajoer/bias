[CLS] Hurricane Ingrid was one of two tropical cyclones, along with Hurricane Manuel, to strike Mexico within a 24â€‘hour period, the first such occurrence since 1958. [SEP] [CLS] Ingrid was the ninth named storm and second hurricane of the 2013 Atlantic hurricane season. [SEP] [CLS] It formed on September 12 in the Gulf of Mexico from a broad disturbance that also spawned Manuel in the eastern Pacific. [SEP] [CLS] After initially moving westward toward Veracruz, Ingrid turned northeastward away from the coast. [SEP] [CLS] Favorable conditions allowed it to attain hurricane status on September 14, and the next day Ingrid attained peak winds of 140 km/h (85 mph). [SEP] [CLS] Subsequently, increased wind shear weakened the convection as the storm turned more to the northwest and west. [SEP] [CLS] On September 16, Ingrid made landfall just south of La Pesca, Tamaulipas in northeastern Mexico as a strong tropical storm, and dissipated the next day. [SEP] [CLS] The hurricane was also the last one to form in the Gulf of Mexico until Hurricane Hermine in 2016. [SEP] [CLS] The combined impacts of hurricanes Ingrid and Manuel affected two-thirds of Mexico, killing 192 people and causing MXN$75 billion, or roughly US$5.7 billion in damage. [SEP] [CLS] Most of the effects were due to Manuel, though Ingrid was directly responsible for at least 32 deaths and $20 billion (MXN, US$1.5 billion) in damage. [SEP] [CLS] The two storms precipitated 162 billion m3 (162 km3; 5.7 trillion cu ft; 39 cu mi) of water, the equivalent of filling every dam in Mexico. [SEP] [CLS] Rainfall from the storm peaked at 511 mm (20.1 in) in Tuxpan, Veracruz. [SEP] [CLS] The rains caused widespread flooding, damaging at least 14,000 houses and hundreds of roads and bridges. [SEP] [CLS] In Tamaulipas, where the storm made landfall, the rainfall damaged crops and flooded rivers. [SEP] [CLS] The effects of the storm spread into South Texas, causing high tides and some flooding. [SEP] [CLS] After the storm, the Mexican government declared several municipalities to be in states of emergency. [SEP] [CLS] Relief agencies distributed food and aid to the hardest hit areas, although in Tamaulipas, residents had to rely on assistance from the local Gulf Cartel. [SEP] [CLS] The names Ingrid and Manuel were both later retired due to their impacts. [SEP] [CLS]
