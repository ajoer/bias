Typhoon Yancy, known in the Philippines as Typhoon Tasing, was one of the costliest and most intense tropical cyclones to strike Japan on record. [CLS] [SEP] Yancy was the sixth typhoon of the annual typhoon season and sixth tropical cyclone overall to impact Japan that year. [CLS] [SEP] Developing out of an area of disturbed weather in the open northwest Pacific on August 29, 1993, the precursor to Yancy tracked westward and quickly intensified to reach tropical storm strength on August 30. [CLS] [SEP] Just two days later, the tropical storm reached typhoon intensity as it recurved towards the northeast. [CLS] [SEP] A period of rapid intensification followed, allowing Yancy to quickly reach super typhoon intensity. [CLS] [SEP] The strong tropical cyclone reached peak intensity on September 2 with maximum sustained winds of 175 km/h (110 mph). [CLS] [SEP] The following day Yancy made its first landfall on I≈çjima at nearly the same strength; over the course of the day the typhoon would make three subsequent landfalls on Japanese islands. [CLS] [SEP] Land interaction forced the tropical cyclone to weaken, and after its final landfall on Hiroshima Prefecture, Yancy weakened below typhoon intensity. [CLS] [SEP] After emerging into the Sea of Japan, Yancy transitioned into an extratropical cyclone; these remnants persisted as they meandered in the sea before dissipating completely on September 7.
