Nebsemi was an ancient Egyptian queen consort, a wife of Pharaoh Thutmose III of the 18th Dynasty.A fragment of a granite statue of hers was found in Thutmose's Theban mortuary temple. [CLS] [SEP] It is about 80 cm high and 30 cm wide, and portrays the queen in a sitting position. [CLS] [SEP] Its style is reminiscent of 12th Dynasty statues, but since nothing else of that period was found in the temple, it was dated to the 18th dynasty. [CLS] [SEP] Nebsemi's name is not known from other sources, but judging from the statue's size she was an important person during the time when the temple was built. [CLS] [SEP] Her name is followed by the epithet maa kheru, "true of voice", indicating that she was already dead when the statue was made.Her titles were: "King's Wife" (ḥmt-nỉswt), "King's Beloved Wife" (ḥmt-nỉswt mrỉỉ.t=f ).
