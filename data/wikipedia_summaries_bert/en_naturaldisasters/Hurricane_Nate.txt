Hurricane Nate was the costliest natural disaster in Costa Rican history. [CLS] [SEP] An unusually fast-moving tropical cyclone, it caused severe flooding in Central America, leading to widespread destruction and casualties, during early October 2017, before making landfall on the US Gulf Coast. [CLS] [SEP] The fourteenth named storm and ninth hurricane of the hyperactive 2017 Atlantic hurricane season, Nate originated from a broad area of low pressure over the southwestern Caribbean on October 3. [CLS] [SEP] The disturbance moved northwest, organizing into a tropical depression the next day and attaining tropical storm intensity early on October 5. [CLS] [SEP] The storm moved ashore the coastline of Nicaragua thereafter. [CLS] [SEP] Little change in strength occurred as the system continued into Honduras, and Nate began steady intensification over the warm waters of the northwestern Caribbean Sea shortly thereafter. [CLS] [SEP] It attained hurricane strength while moving through the Yucat√°n Channel early on October 7, attaining peak winds of 90 mph (150 km/h) in the central Gulf of Mexico later that day. [CLS] [SEP] Early on the next day, Nate made landfall near the mouth of the Mississippi River in Louisiana. [CLS] [SEP] After crossing the marshland of the Mississippi Delta, it made its second U.S. [CLS] [SEP] landfall near Biloxi, Mississippi early on October 8, causing a storm surge to flood the ground floor of coastal casinos and buildings, as well as causing rip currents, hurricane-force winds, and beach erosion. [CLS] [SEP] Moving northwestward at 29 mph (47 km/h), Nate was the fastest-moving tropical system ever recorded in the Gulf of Mexico. [CLS] [SEP] It is also the fourth Atlantic hurricane of 2017 to have made landfall in the United States or one of its territories; such a quartet of landfalls has not occurred since 2005. [CLS] [SEP] In addition, Nate was the first tropical cyclone to move ashore in the state of Mississippi since Hurricane Katrina.A total of 48 deaths were attributed to Nate: 16 deaths were counted in Nicaragua, 14 in Costa Rica, 5 in Guatemala, 7 in Panama, 3 in Honduras, 1 in El Salvador, and 2 in the United States.
