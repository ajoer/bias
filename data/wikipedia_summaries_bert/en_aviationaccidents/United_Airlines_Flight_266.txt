[CLS] [SEP] On January 18, 1969 at approximately 18:21 PST it crashed into Santa Monica Bay, Pacific Ocean, about 11.5 miles west of Los Angeles International Airport, four minutes after takeoff. [CLS] [SEP] Rescuers (at the time) speculated that an explosion occurred aboard the plane, a Boeing 727. [CLS] [SEP] Three and a half hours after the crash three bodies had been found in the ocean along with parts of fuselage and a United States mail bag carrying letters with that day's postmark. [CLS] [SEP] Hope was dim for survivors because the aircraft was configured for domestic flights and did not carry liferafts or lifejackets. [CLS] [SEP] A Coast Guard spokesman said it looked "very doubtful that there could be anybody alive."Up until 2013, United used "Flight 266" designation on its San Francisco-Chicago (O'Hare) route.
