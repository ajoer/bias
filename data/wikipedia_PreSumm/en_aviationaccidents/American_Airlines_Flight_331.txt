[CLS] On 22 December 2009, an American Airlines Boeing 737-800, operating American Airlines Flight 331 (Washington, D.C.–Miami–Kingston, Jamaica) and carrying 148 passengers and six crew, overran runway 12 on landing at Kingston in poor weather. [SEP] [CLS] The plane continued on the ground outside the airport perimeter and broke apart on the beach, causing injuries. [SEP] [CLS] Factors contributing to the crash include the speed of the aircraft upon landing and the plane touching down more than 4,000 feet from the start of the runway. [SEP] [CLS] Contributing factors included American Airlines' failure to provide training on tailwind landings, and the FAA's failure to implement the NTSB's previous recommendation, following a previous fatal accident involving a tailwind landing attempt, that the FAA require commercial operators to train flight crews on tailwind landings.
