[CLS] Hurricane Erika was a weak hurricane that struck extreme northeastern Mexico near the Texas-Tamaulipas border in mid-August of the 2003 Atlantic hurricane season. [SEP] [CLS] Erika was the eighth tropical cyclone, fifth tropical storm, and third hurricane of the season. [SEP] [CLS] At first, the National Hurricane Center (NHC) operationally did not designate it as a hurricane because initial data suggested winds of 70 mph (115 km/h) at Erika's peak intensity. [SEP] [CLS] It was not until later data was analyzed that the NHC revised it to Category 1 intensity in the Saffir-Simpson Hurricane Scale. [SEP] [CLS] The storm developed from a non-tropical area of low pressure that was tracked for five days before developing in the eastern Gulf of Mexico on August 14. [SEP] [CLS] Under the influence of a high pressure system, Erika moved quickly westward and strengthened under favorable conditions. [SEP] [CLS] It made landfall as a hurricane on northeastern Mexico on August 16 and rapidly dissipated inland. [SEP] [CLS] While Erika's precursor disturbance was moving across Florida, it dropped heavy rainfall. [SEP] [CLS] In south Texas, Erika produced moderate winds of 50 to 60 mph (80 to 95 km/h) along with light rain, causing minor and isolated wind damage in the state. [SEP] [CLS] In northeastern Mexico, Erika produced moderate amounts of rainfall, resulting in mudslides and flooding. [SEP] [CLS] There, two people were killed when their vehicle was swept away by floodwaters. [SEP] [CLS]
