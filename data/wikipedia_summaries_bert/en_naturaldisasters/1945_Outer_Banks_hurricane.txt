The 1945 Outer Banks hurricane was a moderate hurricane that struck Florida and affected the East Coast of the United States in late June, 1945. [CLS] [SEP] The first tropical storm and the first hurricane of the Atlantic season, it developed on June 20 in the western Caribbean Sea off Honduras. [CLS] [SEP] For the next two days, it moved generally northward into the Gulf of Mexico. [CLS] [SEP] Reaching hurricane intensity on June 23, it then turned northeast toward the Florida peninsula. [CLS] [SEP] It made landfall in the Big Bend on June 24, then weakened to a tropical storm over land. [CLS] [SEP] Minor damage was reported in Florida, but the storm produced heavy, though beneficial, rains that eased one of the state's worst recorded droughts. [CLS] [SEP] Upon entering the Atlantic Ocean, it re-intensified into a hurricane and paralleled the East Coast. [CLS] [SEP] On June 26, it struck the Outer Banks of North Carolina as a minimal hurricane, producing minor damage but heavy rainfall. [CLS] [SEP] Continuing northeast, the cyclone delivered gale-force winds to New York and southern New England, causing traffic accidents and minor wind damage. [CLS] [SEP] Heavy rains drenched the area, and high waves offshore caused ships to need rescue. [CLS] [SEP] One man died in a traffic accident; some people were rescued on Long Island Sound. [CLS] [SEP] Peak winds on land were 66 miles per hour (106 km/h) at Nantucket, forcing ships to remain in port. [CLS] [SEP] The U.S. [CLS] [SEP] Coast Guard sought to escort ships at sea into safe harbor. [CLS] [SEP] Overall, the impact of the storm was minor, though temperatures fell almost 20 Â°F the day after the storm. [CLS] [SEP]
