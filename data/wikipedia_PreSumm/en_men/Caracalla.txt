[CLS] Caracalla ( KARR-ə-KAL-ə; 4 April 188 – 8 April 217), formally known as Antoninus (Marcus Aurelius Antoninus), was Roman emperor from 198 to 217. [SEP] [CLS] He was a member of the Severan dynasty, the elder son of Septimius Severus and Julia Domna. [SEP] [CLS] Co-ruler with his father from 198, he continued to rule with his brother Geta, emperor from 209, after their father's death in 211. [SEP] [CLS] His brother was murdered by the Praetorian Guard later that year, supposedly under orders from Caracalla himself, who then reigned afterwards as sole ruler of the Roman Empire. [SEP] [CLS] Caracalla's reign featured domestic instability and external invasions by the Germanic peoples. [SEP] [CLS] Caracalla's reign became notable for the Antonine Constitution (Latin: Constitutio Antoniniana), also known as the Edict of Caracalla, which granted Roman citizenship to all free men throughout the Roman Empire. [SEP] [CLS] The edict gave all the enfranchised men Caracalla's adopted praenomen and nomen: "Marcus Aurelius". [SEP] [CLS] Domestically, Caracalla became known for the construction of the Baths of Caracalla, which became the second-largest baths in Rome; for the introduction of a new Roman currency named the antoninianus, a sort of double denarius; and for the massacres he enacted against the people of Rome and elsewhere in the empire. [SEP] [CLS] In 216, Caracalla began a campaign against the Parthian Empire. [SEP] [CLS] He did not see this campaign through to completion due to his assassination by a disaffected soldier in 217. [SEP] [CLS] Macrinus succeeded him as emperor three days later. [SEP] [CLS] The ancient sources portray Caracalla as a tyrant and as a cruel leader, an image that has survived into modernity. [SEP] [CLS] Dio Cassius (c. [SEP] [CLS] 155 – c. [SEP] [CLS] 235) and Herodian (c. [SEP] [CLS] 170 – c. [SEP] [CLS] 240) present Caracalla as a soldier first and an emperor second. [SEP] [CLS] In the 12th century, Geoffrey of Monmouth started the legend of Caracalla's role as the king of Britain. [SEP] [CLS] Later, in the 18th century, the works of French painters revived images of Caracalla due to apparent parallels between Caracalla's tyranny and that ascribed to Louis XVI of France (r. [SEP] [CLS] 1774–1792). [SEP] [CLS] Modern works continue to portray Caracalla as an evil ruler, painting him as one of the most tyrannical of all Roman emperors. [SEP] [CLS]
