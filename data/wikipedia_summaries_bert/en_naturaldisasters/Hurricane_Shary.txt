Hurricane Shary was a short-lived tropical cyclone that stayed over the open waters of the North Atlantic in late October 2010. [CLS] [SEP] The eighteenth named storm and eleventh hurricane of the unusually active 2010 Atlantic hurricane season, Shary originated from a weak area of convection over the Central Atlantic and became a tropical storm on October 28. [CLS] [SEP] Initially not expected to exceed wind speeds of 50 mph (85 km/h), Shary defied predictions and became a minimal hurricane on October 30, passing well east of Bermuda. [CLS] [SEP] Unfavorable conditions subsequently impacted the storm, and Shary quickly began to lose tropical characteristics. [CLS] [SEP] Later that day, Shary degenerated into a post-tropical cyclone, and the final advisory by the National Hurricane Center was issued. [CLS] [SEP] The storm brushed Bermuda with light rain, and wind gusts reached no more than 35 mph (55 km/h) as it made its closest point of approach to the territory. [CLS] [SEP]
