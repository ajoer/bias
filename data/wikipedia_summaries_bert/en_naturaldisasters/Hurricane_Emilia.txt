Hurricane Emilia was, at the time, the strongest tropical cyclone on record in the Central Pacific Ocean, and the second of such to be classified as a Category 5 hurricane – the highest rating on the Saffir–Simpson hurricane wind scale. [CLS] [SEP] However, hurricanes Gilma later that year, Ioke in 2006, and hurricanes Lane and Walaka in 2018 later reached lower barometric pressures in the Central Pacific. [CLS] [SEP] The fifth named storm and the first of three Category 5 hurricanes of the 1994 hurricane season, Emilia developed from an area of low pressure southeast of Hawaii on July 16. [CLS] [SEP] Tracking westward, the initial tropical depression intensified into a tropical storm several hours after tropical cyclogenesis. [CLS] [SEP] Subsequently, Emilia entered the Central Pacific Ocean and moved into the area of responsibility of the Central Pacific Hurricane Center (CPHC). [CLS] [SEP] After reaching hurricane intensity the following day, the tropical cyclone began to rapidly intensify, and late on July 19, Emilia reached its record peak intensity with maximum sustained winds of 160 mph (260 km/h) and a minimum barometric pressure of 926 mbar (hPa; 27.34 inHg), rating it as a Category 5 hurricane. [CLS] [SEP] After slight oscillations in strength, an upper-level trough forced the intense hurricane northwest on July 21, and Emilia began to weaken thereafter. [CLS] [SEP] The tropical cyclone encountered an area of vertical wind shear and cool sea surface temperatures, which further weakened the system. [CLS] [SEP] The following day, Emilia made its closest approach to the Big Island of Hawaii, but subsequently weakened to below hurricane intensity. [CLS] [SEP] This weakening trend continued, and the tropical cyclone fully dissipated on July 25. [CLS] [SEP] Though the hurricane did not make landfall, Emilia brought strong surf to the islands of Hawaii and caused gusty winds, which resulted in some property damage. [CLS] [SEP] Precipitation was also reported, but remained under moderate levels. [CLS] [SEP]
