Typhoon Janis, known in the Philippines as Typhoon Gloring, was an early-season typhoon that struck Japan during August 1992. [CLS] [SEP] An area of disturbed weather formed near Pohnpei in late-July 1992, and after an increase in thunderstorm activity, a tropical depression developed on August 3. [CLS] [SEP] After passing near Guam, Janis tracked generally westward, and on August 5, the storm was believed to have attained typhoon intensity. [CLS] [SEP] After intensifying at a brisk pace, Janis attained peak intensity on August 6 near Okinawa. [CLS] [SEP] Thereafter, the typhoon began to weaken and accelerate as it recurved towards Kyushu, where it made landfall on the next day. [CLS] [SEP] Land interaction took its toll on the typhoon as it tracked northeast, paralleling the western coast of Honshu. [CLS] [SEP] On August 9, Janis transitioned into an extratropical low over Hokkaido. [CLS] [SEP] Five fishing boats sank offshore Taiwan, where one fisherman was killed, and six others were listed missing. [CLS] [SEP] Typhoon Janis was the second of two consecutive systems to move over the Japanese archipelago, with Tropical Storm Irving proceeding it. [CLS] [SEP] Nationwide, twelve fatalities were reported and another was initially reported as missing. [CLS] [SEP] Sixty-seven others sustained injuries. [CLS] [SEP] A total 1,561 houses were destroyed while 1,508 others were flooded. [CLS] [SEP] In addition, 47 ships and 4,802 ha (11,870 acres) were damaged. [CLS] [SEP] Strong winds and torrential rains resulted in 350,000 customers losing power. [CLS] [SEP] An eight-hour suspension of high speed rail to Kyushu stranded over 20,000 people at Hiroshima Station. [CLS] [SEP] Greater than 80 domestic flights in Kyushu were cancelled, leaving an estimated 45,000 travelers stranded. [CLS] [SEP] Damage was estimated at Â¥74 billion ($584 million USD).
