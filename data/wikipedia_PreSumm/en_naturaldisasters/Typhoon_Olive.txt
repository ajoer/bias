[CLS] The 1960 Pacific typhoon season had no official bounds; it ran year-round in 1960, but most tropical cyclones tend to form in the northwestern Pacific Ocean between June and December. [SEP] [CLS] These dates conventionally delimit the period of each year when most tropical cyclones form in the northwestern Pacific Ocean. [SEP] [CLS] The scope of this article is limited to the Pacific Ocean, north of the equator and west of the international date line. [SEP] [CLS] Storms that form east of the date line and north of the equator are called hurricanes; see 1960 Pacific hurricane season. [SEP] [CLS] Tropical storms formed in the entire west Pacific basin were assigned a name by the Joint Typhoon Warning Center.
