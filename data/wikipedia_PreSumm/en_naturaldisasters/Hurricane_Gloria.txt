[CLS] Hurricane Gloria was the first significant tropical cyclone to strike the northeastern United States since Hurricane Agnes in 1972 and the first major storm to affect New York City and Long Island directly since Hurricane Donna in 1960. [SEP] [CLS] It was a powerful Cape Verde hurricane that formed during the 1985 Atlantic hurricane season, originating from a tropical wave on September 16 in the eastern Atlantic Ocean. [SEP] [CLS] After remaining a weak tropical cyclone for several days, Gloria intensified into a hurricane on September 22 north of the Lesser Antilles. [SEP] [CLS] During that time, the storm had moved generally westward, although it turned to the northwest due to a weakening of the ridge. [SEP] [CLS] Gloria quickly intensified on September 24, and the next day reached peak winds of 145 mph (230 km/h). [SEP] [CLS] The hurricane weakened before striking the Outer Banks of North Carolina on September 27. [SEP] [CLS] Later that day, Gloria made two subsequent landfalls on Long Island and across the coastline of western Connecticut, before becoming extratropical on September 28 over New England. [SEP] [CLS] The remnants moved through Atlantic Canada, eventually dissipating on October 2. [SEP] [CLS] Before Gloria made landfall, the National Hurricane Center issued hurricane warnings at some point for the East Coast of the United States from South Carolina to Maine. [SEP] [CLS] Hundreds of thousands of people evacuated, and the hurricane was described as the "storm of the century". [SEP] [CLS] In general, Gloria's strongest winds remained east of the center, which largely spared locations from North Carolina to New Jersey, and the passage at low tide reduced storm surge. [SEP] [CLS] Hurricane-force winds and gusts affected much of the path, which knocked down trees and power lines. [SEP] [CLS] This left over 4 million people without power, including the worst power outage in Connecticut history related to a natural disaster. [SEP] [CLS] The extended power outage on Long Island, affecting 1.5 million people at some point, caused the Long Island Lighting Company to be shut down and be replaced with a public company. [SEP] [CLS] Fallen trees caused six of the storm's fourteen deaths. [SEP] [CLS] In North Carolina, high waves damaged many homes along the Outer Banks and caused heavy beach erosion. [SEP] [CLS] High waves also damaged piers, boats, and docks throughout the Mid-Atlantic states. [SEP] [CLS] Flooding forced several highways to close, and in Pennsylvania, thousands were forced to evacuate their homes. [SEP] [CLS] The storm surge destroyed 48 homes on Long Island, while the winds damaged the roofs of many more. [SEP] [CLS] Widespread crop damage occurred, amounting to about $20 million (1985 USD). [SEP] [CLS] Overall damage in the United States was estimated at $900 million, which was less than expected. [SEP] [CLS] In neighboring Canada, the remnants of Gloria caused minor power outages in New Brunswick, although confusion related to the storm's arrival led to the creation of the Canadian Hurricane Centre.
