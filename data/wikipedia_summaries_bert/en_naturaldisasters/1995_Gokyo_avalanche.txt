The 1995 India cyclone was a tropical cyclone that struck southeastern India which later spawned a rare snowstorm in Nepal, triggering the deadliest mountain trekking incident in the country's history in November 1995. [CLS] [SEP] The storm originated from the monsoon trough on November 7 in the Bay of Bengal, east of India, becoming the penultimate storm of the 1995 North Indian Ocean cyclone season. [CLS] [SEP] Moving northwestward, the system gradually intensified while moving toward land, eventually developing an eye in the middle of the convection. [CLS] [SEP] Reaching peak winds of at least 120 km/h (75 mph), the India Meteorological Department (IMD) classified the system as a very severe cyclonic storm on November 8, in line with intensity estimates from the American-based Joint Typhoon Warning Center (JTWC). [CLS] [SEP] On November 9, the cyclone made landfall near the border of Andhra Pradesh and Orissa. [CLS] [SEP] A typical for most November storms, the system continued to the north and dissipated over Nepal on November 11. [CLS] [SEP] In India, the cyclone's strong winds were accompanied by heavy rainfall and a storm surge of 1.5 m (4.9 ft) that inundated the coastline several hundred feet inland. [CLS] [SEP] Power lines, crops, and houses were damaged, and many boats were damaged, causing several nautical fatalities. [CLS] [SEP] The cyclone killed at least 128 people in India, with hundreds remaining unaccounted for, and damage was estimated at RS$1.1 billion (US$ 32.2 million). [CLS] [SEP] In neighboring Bangladesh, high waves killed 45 people after sinking or sweeping away four ships. [CLS] [SEP] The cyclone later spawned a rare November snowstorm across eastern Nepal, with depths reaching 2,000 mm (79 in). [CLS] [SEP] The snowfall occurred without warning amid the busy mountain trekking season, and there were several avalanches and landslides across the country. [CLS] [SEP] One such incident killed 24 people at a lodge near Gokyo, and there were 63 deaths related to the cyclone in the country. [CLS] [SEP] The Nepal government launched the largest search and rescue mission in the country's history, rescuing 450 people, some of whom trapped for days in the snow. [CLS] [SEP]
