[CLS] Hurricane Klaus was a minimal Atlantic hurricane that dropped heavy rainfall across the Lesser Antilles in October 1990. [SEP] [CLS] The eleventh tropical cyclone and sixth hurricane of the 1990 Atlantic hurricane season, Klaus developed from a tropical wave on October 3 a short distance east of Dominica. [SEP] [CLS] It drifted northwestward, and quickly intensified to attain hurricane status on October 5. [SEP] [CLS] Though its closest approach to the Lesser Antilles was within 12 miles (19 km), the strongest winds remained to its northeast due to strong wind shear, which caused Klaus to steadily weaken. [SEP] [CLS] After deteriorating into a tropical depression, Klaus briefly restrengthened over the Bahamas before dissipating on October 9 under the influence of developing tropical storm, Marco. [SEP] [CLS] Heavy rainfall on Saint Lucia destroyed about 15% of its yearly banana crop. [SEP] [CLS] Damage was heaviest on Martinique, where seven casualties occurred and 1,500 people were left homeless as the heavy rainfall caused severe flooding on the island, resulting in some landslides. [SEP] [CLS] The remnant moisture of Klaus entered the southeastern United States, dropping heavy rainfall and causing four casualties; the same area was affected with more precipitation a few days later by Tropical Storm Marco. [SEP] [CLS] Due to the damage caused by the storm, the name Klaus was retired from the list of tropical cyclone names. [SEP] [CLS]
