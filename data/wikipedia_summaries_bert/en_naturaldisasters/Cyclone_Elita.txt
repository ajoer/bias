[CLS] Cyclone Elita was an unusual tropical cyclone that made landfall on Madagascar three times. [SEP] [CLS] The fifth named storm of the 2003–04 South-West Indian Ocean cyclone season, Elita developed in the Mozambique Channel on January 24, 2004. [SEP] [CLS] It strengthened to tropical cyclone status before striking northwestern Madagascar on January 28; it was the first storm to strike western Madagascar at that intensity since Cyclone Cynthia in 1991. [SEP] [CLS] Elita weakened to tropical depression status while crossing the island, and after exiting into the southwest Indian Ocean, it turned to the west and moved ashore in eastern Madagascar on January 31. [SEP] [CLS] After once again crossing the island, the cyclone reached the Mozambique Channel and re-intensified. [SEP] [CLS] Elita turned to the southeast to make its final landfall on February 3 along southwestern Madagascar. [SEP] [CLS] Two days later, it underwent an extratropical transition; subsequently, the remnant system moved erratically before dissipating on February 13. [SEP] [CLS] Elita dropped heavy rainfall of more than 200 mm (8 inches), which damaged or destroyed thousands of houses in Madagascar. [SEP] [CLS] Over 50,000 people were left homeless, primarily in Mahajanga and Toliara provinces. [SEP] [CLS] Flooding from the storm ruined more than 450 km² (170 sq mi) of agricultural land, including important crops for food. [SEP] [CLS] Across the island, the cyclone caused 33 deaths, with its impact further compounded by Cyclone Gafilo about two months later. [SEP] [CLS] Elsewhere, Elita brought rainfall and damage to Mozambique and Malawi, and its outer wind circulation produced rough seas and strong gusts in Seychelles, Mauritius, and Réunion.
