[CLS] The September 2009 Vietnam tropical depression was a weak tropical depression that caused deadly flooding throughout central Vietnam in early September. [SEP] [CLS] Forming out of an area of low pressure on September 3, the depression hardly intensified as it meandered off the coast of Vietnam. [SEP] [CLS] Initially situated in a favorable environment, convective banding features began to develop and shower and thunderstorm activity formed near the center. [SEP] [CLS] On September 4, the Joint Typhoon Warning Center issued a Tropical Cyclone Formation Alert; however, a sudden increase in wind shear caused the system to rapidly become disorganized, leading to the cancellation of the alert the next day. [SEP] [CLS] The system continued to slowly track off the coast of Vietnam, nearly dissipating on September 5, before becoming better organized. [SEP] [CLS] However, the depression remained weak, with the JTWC reporting on September 7 that the depression had dissipated, though the Japan Meteorological Agency (JMA) continued to issue advisories until the depression dissipated during September 9. [SEP] [CLS] Although the depression did not make landfall, the outer rainbands of the storm led to heavy rainfall throughout central Vietnam, peaking at 430 mm (17 in). [SEP] [CLS] The ensuing floods killed at least six people and left three others missing. [SEP] [CLS] Large areas of cropland were inundated by the waters and numerous homes were damaged. [SEP] [CLS] In Quáº£ng Nam Province, damages from the system were estimated at 45 billion (VND; $2.52 million USD). [SEP] [CLS]
