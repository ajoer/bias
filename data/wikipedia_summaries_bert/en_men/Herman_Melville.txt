Herman Melville (born Melvill; August 1, 1819 â€“ September 28, 1891) was an American novelist, short story writer, and poet of the American Renaissance period. [CLS] [SEP] Among his best-known works are Moby-Dick (1851), Typee (1846), a romanticized account of his experiences in Polynesia, and Billy Budd, Sailor, a posthumously published novella. [CLS] [SEP] Although his reputation was not high at the time of his death, the centennial of his birth in 1919 was the starting point of a Melville revival and Moby-Dick grew to be considered one of the great American novels. [CLS] [SEP] Melville was born in New York City, the third child of a prosperous merchant whose death in 1832 left the family in financial straits. [CLS] [SEP] He took to sea in 1839 as a common sailor on a merchant ship and then on the whaler Acushnet but he jumped ship in the Marquesas Islands. [CLS] [SEP] Typee, his first book, and its sequel, Omoo (1847), were travel-adventures based on his encounters with the peoples of the island. [CLS] [SEP] Their success gave him the financial security to marry Elizabeth Shaw, the daughter of a prominent Boston family. [CLS] [SEP] Mardi (1849), a romance-adventure and his first book not based on his own experience, was not well received. [CLS] [SEP] Redburn (1849) and White Jacket (1850), both tales based on his experience as a well-born young man at sea, were given respectable reviews but did not sell well enough to support his expanding family. [CLS] [SEP] Melville's growing literary ambition showed in Moby-Dick (1851), which took nearly a year and a half to write, but it did not find an audience and critics scorned his psychological novel Pierre: or, The Ambiguities (1852). [CLS] [SEP] From 1853 to 1856, Melville published short fiction in magazines, including "Benito Cereno" and "Bartleby, the Scrivener". [CLS] [SEP] In 1857, he traveled to England, toured the Near East, and published his last work of prose, The Confidence-Man (1857). [CLS] [SEP] He moved to New York in 1863 to take a position as Customs Inspector. [CLS] [SEP] From that point, Melville focused his creative powers on poetry. [CLS] [SEP] Battle-Pieces and Aspects of the War (1866) was his poetic reflection on the moral questions of the American Civil War. [CLS] [SEP] In 1867, his eldest child Malcolm died at home from a self-inflicted gunshot. [CLS] [SEP] Melville's metaphysical epic Clarel: A Poem and Pilgrimage in the Holy Land was published in 1876. [CLS] [SEP] In 1886, his other son Stanwix died of apparent tuberculosis, and Melville retired. [CLS] [SEP] During his last years, he privately published two volumes of poetry, and left one volume unpublished. [CLS] [SEP] The novella Billy Budd was left unfinished at his death but was published posthumously in 1924. [CLS] [SEP] Melville died from cardiovascular disease in 1891. [CLS] [SEP]
