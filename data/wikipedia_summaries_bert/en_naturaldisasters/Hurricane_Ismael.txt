[CLS] Hurricane Ismael was a weak, but deadly Pacific hurricane that killed over one hundred people in northern Mexico in September of the 1995 Pacific hurricane season. [SEP] [CLS] It developed from a persistent area of deep convection on September 12, and steadily strengthened as it moved to the north-northwest. [SEP] [CLS] Ismael attained hurricane status on September 14 while located 210 miles (340 km) off the coast of Mexico. [SEP] [CLS] It continued to the north, and after passing a short distance east of Baja California it made landfall on Topolobampo in the state of Sinaloa with winds of 80 mph (130 km/h). [SEP] [CLS] Ismael rapidly weakened over land, and dissipated on September 16 over northwestern Mexico. [SEP] [CLS] The remnants entered the United States and extended eastward into the Mid-Atlantic States. [SEP] [CLS] Offshore, Ismael produced waves of up to 30 feet (9 m) in height. [SEP] [CLS] Hundreds of fishermen were unprepared for the hurricane, which was expected to move more slowly, and as a result 52 ships were wrecked, killing 57 fishermen. [SEP] [CLS] On land, Ismael caused 59 deaths in mainland Mexico and resulted in $26 million in damage (1995 USD, $43.6 million 2020 USD).
