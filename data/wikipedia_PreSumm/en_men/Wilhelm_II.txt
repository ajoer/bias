[CLS] Wilhelm II (Friedrich Wilhelm Viktor Albert; 27 January 1859 â€“ 4 June 1941), anglicised as William II, was the last German Emperor (Kaiser) and King of Prussia. [SEP] [CLS] He reigned from 15 June 1888 until his abdication on 9 November 1918 shortly before Germany's defeat in World War I. [SEP] [CLS] As the eldest grandchild of Queen Victoria, Wilhelm's first cousins included George V of the United Kingdom and many princesses who, along with Wilhelm's sister Sophia, became European consorts. [SEP] [CLS] For most of his life before becoming emperor, he was second in line to succeed his grandfather Wilhelm I on the German and Prussian thrones after his father, Frederick. [SEP] [CLS] His grandfather and father both died in 1888, the Year of Three Emperors, making Wilhelm emperor and king. [SEP] [CLS] He dismissed the country's longtime chancellor, Otto von Bismarck, in 1890. [SEP] [CLS] Wilhelm took control of foreign and military policy with a bellicose "New Course" to cement Germany's status as a respected world power. [SEP] [CLS] However, he frequently undermined this goal by making tactless, alarming public statements without seeking his ministers' advice. [SEP] [CLS] Additionally, his regime did much to alienate itself from the other Great Powers by initiating a massive naval build-up, and challenging French control of Morocco. [SEP] [CLS] His turbulent reign ultimately culminated in Germany's absolute guarantee of military support to Austria-Hungary during the crisis of July 1914, one of the key developments leading to the outbreak of World War I. [SEP] [CLS] A lax wartime leader, he left virtually all decision-making regarding military strategy and organisation of the war effort to the Great General Staff. [SEP] [CLS] This broad delegation of authority gave rise to a de facto military dictatorship whose belligerent foreign policy led to the United States' entry into the war on 6 April 1917. [SEP] [CLS] After losing the support of the German military and his subjects in November 1918, Wilhelm abdicated and fled to exile in the Netherlands. [SEP] [CLS] He remained there during the German occupation, and died in 1941. [SEP] [CLS]
