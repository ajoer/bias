[CLS] The November 2014 Bering Sea cyclone (also referred to as Post-Tropical Cyclone Nuri by the U.S. [SEP] [CLS] government) was the most intense extratropical cyclone (also a bomb cyclone) ever recorded in the Bering Sea, which formed from a new storm developing out of the low-level circulation that separated from Typhoon Nuri, which soon absorbed the latter. [SEP] [CLS] The cyclone brought gale-force winds to the western Aleutian Islands and produced even higher gusts in other locations, including a 97 miles per hour (156 km/h) gust in Shemya, Alaska. [SEP] [CLS] The storm coincidentally occurred three years after another historic extratropical cyclone impacted an area slightly further to the east. [SEP] [CLS]
