Severe Tropical Cyclone Raja was a tropical cyclone that holds the 24-hour rainfall record of 674.9 mm (26.57 in) for the French Overseas Territory of Wallis and Futuna. [CLS] [SEP] The system was first noted by the Fiji Meteorological Service (FMS) as a weak tropical disturbance northeast of Tokelau in mid-December 1986. [CLS] [SEP] The system developed further as it moved southwest over the next few days, and it was classified as Tropical Cyclone Raja on 23 December. [CLS] [SEP] The newly named system slowed and unexpectedly recurved southeast towards the French territory of Wallis and Futuna on 24 December. [CLS] [SEP] Over the next two days, Raja interacted with what would become Severe Tropical Cyclone Sally and executed a tight loop, passing within 55 km (35 mi) of Futuna. [CLS] [SEP] The system peaked as a Category 3 severe tropical cyclone on 28 December, with estimated 10-minute sustained winds of 150 km/h (90 mph). [CLS] [SEP] The storm turned southwest the next day and threatened Fiji, where it passed within 20 km (10 mi) of Vanua Levu and near (or over) several smaller islands in the Lau group during the following day. [CLS] [SEP] Raja gradually weakened over the next few days as it moved south of Fiji; it was last noted on 5 January 1987 after it filled up over the north Tasman Sea. [CLS] [SEP] Raja caused one death as it impacted the island nations of Tuvalu, Wallis and Futuna, Tonga and Fiji. [CLS] [SEP] Gusty winds and rough seas associated with the system caused extensive damage to crops, coastal installations and buildings in Tuvalu, and flooded low-lying areas. [CLS] [SEP] The island of Futuna was the worst hit, with crops, coastal installations and buildings damaged or destroyed by the system. [CLS] [SEP] Raja affected the main islands of Fiji twice between 24 and 30 December, and was responsible for the worst flood of the Labasa River since 1929. [CLS] [SEP] As a result of the damage to Fiji and portions of Polynesia, the name Raja was retired from the South Pacific naming lists. [CLS] [SEP]
