Sophocles (; Greek: Σοφοκλῆς Sophoklês, pronounced [so.pʰo.klɛ̂ːs]; c. [CLS] [SEP] 497/6 – winter 406/5 BC) is one of three ancient Greek tragedians whose plays have survived. [CLS] [SEP] His first plays were written later than or contemporary with those of Aeschylus, and earlier than or contemporary with those of Euripides. [CLS] [SEP] Sophocles wrote over 120 plays during the course of his life, but only seven have survived in a complete form: Ajax, Antigone, Women of Trachis, Oedipus Rex, Electra, Philoctetes and Oedipus at Colonus. [CLS] [SEP] For almost 50 years, Sophocles was the most celebrated playwright in the dramatic competitions of the city-state of Athens that took place during the religious festivals of the Lenaea and the Dionysia. [CLS] [SEP] He competed in 30 competitions, won 24, and was never judged lower than second place. [CLS] [SEP] Aeschylus won 13 competitions, and was sometimes defeated by Sophocles, while Euripides won four competitions.The most famous tragedies of Sophocles feature Oedipus and also Antigone: they are generally known as the Theban plays, although each play was actually a part of a different tetralogy, the other members of which are now lost. [CLS] [SEP] Sophocles influenced the development of drama, most importantly by adding a third actor, thereby reducing the importance of the chorus in the presentation of the plot. [CLS] [SEP] He also developed his characters to a greater extent than earlier playwrights such as Aeschylus. [CLS] [SEP]
