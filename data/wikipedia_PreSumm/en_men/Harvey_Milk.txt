[CLS] Harvey Bernard Milk (May 22, 1930 – November 27, 1978) was an American politician and the first openly gay elected official in the history of California, where he was elected to the San Francisco Board of Supervisors. [SEP] [CLS] Although he was the most pro-LGBT politician in the United States at the time, politics and activism were not his early interests; he was neither open about his sexuality nor civically active until he was 40, after his experiences in the counterculture movement of the 1960s. [SEP] [CLS] In 1972, Milk moved from New York City to the Castro District of San Francisco amid a migration of gay and bisexual men. [SEP] [CLS] He took advantage of the growing political and economic power of the neighborhood to promote his interests and unsuccessfully ran three times for political office. [SEP] [CLS] Milk's theatrical campaigns earned him increasing popularity, and in 1977 he won a seat as a city supervisor. [SEP] [CLS] His election was made possible by a key component of a shift in San Francisco politics. [SEP] [CLS] Milk served almost eleven months in office, during which he sponsored a bill banning discrimination in public accommodations, housing, and employment on the basis of sexual orientation. [SEP] [CLS] The Supervisors passed the bill by a vote of 11–1, and it was signed into law by Mayor George Moscone. [SEP] [CLS] On November 27, 1978, Milk and Moscone were assassinated by Dan White, a disgruntled city supervisor. [SEP] [CLS] Despite his short career in politics, Milk became an icon in San Francisco and a martyr in the gay community. [SEP] [CLS] In 2002, Milk was called "the most famous and most significantly open LGBT official ever elected in the United States". [SEP] [CLS] Anne Kronenberg, his final campaign manager, wrote of him: "What set Harvey apart from you or me was that he was a visionary. [SEP] [CLS] He imagined a righteous world inside his head and then he set about to create it for real, for all of us." Milk was posthumously awarded the Presidential Medal of Freedom in 2009.
