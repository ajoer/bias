Python of Byzantium (Greek: Πύθων ὁ Βυζάντιος) was an ancient Greek statesman and former student of Isocrates. [CLS] [SEP] In 346 BC, he appears to have participated in negotiations at Pella that resulted in the Peace of Philocrates. [CLS] [SEP] In 343 BC, Python represented Philip II of Macedon in Athens with an offer to alter the overall treaty. [CLS] [SEP] Hegesippus remarked that Python oratorically adhered to the instructions of his teachers in Athens (implying that Isocrates was a supporter of Macedon since he retained some influence over Python). [CLS] [SEP] Based on Demosthenes's Against Aristocrates, Python of Byzantium was identified with Python of Aenus the latter of which killed King Cotys I of the Odrysian Kingdom. [CLS] [SEP] However, it is highly unlikely that both names are attributed to one individual. [CLS] [SEP]
