Fanny Mendelssohn (14 November 1805 – 14 May 1847), later Fanny [Cäcilie] Mendelssohn Bartholdy and, after her marriage, Fanny Hensel, was a German composer and pianist from the Romantic era. [CLS] [SEP] She grew up in Berlin, Germany, and received a thorough musical education from teachers including her mother, Ludwig Berger, and Carl Friedrich Zelter. [CLS] [SEP] Her brother Felix Mendelssohn, also a composer and pianist, shared the same education and the two developed a close relationship. [CLS] [SEP] Due to the reservations of her family, and to social conventions of the time about the roles of women, a number of her works were published under her brother's name in his Opus 8 and 9 collections. [CLS] [SEP] In 1829, she married the artist Wilhelm Hensel and, in 1830, the two had their only child, Sebastian Hensel. [CLS] [SEP] In 1846, despite the continuing ambivalence of her family towards her musical ambitions, Fanny Hensel published a collection of songs as her Opus 1. [CLS] [SEP] The next year, she suddenly died of a stroke. [CLS] [SEP] She composed over 460 pieces of music, including a piano trio, a piano quartet, an orchestral overture, four cantatas, over 125 pieces for the piano, and over 250 lieder, most of which went unpublished in her lifetime. [CLS] [SEP] Since the 1990s her life and works have been the subject of more detailed research. [CLS] [SEP] Her Easter Sonata was inaccurately credited to her brother in 1970, before analysis of new documents in 2010 corrected the error. [CLS] [SEP] The Fanny & Felix Mendelssohn Museum opened on 29 May 2018 in Hamburg, Germany. [CLS] [SEP]
