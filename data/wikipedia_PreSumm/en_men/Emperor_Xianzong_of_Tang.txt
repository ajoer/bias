[SEP] [CLS] In 813, after the submission of one of the key holdouts, Weibo Circuit (魏博, headquartered in modern Handan, Hebei) under Tian Xing, Emperor Xianzong appeared poised to reunite the empire, many parts of which had effectively been ruled independently by regional warlords.

[SEP] [CLS] However, by 817, after the defeat of Li Shidao and Wang's submission, all of the empire was under imperial authority again. [SEP] [CLS] Later historians referred to Emperor Xianzong's reign as the Yuanhe Restoration (元和中興).Emperor Xianzong's reign briefly stabilized Tang from the destructive forces of the military governors, but saw the rise of the power of eunuchs.
