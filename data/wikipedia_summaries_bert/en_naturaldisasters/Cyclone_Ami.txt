Severe Tropical Cyclone Ami (RSMC Nadi designation: 05F, JTWC designation: 10P) was one of the worst cyclones to affect Fiji. [CLS] [SEP] The system was the third cyclone and the second severe tropical cyclone of the 2002â€“03 South Pacific cyclone season. [CLS] [SEP] Cyclone Ami developed from a low-pressure area east of Tuvalu on January 12. [CLS] [SEP] Originally, the storm moved slowly towards the southwest early in its existence. [CLS] [SEP] Influenced by an upper-level trough, Ami slowed and began moving towards the south and then southeast. [CLS] [SEP] The cyclone attained severe tropical cyclone intensity on January 13. [CLS] [SEP] Ami made its first landfall at Vanua Levu, before subsequently making another landfall on Taveuni. [CLS] [SEP] Still intensifying, Ami reached peak intensity as an equivalent Category 3 cyclone on the Australian and Fiji cyclone scales on January 14. [CLS] [SEP] Accelerating to the southeast, the cyclone began to cross over cool sea surface temperatures and encountered wind shear. [CLS] [SEP] Ami transitioned into an extratropical cyclone the day after. [CLS] [SEP] Cyclone Ami severely impacted areas of Fiji, primarily causing flooding. [CLS] [SEP] Numerous landslides and power outages resulted from the heavy rains. [CLS] [SEP] Damage was particularly severe in Labasa, Fiji, where floodwater inundated the entire city. [CLS] [SEP] Damage sustained to crops was also severe, especially the sugar cane, where production decreased by 15% due to Ami. [CLS] [SEP] In Tonga, damage was not as severe. [CLS] [SEP] However, two ships offshore were grounded due to the cyclone. [CLS] [SEP] Ami caused F$104.4 million (US$51.2 million) in damages and 17 deaths, primarily on Fiji. [CLS] [SEP] Following the deaths and damage, the name "Ami" was later retired. [CLS] [SEP]
