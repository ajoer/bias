The 2012–13 North American drought, an expansion of the 2010–13 Southern United States drought, originated in the midst of a record-breaking heat wave. [CLS] [SEP] Low snowfall amounts in winter, coupled with the intense summer heat from La Niña, caused drought-like conditions to migrate northward from the southern United States, wreaking havoc on crops and water supply. [CLS] [SEP] The drought inflicted significant economic ramifications for the affected states. [CLS] [SEP] It exceeded, in many measures, the 1988–89 North American drought, the most recent comparable drought.The drought affected most of the U.S., parts of Mexico, and central and Eastern Canada. [CLS] [SEP] At its peak in July 2012, it covered approximately 81 percent of the contiguous United States with at least abnormally dry (D0) conditions. [CLS] [SEP] Out of that 81%, 64% was designated as at least moderate drought (D1) conditions. [CLS] [SEP] Its area was comparable to the droughts in the 1930s and 1950s.Drought continued in parts of North America through 2013. [CLS] [SEP] Beginning in March 2013, improved rainfall across the Midwest, southern Mississippi Valley, and Great Plains began gradually alleviating drought in these areas, while drought continued to intensify in the Western United States. [CLS] [SEP] Heavy rains across previously drought-stricken areas resulted in widespread flooding in portions of the Midwest, a phenomenon which was named "weather whiplash". [CLS] [SEP] By June 2013, approximately the eastern half of the United States was drought-free, while conditions continued to gradually improve across the Plains. [CLS] [SEP] Moderate to severe drought continues to impact and worsen throughout the western United States, with some portions of the United States being afflicted by the drought for over three years. [CLS] [SEP] Through the winter of 2013–2014, California continued to receive record low rainfall. [CLS] [SEP] For many locations, the calendar year of 2013 was the driest year in over 130 years. [CLS] [SEP] Some locations received less than half of their previous record low rainfall amounts. [CLS] [SEP]
