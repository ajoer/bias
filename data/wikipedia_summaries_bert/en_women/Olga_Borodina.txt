[CLS] [SEP] Borodina is featured in many Russian opera recordings on Philips conducted by Valery Gergiyev with the Mariinsky company. [CLS] [SEP] Her Russian heritage is very important to her:I'm one of the mad people who need their roots. [CLS] [SEP] I take nourishment from my native land, my motherland. [CLS] [SEP] I want my children to study in Russia, because they are Russian. [CLS] [SEP] I think this is tremendously important. [CLS] [SEP] But life in St Petersburg is becoming tougher by the day and the Russian spirit, the spirituality that was part and parcel of Russian culture, is almost not there any more. [CLS] [SEP] She pulled out of a production of Carmen at La Scala because the recitatives were spoken instead of sung, and left rehearsals at the Royal Opera House for Aida, directed by Robert Wilson, because she found the conductor's (Antonio Pappano) "approach too alien to the opera". [CLS] [SEP] Subsequently, critics vindicated Borodina and 2011 she returned to Covent Garden to perform in Aida, also conducted by Pappano. [CLS] [SEP] In 2006, the management of the Vienna State Opera "decided to distance itself from an engagement [with Borodina], not just for this production but also for all others" on the night of the première of L'italiana in Algeri. [CLS] [SEP] Borodina was scheduled to sing at the Vienna State Opera in Aida in March 2013.In 2014, Borodina performed the role of Amneris in Aida at the Met in New York, much to critical acclaim.
