[CLS] Typhoon Sarika, known in the Philippines as Typhoon Karen, was a powerful tropical cyclone which affected the Philippines, South China, and Vietnam in mid-October 2016. [SEP] [CLS] The twenty-first named storm and the tenth typhoon of the annual Pacific typhoon season, Sarika developed from a tropical disturbance east of the Philippines on October 13. [SEP] [CLS] The system steadily strengthened as it traveled westwards, becoming a tropical storm later that day and then a typhoon on October 15. [SEP] [CLS] Rapid intensification commenced as Sarika turned to the west-northwest towards Luzon, reaching its peak intensity just before making landfall in Aurora early on October 16. [SEP] [CLS] Sarika weakened significantly as it crossed land, emerging over the South China Sea as a minimal typhoon, then weakening further to a severe tropical storm on October 17. [SEP] [CLS] Sarika maintained its strength for the rest of the day and made landfall in Hainan province in China on October 18. [SEP] [CLS] Turning to the northwest, Sarika weakened quickly as it emerged into the Gulf of Tonkin, before moving onshore once again in Guangxi province on October 19. [SEP] [CLS] The system dissipated shortly after. [SEP] [CLS] Sarika produced significant impacts in the Philippines as a strong typhoon. [SEP] [CLS] Strong winds and flooding rainfall caused landslides, power outages, and disruptions of telecommunications services. [SEP] [CLS] Nearly 13,000 homes were damaged or destroyed, and more than 200,000 people were displaced. [SEP] [CLS] Agricultural damage in the Philippines was severe, totaling ₱3.63 billion (US$75.0 million). [SEP] [CLS] Damage to infrastructure was valued at ₱226 million (US$4.67 million). [SEP] [CLS] No fatalities occurred, though several mountaineers and sailors were rescued. [SEP] [CLS] While not as strong at subsequent landfalls in China, Sarika combined with the northeast monsoon to produce heavy rains across South China and northeast Vietnam. [SEP] [CLS] Hong Kong saw its October hourly rainfall record broken by thunderstorms from Sarika on October 19. [SEP] [CLS] A person went missing after a boat capsized near Wang Chau Island. [SEP] [CLS] Gusty winds and torrential rains affected Hainan, Guangxi, and Guangdong.
