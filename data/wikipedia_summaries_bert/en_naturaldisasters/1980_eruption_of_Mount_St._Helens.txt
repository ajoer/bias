[CLS] On March 27, 1980, a series of volcanic explosions and pyroclastic flows began at Mount St. [SEP] [CLS] Helens in Skamania County, Washington, United States. [SEP] [CLS] It initiated as a series of phreatic blasts from the summit then escalated on May 18, 1980, as a major explosive eruption. [SEP] [CLS] The eruption, which had a Volcanic Explosivity Index of 5, was the most significant to occur in the contiguous 48 U.S. [SEP] [CLS] states since the much smaller 1915 eruption of Lassen Peak in California. [SEP] [CLS] It has often been declared the most disastrous volcanic eruption in U.S. [SEP] [CLS] history. [SEP] [CLS] The eruption was preceded by a two-month series of earthquakes and steam-venting episodes, caused by an injection of magma at shallow depth below the volcano that created a large bulge and a fracture system on the mountain's north slope. [SEP] [CLS] An earthquake at 8:32:11 a.m. [SEP] [CLS] PDT (UTCâˆ’7) on Sunday, May 18, 1980, caused the entire weakened north face to slide away, creating the largest landslide recorded. [SEP] [CLS] This allowed the partly molten, high-pressure gas- and steam-rich rock in the volcano to suddenly explode northwards toward Spirit Lake in a hot mix of lava and pulverized older rock, overtaking the avalanching face. [SEP] [CLS] An eruption column rose 80,000 feet (24 km; 15 mi) into the atmosphere and deposited ash in 11 U.S. [SEP] [CLS] states and two Canadian provinces. [SEP] [CLS] At the same time, snow, ice and several entire glaciers on the volcano melted, forming a series of large lahars (volcanic mudslides) that reached as far as the Columbia River, nearly 50 miles (80 km) to the southwest. [SEP] [CLS] Less severe outbursts continued into the next day, only to be followed by other large, but not as destructive, eruptions later that year. [SEP] [CLS] Thermal energy released during the eruption was equal to 26 megatons of TNT.Approximately 57 people were killed directly, including innkeeper Harry R. [SEP] [CLS] Truman, photographers Reid Blackburn and Robert Landsburg, and geologist David A. [SEP] [CLS] Johnston. [SEP] [CLS] Hundreds of square miles were reduced to wasteland, causing over $1 billion in damage (equivalent to $3.4 billion in 2019), thousands of animals were killed, and Mount St. [SEP] [CLS] Helens was left with a crater on its north side. [SEP] [CLS] At the time of the eruption, the summit of the volcano was owned by the Burlington Northern Railroad, but afterward the land passed to the United States Forest Service. [SEP] [CLS] The area was later preserved, as it was, in the Mount St. [SEP] [CLS] Helens National Volcanic Monument. [SEP] [CLS]
