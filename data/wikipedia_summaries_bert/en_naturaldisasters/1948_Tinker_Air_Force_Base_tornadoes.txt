[CLS] The 1948 Tinker Air Force Base tornadoes were two tornadoes which struck Tinker Air Force Base in Oklahoma City, Oklahoma, on March 20 and 25, 1948. [SEP] [CLS] Both are estimated to have been equivalent to F3 in intensity on the modern Fujita scale of tornado intensity, which was not devised until 1971. [SEP] [CLS] The March 20 tornado was the costliest tornado in Oklahoma history at the time. [SEP] [CLS] On March 25, meteorologists at the base noticed the extreme similarity between the weather conditions of that day and March 20, and later in the day issued a "tornado forecast", which was verified when a tornado struck the base that evening. [SEP] [CLS] This was the first official tornado forecast, as well as the first successful tornado forecast, in recorded history. [SEP] [CLS]
