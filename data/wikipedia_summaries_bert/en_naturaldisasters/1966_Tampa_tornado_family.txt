A deadly tornado family the I-4 corridor in Central Florida from the Tampa Bay area to Brevard County on Monday, April 4, 1966. [CLS] [SEP] Two tornadoes affected the region, each of which featured a path length in excess of 100 miles (160 km). [CLS] [SEP] One of the tornadoes produced estimated F4 damage on the Fujita scale; it remains one of only two F4 tornadoes to strike the U.S. [CLS] [SEP] state of Florida, the other of which occurred in 1958. [CLS] [SEP] Both F4 tornadoes occurred during El Niño years. [CLS] [SEP] A total of 11 people were killed across the state, including three in the city of Tampa and seven in Polk County. [CLS] [SEP] The F4 tornado remains the fourth-deadliest tornado event recorded in Florida; only tornadoes on March 1962, February 2007, and February 1998 caused more deaths in the state. [CLS] [SEP] All of the events were induced by non-tropical cyclones. [CLS] [SEP] The two tornadoes are officially listed as continuous events, but the tornadoes' damage paths did not cross the entire state, and downbursts may have been responsible for destruction near Lake Juliana and the Kissimmee–Saint Cloud area. [CLS] [SEP] However, the combination of tornado and downburst destruction was continuous in Central Florida. [CLS] [SEP]
