[CLS] James Prescott Joule (; 24 December 1818 â€“ 11 October 1889) was an English physicist, mathematician and brewer, born in Salford, Lancashire. [SEP] [CLS] Joule studied the nature of heat, and discovered its relationship to mechanical work (see energy). [SEP] [CLS] This led to the law of conservation of energy, which in turn led to the development of the first law of thermodynamics. [SEP] [CLS] The SI derived unit of energy, the joule, is named after him. [SEP] [CLS] He worked with Lord Kelvin to develop an absolute thermodynamic temperature scale, which came to be called the Kelvin scale. [SEP] [CLS] Joule also made observations of magnetostriction, and he found the relationship between the current through a resistor and the heat dissipated, which is also called Joule's first law. [SEP] [CLS] His experiments about energy transformations were first published in 1843. [SEP] [CLS]
