[CLS] The Great Sheffield Flood was a flood that devastated parts of Sheffield, England, on 11 March 1864, when the Dale Dyke Dam broke as its reservoir was being filled for the first time. [SEP] [CLS] At least 240 people died and more than 600 houses were damaged or destroyed by the flood. [SEP] [CLS] The immediate cause was a crack in the embankment, the cause of which was never determined. [SEP] [CLS] The dam's failure led to reforms in engineering practice, setting standards on specifics that needed to be met when constructing such large-scale structures. [SEP] [CLS] The dam was rebuilt in 1875. [SEP] [CLS]
