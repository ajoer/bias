[CLS] Tropical Cyclone Cliff was first noted as a weak tropical disturbance on April 1, 2007, within a trough of low pressure about 210 km (130 mi) to the southwest of Rotuma. [SEP] [CLS] Over the next couple of days the system drifted towards the southeast and Fiji, in an area of strong wind shear. [SEP] [CLS] During April 3, the system slightly accelerated, as it moved towards the south-southeast before the westerly wind shear around the system relaxed sufficiently to allow the depression to consolidate while it was located near Vanua Levu.
