[CLS] Typhoon Cecil, known in the Philippines as Typhoon Loleng, was a mid-season tropical cyclone that affected Japan and South Korea during August 1982. [SEP] [CLS] An area of disturbed weather formed to the north of Truk on July 31 and tracked westward over the next several days. [SEP] [CLS] Following an increase in shower activity and a decrease in wind shear, a tropical depression developed on August 4. [SEP] [CLS] Two days later, the depression strengthened into a tropical storm. [SEP] [CLS] After turning northwestward and then northward, Cecil intensified into a typhoon on August 7, and then began to deepen at a rapid clip. [SEP] [CLS] On August 8, Cecil attained its maximum intensity as it brushed Taiwan. [SEP] [CLS] There, 19 people were killed, including 4 in Wugu District, where 2,800 families sought shelter. [SEP] [CLS] After pulling away from Taiwan, Typhoon Cecil moved northwestward, and then on August 10, turned to the north-northeast. [SEP] [CLS] Colder air, cooler waters, and higher shear contributed to a weakening trend, and Cecil was downgraded to a tropical storm on August 11. [SEP] [CLS] Although Cecil passed east of Japan, it came close enough to the country to drop heavy rains. [SEP] [CLS] Nation-wide, three people were killed and two were injured. [SEP] [CLS] A total of 2,100 households lost power in Hinokage. [SEP] [CLS] On August 14, Cecil turned east and struck South Korea as a minimal tropical storm before dissipating over the Sea of Japan. [SEP] [CLS] Throughout South Korea, 35 people were killed, 28 went missing, and 28 others sustained injuries. [SEP] [CLS] Almost 1,300 houses were flooded, which resulted in 6,200 people becoming homeless. [SEP] [CLS] Damage was estimated at US$30 million. [SEP] [CLS]
