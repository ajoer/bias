[CLS] Severe Tropical Cyclone Hamish was a powerful tropical cyclone that caused extensive damage to the Great Barrier Reef and coastal Queensland, Australia, in March 2009. [SEP] [CLS] The eighth named storm of the 2008â€“09 Australian region cyclone season, Hamish developed out of an area of low pressure on 4 March near the Cape York Peninsula. [SEP] [CLS] The storm rapidly developed into a Category 1 cyclone on the Australian intensity scale the next day. [SEP] [CLS] On 6 March, an eye developed, and Hamish strengthened into a Category 3 cyclone. [SEP] [CLS] Deep convection developed around the eye, fueling further intensification, which allowed the storm to become a Category 5 tropical cyclone late on 7 March. [SEP] [CLS] Hamish made its closest approach to land on 8 March, but continued moving southeastward. [SEP] [CLS] Eventually, the cyclone weakened and turned back towards the northwest, weakening into a remnant low on 11 March, before finally dissipating on 14 March. [SEP] [CLS]
