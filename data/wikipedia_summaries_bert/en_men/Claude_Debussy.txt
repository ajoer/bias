[CLS] (Achille) Claude Debussy (French: [aʃil klod dəbysi]; 22 August 1862 – 25 March 1918) was a French composer. [SEP] [CLS] He is sometimes seen as the first Impressionist composer, although he vigorously rejected the term. [SEP] [CLS] He was among the most influential composers of the late 19th and early 20th centuries. [SEP] [CLS] Born to a family of modest means and little cultural involvement, Debussy showed enough musical talent to be admitted at the age of ten to France's leading music college, the Conservatoire de Paris. [SEP] [CLS] He originally studied the piano, but found his vocation in innovative composition, despite the disapproval of the Conservatoire's conservative professors. [SEP] [CLS] He took many years to develop his mature style, and was nearly 40 when he achieved international fame in 1902 with the only opera he completed, Pelléas et Mélisande. [SEP] [CLS] Debussy's orchestral works include Prélude à l'après-midi d'un faune (1894), Nocturnes (1897–1899) and Images (1905–1912). [SEP] [CLS] His music was to a considerable extent a reaction against Wagner and the German musical tradition. [SEP] [CLS] He regarded the classical symphony as obsolete and sought an alternative in his "symphonic sketches", La mer (1903–1905). [SEP] [CLS] His piano works include two books of Préludes and two of Études. [SEP] [CLS] Throughout his career he wrote mélodies based on a wide variety of poetry, including his own. [SEP] [CLS] He was greatly influenced by the Symbolist poetic movement of the later 19th century. [SEP] [CLS] A small number of works, including the early La Damoiselle élue and the late Le Martyre de saint Sébastien have important parts for chorus. [SEP] [CLS] In his final years, he focused on chamber music, completing three of six planned sonatas for different combinations of instruments. [SEP] [CLS] With early influences including Russian and far-eastern music, Debussy developed his own style of harmony and orchestral colouring, derided – and unsuccessfully resisted – by much of the musical establishment of the day. [SEP] [CLS] His works have strongly influenced a wide range of composers including Béla Bartók, Olivier Messiaen, George Benjamin, and the jazz pianist and composer Bill Evans. [SEP] [CLS] Debussy died from cancer at his home in Paris at the age of 55 after a composing career of a little more than 30 years. [SEP] [CLS]
