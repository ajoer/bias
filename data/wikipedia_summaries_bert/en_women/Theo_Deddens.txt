With God, all things are possible is the motto of the U.S. [CLS] [SEP] state of Ohio. [CLS] [SEP] Quoted from the Gospel of Matthew, verse 19:26, it is the only state motto taken directly from the Bible (Greek: παρὰ δὲ θεῷ πάντα δυνατά, para de Theō panta dynata). [CLS] [SEP] It is defined in section 5.06 of the Ohio Revised Code and sometimes appears beneath the Seal of Ohio. [CLS] [SEP] The motto was adopted in 1959 and survived a federal constitutional challenge in 2001. [CLS] [SEP] The state maintains that it is a generic expression of optimism rather than an endorsement of a particular religion. [CLS] [SEP]
