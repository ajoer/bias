[CLS] The 2015 South India floods resulted from heavy rainfall generated by the annual northeast monsoon in November–December 2015. [SEP] [CLS] They affected the Coromandel Coast region of the South Indian states of Tamil Nadu and Andhra Pradesh. [SEP] [CLS] More than 500 people were killed and over 1.8 million (18 lakh) people were displaced.
