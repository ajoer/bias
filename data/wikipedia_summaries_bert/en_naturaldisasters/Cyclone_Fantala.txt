[CLS] Very Intense Tropical Cyclone Fantala was the strongest tropical cyclone of the South-West Indian Ocean in terms of sustained winds. [SEP] [CLS] Part of the 2015–16 cyclone season, Fantala formed on 11 April to the south of Diego Garcia, an island in the central Indian Ocean. [SEP] [CLS] With a ridge to the south, the storm moved westward for several days while gaining strength, aided by warm waters and decreasing wind shear. [SEP] [CLS] Late on 17 April, the Météo-France office on Réunion (MFR) estimated peak 10-minute winds of 250 km/h (155 mph), making Fantala the strongest tropical cyclone of the basin in terms of 10-minute sustained winds. [SEP] [CLS] The Joint Typhoon Warning Center (JTWC) estimated peak 1-minute winds of 285 km/h (180 mph), equivalent to Category 5 intensity on the Saffir-Simpson scale, also the strongest on record in the South-West Indian Ocean, in terms of maximum sustained wind speed. [SEP] [CLS] Early on 18 April, Fantala reached its peak intensity, with a minimum central pressure of 910 millibars (27 inHg). [SEP] [CLS] While near peak intensity, Fantala passed near the Farquhar Group of the Seychelles, damaging most of the buildings in the small archipelago. [SEP] [CLS] Later on 18 April, Fantala had weakened to an intense tropical cyclone and slowed its forward motion, eventually reversing its direction of movement. [SEP] [CLS] After fluctuating in strength, the disorganized system reversed direction again, making its closest approach to Madagascar. [SEP] [CLS] Fantala degenerated into a remnant low on 24 April, and the remnants continued toward Tanzania. [SEP] [CLS] There, heavy rainfall resulted in flooding that washed away roads and houses, killing 13 people. [SEP] [CLS] Rains extended further into Kenya, with similar effects. [SEP] [CLS]
