[CLS] Tiberius ( ty-BEER-ee-əs; Tiberius Caesar Augustus; 16 November 42 BC – 16 March 37 AD) was the second Roman emperor, reigning from AD 14 to 37. [SEP] [CLS] He succeeded his stepfather, Augustus. [SEP] [CLS] Born to Tiberius Claudius Nero and Livia Drusilla to a family of the noted patrician gens Claudia, he was given the name Tiberius Claudius Nero. [SEP] [CLS] His mother divorced Nero and married Octavian—later to ascend to Emperor as Augustus—who officially became his stepfather. [SEP] [CLS] Tiberius would later marry Augustus' daughter (from his marriage to Scribonia), Julia the Elder, and even later be adopted by Augustus. [SEP] [CLS] Through the adoption, he officially became a Julian, assuming the name Tiberius Julius Caesar. [SEP] [CLS] The emperors after Tiberius would continue this blended dynasty of both families for the following thirty years; historians have named it the Julio-Claudian dynasty. [SEP] [CLS] His relationship to the other emperors of this dynasty was as follows: he was the stepson of Augustus, grand-uncle of Caligula, paternal uncle of Claudius, and great-grand uncle of Nero. [SEP] [CLS] Tiberius' 22-and-a-half-year reign would be the longest after that of Augustus until that of Emperor Antoninus Pius, who surpassed his reign by a few months. [SEP] [CLS] Tiberius was one of the greatest Roman generals; his conquest of Pannonia, Dalmatia, Raetia, and (temporarily) parts of Germania laid the foundations for the northern frontier. [SEP] [CLS] Even so, he came to be remembered as a dark, reclusive and sombre ruler who never really desired to be emperor; Pliny the Elder called him "the gloomiest of men". [SEP] [CLS] After the death of his son Drusus Julius Caesar in AD 23, Tiberius became more reclusive and aloof. [SEP] [CLS] In 26 AD he removed himself from Rome and left administration largely in the hands of his unscrupulous Praetorian prefects Lucius Aelius Sejanus and Quintus Naevius Sutorius Macro. [SEP] [CLS] When Tiberius died, he was succeeded by his grand-nephew and adopted grandson, Caligula. [SEP] [CLS]
