[CLS] Hurricane Martha has been the only known tropical cyclone to make landfall in Panama. [SEP] [CLS] The eighteenth named storm and twelfth hurricane of the 1969 Atlantic hurricane season, Martha developed in the southwestern Caribbean Sea on November 21. [SEP] [CLS] Initially, the storm developed with sustained winds of 50 mph (85 km/h), skipping tropical depression status. [SEP] [CLS] It remained stationary and quickly intensified into a hurricane. [SEP] [CLS] Martha attained maximum sustained winds of 90 mph (150 km/h) on November 22. [SEP] [CLS] Subsequently, Martha weakened and drifted southward. [SEP] [CLS] On November 24, Martha made landfall in Veraguas Province, Panama, as a strong tropical storm. [SEP] [CLS] The system weakened to a tropical depression and dissipated over land on November 25. [SEP] [CLS] Because the storm weakened prior to landfall, strong winds were not expected or reported in the impacted countries.
