[CLS] The 1985 Election Day floods — also known as the Killer Floods of 1985 in West Virginia — produced the costliest floods in both West Virginia and Virginia in November 1985. [SEP] [CLS] The event occurred after Hurricane Juan, a tropical cyclone in the 1985 Atlantic hurricane season, meandered near the coast of Louisiana before striking just west of Pensacola, Florida late on October 31. [SEP] [CLS] Juan moved northward into Canada, but spawned another system that spread moderate rainfall across the Mid-Atlantic States, wetting soils. [SEP] [CLS] On November 3, a low pressure area developed south of Florida and moved northeastward along a cold front, bringing a plume of moisture influenced by Juan's previous track. [SEP] [CLS] The storm moved through the southeastern United States, stalling on November 5 west of Washington, D.C. [SEP] [CLS] before turning out to sea the next day. [SEP] [CLS] The event was known as the Election Day floods due to its concurrence with elections in Virginia. [SEP] [CLS] Damage was heaviest in Virginia and West Virginia. [SEP] [CLS] In the former state, the rainfall peaked at 19.77 in (502 mm) just northeast of Montebello. [SEP] [CLS] The rains increased levels along many rivers to record heights across Virginia, including the James River which crested at 42.15 ft (12.85 m) at a station called Holcomb Rock, the highest level in the state. [SEP] [CLS] In Roanoke, the Roanoke River rose 18.57 ft (5.66 m) in ten hours to a peak of 23.35 ft (7.12 m), considered a 1 in 200 year event. [SEP] [CLS] In the city, many residents had to be rescued after they were trapped, and three people drowned by driving into flooded waters. [SEP] [CLS] Considered the worst flood on record in the city, Roanoke sustained $225 million in damage, with 3,100 damaged homes and businesses. [SEP] [CLS] There was also flooding in Richmond after the James River crested at the second-highest level on record. [SEP] [CLS] Throughout Virginia, damage was estimated at $753 million, making it the state's costliest flood at the time, and there were 22 deaths. [SEP] [CLS] In West Virginia, 27 river gauging stations were 1 in 100 year events, mostly along the Potomac and Monongahela basins. [SEP] [CLS] As most of West Virginia's liveable land is along flood plains, the river flooding caused heavy damage in the state, mostly in the eastern portion. [SEP] [CLS] High waters washed away topsoil and thousands of trees, and over 13,000 homes and businesses were damaged or destroyed in the state. [SEP] [CLS] Damage was estimated at nearly $700 million, making it West Virginia's costliest flood, and there were 38 deaths. [SEP] [CLS] Flooding also affected Maryland, although to a lesser degree than neighboring Virginia, with $21 million in damage and one death. [SEP] [CLS] There was also tidal flooding in the state along the Chesapeake Bay from the storm, which washed away beaches just weeks after Hurricane Gloria affected the coastline. [SEP] [CLS] In Pennsylvania, flooding was worst along the Monongahela River in the state's southwest portion. [SEP] [CLS] During the storm, a power company opened the flood gates of the Lake Lynn dam along the river to preserve its integrity, triggering a class action lawsuit that ultimately failed. [SEP] [CLS] The floods damaged or destroyed 3,349 houses in Pennsylvania, causing $83 million in damage, as well as one death. [SEP] [CLS] Overall damage was estimated at $1.4 billion, which would have been the fourth costliest United States hurricanes if it were a tropical cyclone, and there were 62 overall deaths. [SEP] [CLS] The flooding spurred changes to warning practices by the National Weather Service and the Government of Virginia. [SEP] [CLS] In December 2011, the United States Army Corps of Engineers completed a flood mitigation project in Roanoke, Virginia that began following the 1985 floods. [SEP] [CLS]
