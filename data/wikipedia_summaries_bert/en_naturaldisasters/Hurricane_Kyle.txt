Hurricane Kyle was the fifth-longest-lived Atlantic tropical or subtropical cyclone on record. [CLS] [SEP] The eleventh named storm and third hurricane of the 2002 Atlantic hurricane season, Kyle developed as a subtropical cyclone on September 20 to the east-southeast of Bermuda. [CLS] [SEP] Looping westward, it transitioned into a tropical cyclone and became a hurricane on September 25. [CLS] [SEP] For the next two weeks, Kyle tracked generally westward, oscillating in strength several times because of fluctuations in environmental conditions. [CLS] [SEP] On October 11, the cyclone turned northeastward and made landfalls near Charleston, South Carolina, and Long Beach, North Carolina, at tropical storm status. [CLS] [SEP] After lasting as a cyclone for 22 days, Kyle dissipated on October 12 as it was absorbed by an approaching cold front. [CLS] [SEP] The hurricane brought light precipitation to Bermuda, but no significant damage was reported there. [CLS] [SEP] Moderate rainfall accompanied its two landfalls in the United States, causing localized flash flooding and road closures. [CLS] [SEP] Floodwaters forced the evacuation of a nursing home and several mobile homes in South Carolina. [CLS] [SEP] Kyle spawned at least four tornadoes, the costliest of which struck Georgetown, South Carolina; it damaged 106 buildings and destroyed seven others, causing eight injuries. [CLS] [SEP] Overall damage totaled about $5 million (2002 USD, $7.11 million 2020 USD), and no direct deaths were reported. [CLS] [SEP] However, the remnants of Kyle contributed to one indirect death in the British Isles. [CLS] [SEP]
