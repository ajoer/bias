[CLS] Korean Air Lines Flight 007 alternative theories concerns the various theories put forward regarding the shooting down of Korean Air Lines Flight 007. [SEP] [CLS] The aircraft was en route from New York City via Anchorage to Seoul on September 1, 1983, when it strayed into prohibited Soviet airspace and was shot down by Soviet fighter jets. [SEP] [CLS] Flight 007 has been the subject of ongoing controversy and has spawned a number of conspiracy theories. [SEP] [CLS] Many of these are based on the suppression of evidence such as the flight data recorders, unexplained details such as the role of a USAF RC-135 surveillance aircraft, or merely Cold War disinformation and propaganda. [SEP] [CLS] Some commentators also felt that the International Civil Aviation Organization (ICAO) report into the incident failed to address key points adequately, such as the reason for the aircraft's deviation. [SEP] [CLS] The release of flight data recorder evidence by the Russian Federation in 1993, ten years after the event, seriously challenged many of these theories. [SEP] [CLS] Some alternative interpretations focus on evidential questions largely independent of political considerations. [SEP] [CLS] One of the first theories was that Space Shuttle Challenger and a satellite were monitoring the airliner's progress over Soviet territory. [SEP] [CLS] Defence Attach√©, which printed this claim, was sued by Korean Air Lines and forced to pay damages and print an apology. [SEP] [CLS]
