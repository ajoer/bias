[CLS] [SEP] It occurred at 11:56 Nepal Standard Time on 25 April 2015, with a magnitude of 7.8Mw or 8.1Ms and a maximum Mercalli Intensity of VIII (Severe). [CLS] [SEP] Its epicenter was east of Gorkha District at Barpak, Gorkha, and its hypocenter was at a depth of approximately 8.2 km (5.1 mi). [CLS] [SEP] It was the worst natural disaster to strike Nepal since the 1934 Nepal–Bihar earthquake. [CLS] [SEP] The ground motion recorded in the capital of Nepal was of low frequency, which, along with its occurrence at an hour where many people in rural areas were working outdoors, decreased the loss of property and human lives.The earthquake triggered an avalanche on Mount Everest, killing 21, making 25 April 2015 the deadliest day on the mountain in history. [CLS] [SEP] The earthquake triggered another huge avalanche in the Langtang valley, where 250 people were reported missing.Hundreds of thousands of Nepalese were made homeless with entire villages flattened, across many districts of the country.

[CLS] [SEP] Geophysicists and other experts had warned for decades that Nepal was vulnerable to a deadly earthquake, particularly because of its geology, urbanization, and architecture. [CLS] [SEP] Dharahara, also called Bhimsen Tower, which was a nine-storey and 61.88-metre-tall tower was destroyed. [CLS] [SEP] It was a part of the architecture of Kathmandu recognized by UNESCO. [CLS] [SEP] Continued aftershocks occurred throughout Nepal at the intervals of 15–20 minutes, with one shock reaching a magnitude of 6.7 on 26 April at 12:54:08 NST. [CLS] [SEP] The country also had a continued risk of landslides.A major aftershock occurred on 12 May 2015 at 12:50 NST with a moment magnitude (Mw) of 7.3. [CLS] [SEP] The epicenter was near the Chinese border between the capital of Kathmandu and Mount Everest. [CLS] [SEP] More than 200 people were killed and over 2,500 were injured by this aftershock, and many were left homeless. [CLS] [SEP]
