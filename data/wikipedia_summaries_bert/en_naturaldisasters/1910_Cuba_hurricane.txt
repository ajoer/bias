[CLS] The 1910 Cuba hurricane, popularly known as the Cyclone of the Five Days, was an unusual and destructive tropical cyclone that struck Cuba and the United States in October 1910. [SEP] [CLS] It formed in the southern Caribbean on October 9 and strengthened as it moved northwestward, becoming a hurricane on October 12. [SEP] [CLS] After crossing the western tip of Cuba, it peaked in intensity on October 16, corresponding to Category 4 on the Saffir-Simpson Hurricane Scale. [SEP] [CLS] That same day, the hurricane moved in a counterclockwise loop and hit Cuba again. [SEP] [CLS] It then tracked toward Florida, landing near Cape Romano. [SEP] [CLS] After moving through the state, it hugged the coast of the Southeastern United States on its way out to sea. [SEP] [CLS] Due to its unusual loop, initial reports suggested it was two separate storms that developed and hit land in rapid succession. [SEP] [CLS] Its track was subject to much debate at the time; eventually, it was identified as a single storm. [SEP] [CLS] Analysis of the event gave a greater understanding of weather systems that took similar paths. [SEP] [CLS] The hurricane is considered one of the worst natural disasters in Cuban history. [SEP] [CLS] Damage was extensive, and thousands were left homeless. [SEP] [CLS] It also had a widespread impact in Florida, including the destruction of houses and flooding.
