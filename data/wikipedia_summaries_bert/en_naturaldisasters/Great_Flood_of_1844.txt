[CLS] The Great Flood of 1844 is the biggest flood ever recorded on the Missouri River and Upper Mississippi River, in North America, in terms of discharge. [SEP] [CLS] The adjusted economic impact was not as great as subsequent floods because of the small population in the region at the time. [SEP] [CLS] The flood devastation was particularly widespread since the region had few levees at the time, so the waters were able to spread far from the normal banks. [SEP] [CLS] Among the hardest hit in terms of mortality were the Wyandot Indians, who lost 100 people in the diseases that occurred after the flood in the vicinity of today's Kansas City, Kansas. [SEP] [CLS] The flood formed a large sandbar in front of the Wayne City Landing at Independence, Missouri, which caused settlers to go further east to Westport Landing in Kansas City, which resulted in significant local economic and cultural impact. [SEP] [CLS] Independence had been the trailhead for several key emigrant trails, prior to 1846 notably both the Santa Fe Trail and one alternative eastern starting branch of the Oregon Trail. [SEP] [CLS] After the Mexicanâ€“American War treaty of 1848, the Oregon Trail's trailhead became a trailhead of the California Trail and an alternative beginning for the Mormon Trail. [SEP] [CLS] In 1850, the United States Congress passed the Swamp Land Act providing land grants to build stronger levees. [SEP] [CLS] The flood is the highest recorded for the Mississippi River at St. [SEP] [CLS] Louis (1,300,000 cubic feet per second in 1844 vs. [SEP] [CLS] 782,000 in 1951 and 1,030,000 in 1993).
