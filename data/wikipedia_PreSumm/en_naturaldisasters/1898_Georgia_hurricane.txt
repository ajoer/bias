[CLS] The 1898 Georgia hurricane was a major hurricane that hit the U.S. [SEP] [CLS] state of Georgia, as well as the strongest on record in the state. [SEP] [CLS] It was first observed on September 29, although modern researchers estimated that it developed four days earlier to the east of the Lesser Antilles. [SEP] [CLS] The hurricane maintained a general northwest track throughout its duration, and it reached peak winds of 135 mph (215 km/h) on October 2. [SEP] [CLS] That day, it made landfall on Cumberland Island in Camden County, Georgia, causing record storm surge flooding. [SEP] [CLS] The hurricane caused heavy damage throughout the region, and killed at least 179 people. [SEP] [CLS] Impact was most severe in Brunswick, where a 16 ft (4.9 m) storm surge was recorded. [SEP] [CLS] Overall damage was estimated at $1.5 million (1898 USD), most of which occurred in Georgia.
