[CLS] [SEP] The 14th named storm of the 2005 Pacific typhoon season, Nabi formed on August 29 to the east of the Northern Mariana Islands. [CLS] [SEP] It moved westward and passed about 55 km (35 mi) north of Saipan on August 31 as an intensifying typhoon. [CLS] [SEP] On the next day, the Joint Typhoon Warning Center upgraded the storm to super typhoon status, with winds equivalent to that of a Category 5 hurricane on the Saffir–Simpson Hurricane Scale. [CLS] [SEP] The Japan Meteorological Agency estimated peak ten-minute winds of 175 km/h (110 mph) on September 2. [CLS] [SEP] Nabi weakened while curving to the north, striking the Japanese island of Kyushu on September 6. [CLS] [SEP] After brushing South Korea, the storm turned to the northeast, passing over Hokkaido before becoming extratropical on September 8, before dissipating on September 12. [CLS] [SEP] The typhoon first affected the Northern Mariana Islands, where it left US$2.5 million in damage, while damaging or destroying 114 homes. [CLS] [SEP] The damage was enough to warrant a disaster declaration from the United States government. [CLS] [SEP] While passing near Okinawa, Nabi produced gusty winds and caused minor damage. [CLS] [SEP] Later, the western fringe of the storm caused several traffic accidents in Busan, South Korea, and throughout the country Nabi killed six people and caused US$115.4 million in damage. [CLS] [SEP] About 250,000 people evacuated along the Japanese island of Kyushu ahead of the storm, and there were disruptions to train, ferry, and airline services.
