John Quincy Adams ( (listen); July 11, 1767 – February 23, 1848) was an American statesman, diplomat, lawyer, and diarist who served as the sixth president of the United States, from 1825 to 1829. [CLS] [SEP] He previously served as the eighth United States Secretary of State from 1817 to 1825. [CLS] [SEP] During his long diplomatic and political career, Adams also served as an ambassador, and as a member of the United States Senate and United States House of Representatives representing Massachusetts. [CLS] [SEP] He was the eldest son of John Adams, who served as the second US president from 1797 to 1801, and First Lady Abigail Adams. [CLS] [SEP] Initially a Federalist like his father, he won election to the presidency as a member of the Democratic-Republican Party, and in the mid-1830s became affiliated with the Whig Party. [CLS] [SEP] Born in what is now Quincy, Massachusetts (then part of the town of Braintree), Adams spent much of his youth in Europe, where his father served as a diplomat. [CLS] [SEP] After returning to the United States, Adams established a successful legal practice in Boston. [CLS] [SEP] In 1794, President George Washington appointed Adams as the U.S. [CLS] [SEP] ambassador to the Netherlands, and Adams would serve in high-ranking diplomatic posts until 1801, when Thomas Jefferson took office as president. [CLS] [SEP] Federalist leaders in Massachusetts arranged for Adams's election to the United States Senate in 1802, but Adams broke with the Federalist Party over foreign policy and was denied re-election. [CLS] [SEP] In 1809, Adams was appointed as the U.S. [CLS] [SEP] ambassador to Russia by President James Madison, a member of the Democratic-Republican Party. [CLS] [SEP] Adams held diplomatic posts for the duration of Madison's presidency, and he served as part of the American delegation that negotiated an end to the War of 1812. [CLS] [SEP] In 1817, newly elected president James Monroe selected Adams as his Secretary of State. [CLS] [SEP] In that role, Adams negotiated the Adams–Onís Treaty, which provided for the American acquisition of Florida. [CLS] [SEP] He also helped formulate the Monroe Doctrine, which became a key tenet of U.S. [CLS] [SEP] foreign policy. [CLS] [SEP] The 1824 presidential election was contested by Adams, Andrew Jackson, William H. [CLS] [SEP] Crawford, and Henry Clay, all of whom were members of the Democratic-Republican Party. [CLS] [SEP] As no candidate won a majority of the electoral vote, the House of Representatives held a contingent election to determine the president, and Adams won that contingent election with the support of Clay. [CLS] [SEP] As president, Adams called for an ambitious agenda that included federally funded infrastructure projects, the establishment of a national university, and engagement with the countries of Latin America, but many of his initiatives were defeated in Congress. [CLS] [SEP] During Adams's presidency, the Democratic-Republican Party polarized into two major camps: one group, known as the National Republican Party, supported President Adams, while the other group, known as the Democratic Party, was led by Andrew Jackson. [CLS] [SEP] The Democrats proved to be more effective political organizers than Adams and his National Republican supporters, and Jackson decisively defeated Adams in the 1828 presidential election. [CLS] [SEP] Rather than retiring from public service, Adams won election to the House of Representatives, where he would serve from 1831 to his death in 1848. [CLS] [SEP] He joined the Anti-Masonic Party in the early 1830s before becoming a member of the Whig Party, which united those opposed to President Jackson. [CLS] [SEP] During his time in Congress, Adams became increasingly critical of slavery and of the Southern leaders whom he believed controlled the Democratic Party. [CLS] [SEP] He was particularly opposed to the annexation of Texas and the Mexican–American War, which he saw as a war to extend slavery. [CLS] [SEP] He also led the repeal of the "gag rule", which had prevented the House of Representatives from debating petitions to abolish slavery. [CLS] [SEP] Historians generally concur that Adams was one of the greatest diplomats and secretaries of state in American history. [CLS] [SEP] They typically rank him as a mediocre president who had an ambitious agenda but could not get it passed by Congress. [CLS] [SEP]
