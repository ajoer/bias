[CLS] Severe Tropical Cyclone Joni was a damaging tropical cyclone that impacted the island nations of Tuvalu and Fiji. [SEP] [CLS] It was first noted within the South Pacific Convergence Zone at the start of December 1992, as a shallow tropical depression in the vicinity of the island nation Tuvalu. [SEP] [CLS] Over the next few days the system gradually developed further as it affected Tuvalu, before it was declared to be a tropical cyclone and named Joni by the Fiji Meteorological Service (FMS) during December 7. [SEP] [CLS] Over the next couple of days the system intensified further as it was steered south-westwards and posed a threat towards the Fijian dependency of Rotuma and the French territory of Wallis and Futuna. [SEP] [CLS] The system subsequently peaked as a Category 4 severe tropical cyclone on the Australian tropical cyclone intensity scale as it approached the Fijian Islands during December 10. [SEP] [CLS] Over the next couple of days the system moved through the Fijian Islands, before it became an extratropical cyclone during December 13. [SEP] [CLS] The system was last noted during the next day as it was absorbed by a mid-latitude trough of low pressure to the east of New Zealand. [SEP] [CLS] Joni caused gale to storm force winds on the Tuvuluan island of Niulakita and minor damage to most of the Tuvuluan islands. [SEP] [CLS] Total damages to crops in the island nation were estimated at AU$6.9 thousand (US$5 thousand). [SEP] [CLS] There were no damages reported on the islands of Wallis and Futuna or Rotuma, while 1 person was killed, 10 people went missing and total damages were estimated at FJ$2 million (US$1.6 million) in Fiji. [SEP] [CLS] The main impacts of Joni in Fiji were confined to the Western Division, with the islands of Yasawa, Mamanuca, Viti Levu, Kadavu and Vatulele being the worst affected areas. [SEP] [CLS] Damages in both Tuvalu and Fiji were exacerbated a month later by Severe Tropical Cyclones Nina and Kina interacting with each other. [SEP] [CLS] Due to the impact of this system, the name Joni was subsequently retired from the list of names for the region by the World Meteorological Organization. [SEP] [CLS]
