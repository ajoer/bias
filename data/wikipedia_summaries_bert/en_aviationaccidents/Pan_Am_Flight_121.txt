Pan Am Flight 121 was a scheduled Pan American World Airways flight from Karachi to Istanbul. [CLS] [SEP] On the evening of June 18, 1947, the Lockheed L-049 Constellation serving the flight, known as the Clipper Eclipse (previously Clipper Dublin), suffered an engine failure. [CLS] [SEP] This led to the overheating of the remaining engines until one caught fire, which spread to the aircraft. [CLS] [SEP] The heat from burning magnesium parts caused the engine to fall from the aircraft, leaving it unable to maintain altitude. [CLS] [SEP] Early in the morning of June 19, 1947 the plane crashed in the Syrian desert 4 miles (6.4 km) from the town of Mayadin. [CLS] [SEP] Fifteen people were killed, including 7 crew and 8 passengers. [CLS] [SEP] The three surviving crew members were third officer Gene Roddenberry (who went on to create the original Star Trek television series), the chief purser, and one stewardess. [CLS] [SEP] After rescuing passengers from the burning wreckage, Roddenberry took control as the ranking flight officer and organized scout parties to find aid. [CLS] [SEP] By midday, the Syrian Army took the survivors to the hospital at Deir ez-Zor. [CLS] [SEP] The majority returned to the United States quickly while Roddenberry remained in Syria for two weeks to answer questions about the crash from the local government. [CLS] [SEP]
