[CLS] Hurricane Gladys was the first Atlantic hurricane to be observed each by the Hurricane Hunters, radar imagery, and photographs from space. [SEP] [CLS] The seventh named storm and fifth hurricane (including one unnamed hurricane) of the 1968 season, Gladys formed on October 13 in the western Caribbean from a broad disturbance related to a tropical wave. [SEP] [CLS] The storm moved north-northwestward, becoming a hurricane before striking Cuba on October 16. [SEP] [CLS] Gladys later reached peak winds of 85 mph (140 km/h) just before making landfall near Homosassa on the western coast of Florida on October 19. [SEP] [CLS] The hurricane crossed the state and continued northeastward, passing just east of Cape Hatteras on October 20. [SEP] [CLS] The next day, Gladys became extratropical and was absorbed by a cold front over Nova Scotia. [SEP] [CLS] In Cuba, the threat of the hurricane prompted widespread evacuations. [SEP] [CLS] Gladys caused flash flooding and heavily damaged the tobacco crop. [SEP] [CLS] Damage in the country was estimated at $12 million (1968 USD), and there were six deaths. [SEP] [CLS] While passing west of the Florida Keys, the hurricane produced strong winds that briefly cut communications to the Dry Tortugas, but damage was minor. [SEP] [CLS] Near where Gladys made landfall, winds gusted to 100 mph (160 km/h) and tides reached 6.5 ft (2.0 m) above normal. [SEP] [CLS] There was heavy beach erosion and flooding along the coast, while the winds knocked down trees and caused power outages. [SEP] [CLS] Across the state, damage was estimated at $6.7 million (1968 USD), and three people were indirectly killed. [SEP] [CLS] Heavy rainfall in South Carolina caused minor river flooding. [SEP] [CLS] When paralleling just off the coast of North Carolina, Gladys was responsible for breaking the state's worst drought since 1932, and proved more beneficial than the minor storm damage there. [SEP] [CLS] Later, Gladys killed two people in Atlantic Canada and caused coastal damage in Prince Edward Island. [SEP] [CLS]
