The 1974 Pacific typhoon season was the only season on record to not feature a Super Typhoon. [CLS] [SEP] It has no official bounds; it ran year-round in 1974, but most tropical cyclones tend to form in the northwestern Pacific Ocean between June and December. [CLS] [SEP] These dates conventionally delimit the period of each year when most tropical cyclones form in the northwestern Pacific Ocean. [CLS] [SEP] The 1974 season was at the time the only season to not produce a Category 5 equivalent typhoon, a feat that would not be matched until 3 years later and 43 years later. [CLS] [SEP] The scope of this article is limited to the Pacific Ocean, north of the equator and west of the international date line. [CLS] [SEP] Storms that form east of the date line and north of the equator are called hurricanes; see 1974 Pacific hurricane season. [CLS] [SEP] Tropical Storms formed in the entire west pacific basin were assigned a name by the Joint Typhoon Warning Center. [CLS] [SEP] Tropical depressions in this basin have the "W" suffix added to their number. [CLS] [SEP] Tropical depressions that enter or form in the Philippine area of responsibility are assigned a name by the Philippine Atmospheric, Geophysical and Astronomical Services Administration or PAGASA. [CLS] [SEP] This can often result in the same storm having two names. [CLS] [SEP]
