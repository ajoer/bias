[CLS] Tropical Cyclone Tam (RSMC Nadi designation: 04F, JTWC designation: 06P) was the first named storm of the 2005â€“06 South Pacific cyclone season. [SEP] [CLS] Forming out of a tropical depression on January 6, the storm gradually intensified, becoming a tropical cyclone on January 12 and receiving the name Tam. [SEP] [CLS] Although it was traveling at a quick pace, the storm gained organization and reached its peak intensity with winds of 85 km/h (50 mph) the following day. [SEP] [CLS] However, the increasing forward motion of the storm, combined with strengthening wind shear, caused Tam to rapidly weaken on January 14. [SEP] [CLS] Around that time, it entered the Tropical Cyclone Warning Centre in Wellington, New Zealand's area of responsibility. [SEP] [CLS] Shortly thereafter, the storm transitioned into an extratropical cyclone and dissipated early the next day. [SEP] [CLS] Cyclone Tam produced heavy rainfall and strong winds over American Samoa upon being named. [SEP] [CLS] The precipitation caused several mudslides and flooding, which inflicted $26,000 in damage. [SEP] [CLS] The storm also had minor effects on Niue, Tonga, and Futuna. [SEP] [CLS]
