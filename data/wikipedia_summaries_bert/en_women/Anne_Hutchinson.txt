Anne Hutchinson (née Marbury; July 1591 – August 1643) was a Puritan spiritual advisor, religious reformer, and an important participant in the Antinomian Controversy which shook the infant Massachusetts Bay Colony from 1636 to 1638. [CLS] [SEP] Her strong religious convictions were at odds with the established Puritan clergy in the Boston area and her popularity and charisma helped create a theological schism that threatened to destroy the Puritans' religious community in New England. [CLS] [SEP] She was eventually tried and convicted, then banished from the colony with many of her supporters. [CLS] [SEP] Hutchinson was born in Alford, Lincolnshire, England, the daughter of Francis Marbury, an Anglican cleric and school teacher who gave her a far better education than most other girls received. [CLS] [SEP] She lived in London as a young adult, and there married a friend from home, William Hutchinson. [CLS] [SEP] The couple moved back to Alford where they began following preacher John Cotton in the nearby port of Boston, Lincolnshire. [CLS] [SEP] Cotton was compelled to emigrate in 1633, and the Hutchinsons followed a year later with their 11 children and soon became well established in the growing settlement of Boston in New England. [CLS] [SEP] Hutchinson was a midwife and helpful to those needing her assistance, as well as forthcoming with her personal religious understandings. [CLS] [SEP] Soon she was hosting women at her house weekly, providing commentary on recent sermons. [CLS] [SEP] These meetings became so popular that she began offering meetings for men as well, including the young governor of the colony, Henry Vane. [CLS] [SEP] Hutchinson began to accuse the local ministers (except for Cotton and her husband's brother-in-law, John Wheelwright) of preaching a covenant of works rather than a covenant of grace, and many ministers began to complain about her increasingly blatant accusations, as well as certain unorthodox theological teachings. [CLS] [SEP] The situation eventually erupted into what is commonly called the Antinomian Controversy, culminating in her 1637 trial, conviction, and banishment from the colony. [CLS] [SEP] This was followed by a March 1638 church trial in which she was put out of her congregation. [CLS] [SEP] Hutchinson and many of her supporters established the settlement of Portsmouth with encouragement from Providence Plantations founder Roger Williams in what became the Colony of Rhode Island and Providence Plantations. [CLS] [SEP] After her husband's death a few years later, threats of Massachusetts taking over Rhode Island compelled Hutchinson to move totally outside the reach of Boston into the lands of the Dutch. [CLS] [SEP] Five of her older surviving children remained in New England or in England, while she settled with her younger children near an ancient landmark, Split Rock, in what later became The Bronx in New York City. [CLS] [SEP] Tensions were high at the time with the Siwanoy Indian tribe. [CLS] [SEP] In August 1643, Hutchinson, six of her children, and other household members were massacred by Siwanoys during Kieft's War. [CLS] [SEP] The only survivor was her nine year-old daughter Susanna, who was taken captive. [CLS] [SEP] Hutchinson is a key figure in the history of religious freedom in England's American colonies and the history of women in ministry, challenging the authority of the ministers. [CLS] [SEP] She is honored by Massachusetts with a State House monument calling her a "courageous exponent of civil liberty and religious toleration". [CLS] [SEP] She has been called "the most famous—or infamous—English woman in colonial American history". [CLS] [SEP]
