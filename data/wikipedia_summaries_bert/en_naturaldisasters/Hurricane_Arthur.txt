[CLS] Hurricane Arthur was the earliest known hurricane annually to make landfall in the U.S. [SEP] [CLS] state of North Carolina, and the first hurricane to make landfall in the United States since Hurricane Isaac in 2012. [SEP] [CLS] The first named storm of the 2014 Atlantic hurricane season, Arthur developed from an initially non-tropical area of low pressure over the Southeastern United States that emerged into the western Atlantic Ocean on June 28. [SEP] [CLS] After sufficiently organizing, developing a well-defined circulation and deep convection amid a favorable environment, it was classified a tropical depression on July 1. [SEP] [CLS] The system continued to strengthen, and was declared a tropical storm later that day. [SEP] [CLS] Drifting northward, the storm reached hurricane status early on July 3 and curved toward the north-northeast. [SEP] [CLS] Further structural organization resulted in additional intensification, and by 01:00 UTC on July 4, the system attained its peak winds of 100 mph (155 km/h) as a Category 2 hurricane on the Saffirâ€“Simpson hurricane wind scale. [SEP] [CLS] Arthur made landfall at 03:15 UTC over North Carolina's Shackleford Banks, positioned between Cape Lookout and Beaufort, and intensified slightly further, with a minimum atmospheric pressure of 973 mbar (hPa; 28.70 inHg). [SEP] [CLS] The storm then trekked swiftly northeast, weakening as it passed by Cape Cod and Nantucket, before transitioning into an extratropical cyclone and coming ashore at Weymouth, Nova Scotia, on July 5. [SEP] [CLS] The remnants continued generally northeastward through Atlantic Canada before ultimately dissipating on July 9 over the Labrador Sea. [SEP] [CLS] Numerous tropical cyclone warnings and watches were issued for areas along the East Coast of the United States. [SEP] [CLS] A state of emergency was declared for 26 North Carolina counties, and both mandatory and voluntary evacuations were imposed along the state's coast. [SEP] [CLS] Several hundred government personnel were deployed to assist in evacuation and preparation efforts, along with heavy equipment capable of removing sand and debris. [SEP] [CLS] Due to the hurricane's timing, many Independence Day activities in the U.S. [SEP] [CLS] were cancelled or rescheduled. [SEP] [CLS] Damage was limited to strewn debris and inundated roads, and though 44,000 power outages were reported and widespread flooding occurred along northern sections of the coast, no deaths or serious injuries were reported. [SEP] [CLS] In New England, Arthur brought flash flooding and caused additional power outages, resulting in widespread road closures and suspension of ferry service. [SEP] [CLS] Losses in the country amounted to US$3.26 million. [SEP] [CLS] In Atlantic Canada and Quebec, hurricane-force gusts associated Arthur's remnants produced widespread damage. [SEP] [CLS] Countless trees and power lines fell across the region, leaving more than 300,000 without electricity. [SEP] [CLS] Damage to the power grid in Nova Scotia was regarded as the worst since Hurricane Juan in 2003. [SEP] [CLS] Efforts to restore and repair infrastructure were prolonged, with thousands still without power 10 days after the storm. [SEP] [CLS] Efforts to restore and repair damage to the electrical grid cost C$8.4 million (US$7.9 million). [SEP] [CLS] Reviews of Nova Scotia Power (NSP) and New Brunswick Power (NBP) were called upon due to numerous complaints from customers and politicians alike. [SEP] [CLS] A communication breakdown between NSP and the public exacerbated problems, and Nova Scotia Premier Stephen McNeil condemned the company's response as "inexcusable." Similarly severe impacts were felt by NBP which suffered a record-breaking C$23 million (US$21.6 million) in damage from the storm. [SEP] [CLS]
