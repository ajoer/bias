[CLS] The 2011-2012 El Hierro eruption occurred just off the island of El Hierro, the smallest and farthest south and west of the Canary Islands (an Autonomous Community of Spain), in the Atlantic Ocean off the coast of Africa. [SEP] [CLS] The island is also the youngest in the volcanic chain. [SEP] [CLS] The October 2011 - March 2012 eruption was underwater, with a fissure of vents located approximately 2 km to the south of the fishing village of La Restinga on the southern coast of the island. [SEP] [CLS] As of June 2012, increased seismicity to the north-west of the vent suggests another phase in the area's volcanic activity - comprising just deep-seated magma movements with associated earthquakes and deformation of the island at this June 2012 stage - is under way. [SEP] [CLS] A second phase of eruptive activity has not yet occurred, and it does not necessarily follow that it will occur. [SEP] [CLS]
