[CLS] Typhoon Omar of 1992, known in the Philippines as Typhoon Lusing, was the strongest and costliest typhoon to strike Guam since Typhoon Pamela in 1976. [SEP] [CLS] The cyclone formed on August 23 from the monsoon trough across the western Pacific Ocean. [SEP] [CLS] Moving westward, Omar slowly intensified into a tropical storm, although another tropical cyclone nearby initially impeded further strengthening. [SEP] [CLS] After the two storms became more distant, Omar quickly strengthened into a powerful typhoon. [SEP] [CLS] On August 28, it made landfall on Guam with winds of 195 km/h (120 mph). [SEP] [CLS] The typhoon reached its peak intensity the next day, with estimated 1‑minute winds of 240 km/h (150 mph), making it a "super typhoon" according to the Joint Typhoon Warning Center (JTWC). [SEP] [CLS] Omar weakened significantly before striking eastern Taiwan on September 4, proceeding into eastern China the next day and dissipating on September 9. [SEP] [CLS] On Guam, Omar caused one death and $457 million (1992 USD) in damage. [SEP] [CLS] Strong gusts up to 248 km/h (154 mph) left nearly the entire island without power for several days. [SEP] [CLS] The outages disrupted the water system and prevented the island-based JTWC from issuing advisories for 11 days. [SEP] [CLS] Omar damaged or destroyed 2,158 houses, leaving 3,000 people homeless. [SEP] [CLS] In response to the destruction, the island's building codes were updated to withstand winds of 250 km/h (155 mph), and insurance companies discontinued new policies for structures not made of concrete. [SEP] [CLS] While passing well north of the Philippines, the typhoon killed 11 people and wrought ₱903 million ($35.4 million) worth of damage to 538 houses. [SEP] [CLS] Omar then brushed the southern islands of Japan with strong gusts and light rainfall, causing ¥476 million JPY (US$3.8 million) in crop losses. [SEP] [CLS] In Taiwan, scattered flooding caused three deaths and $65 million in damage, mostly to agriculture. [SEP] [CLS]
