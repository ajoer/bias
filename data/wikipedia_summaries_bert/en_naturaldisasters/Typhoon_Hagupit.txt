Typhoon Hagupit (ha-gu-PIT, [hɐguˈpit]; Filipino word meaning "to lash" or "to flog"), known in the Philippines as Typhoon Ruby, was the second most intense tropical cyclone in 2014. [CLS] [SEP] Hagupit particularly impacted the Philippines in early December while gradually weakening, killing 18 people and causing $114 million (2014 USD) in the country. [CLS] [SEP] Prior to making landfall, Hagupit was considered the worst threat to the Philippines in 2014, but it was significantly smaller than 2013's Typhoon Haiyan.Hagupit developed into the 22nd tropical storm of the annual typhoon season on 1 December 2014 and became that year's eleventh typhoon the next day. [CLS] [SEP] Under a favorable environment, the typhoon underwent rapid deepening and reached peak intensity northwest of Palau on 4 December, with a clear eye. [CLS] [SEP] Hagupit slightly weakened but restrengthened on 5 December, but subsequently started to weaken again, due to subsidence associated with an upper-level trough.The typhoon made first landfall over the province of Eastern Samar in the Philippines on 6 December, and then made three other landfalls over the country. [CLS] [SEP] For land interaction and the slow movement, Hagupit weakened into a tropical storm on 8 December. [CLS] [SEP] When arriving at the South China Sea on 9 December, deep convection of the storm diminished significantly. [CLS] [SEP] The system could not overcome the hostile environment and weakened into a tropical depression on 11 December, before it eventually dissipated southeast of Ho Chi Minh City on 12 December.
