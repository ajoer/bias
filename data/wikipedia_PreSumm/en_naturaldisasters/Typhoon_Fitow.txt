[CLS] Typhoon Fitow, known in the Philippines as Typhoon Quedan, was the strongest typhoon to make landfall in Mainland China during October since 1949. [SEP] [CLS] The 21st named storm of the 2013 Pacific typhoon season, Fitow developed on September 29 to the east of the Philippines. [SEP] [CLS] It initially tracked north-northwestward, gradually intensifying into a tropical storm and later to typhoon status, or with winds of at least 120 km/h (75 mph). [SEP] [CLS] Fitow later turned more to the west-northwest due to an intensifying ridge to the east, bringing the typhoon over the Ryukyu Islands with peak winds of 140 km/h (85 mph) on October 5. [SEP] [CLS] The next day, the typhoon struck China at Fuding in Fujian province. [SEP] [CLS] Fitow quickly weakened over land, dissipating on October 7. [SEP] [CLS] Across its path, Fitow spurred many airlines to cancel flights and caused other transport disruptions. [SEP] [CLS] In Japan, the typhoon damaged 1,464 houses and left about 6,800 households without power on Miyako-jima. [SEP] [CLS] Heavy rainfall in Taiwan flooded houses and caused mudslides that closed two highways. [SEP] [CLS] Damage was heaviest in Fujian and Zhejiang provinces in China near where Fitow struck. [SEP] [CLS] In the latter province, rainfall peaked at 803 mm (31.6 in) in Yuyao, which flooded 70% of the town with up to 3 m (9.8 ft) of waters; as a result, the floods were the worst in a century for Yuyao, which disrupted aid distribution in the storm's aftermath. [SEP] [CLS] Across China, Fitow damaged about 95,000 houses and left at least 159,000 other houses without power. [SEP] [CLS] The storm also flooded about 75,000 hectares (185,000 acres) of fields and killed thousands of fish at fish farms. [SEP] [CLS] Total damage in the country reached ¥63.14 billion (2013 RMB, $10.4 billion USD), of which ¥6 billion (RMB, US$1 billion) was from insured losses, the second-costliest event on record. [SEP] [CLS] There were also 12 deaths in China, eight of them related to electrocutions. [SEP] [CLS]
