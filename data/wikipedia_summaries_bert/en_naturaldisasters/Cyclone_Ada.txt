Severe Tropical Cyclone Ada was a small but intense tropical cyclone that severely impacted the Whitsunday Region of Queensland, Australia, in January 1970. [CLS] [SEP] It has been described as a defining event in the history of the Whitsunday Islands, and was the most damaging storm in the mainland town of Proserpine's history at the time. [CLS] [SEP] Forming over the far eastern Coral Sea in early January, the weather disturbance that would become Ada remained weak and disorganised for nearly two weeks as it slowly moved in a clockwise loop. [CLS] [SEP] Accelerating toward the southwest, the system was named Ada on 15 January. [CLS] [SEP] All observations of the fledgling cyclone were made remotely with weather satellite imagery until it passed over an automated weather station on 16 January. [CLS] [SEP] The extremely compact cyclone, with a gale radius of just 55 km (35 mi), intensified into a Category 3 severe tropical cyclone just before striking the Whitsunday Islands at 14:00 UTC on 17 January. [CLS] [SEP] At 18:30 UTC, Ada's eye crossed the coast at Shute Harbour. [CLS] [SEP] The cyclone made little inland progress before stalling northwest of Mackay and dissipating on 19 January. [CLS] [SEP] Ada devastated several resort islands in the Whitsundays, in some cases destroying virtually all facilities and guest cabins. [CLS] [SEP] The biggest resort, located on Daydream Island, was obliterated, with similar destruction seen on South Molle, Hayman, and Long islands; since most boats docked on these islands were destroyed, hundreds of tourists in these resorts became stranded and required emergency rescue. [CLS] [SEP] Based on the severity of the damage, wind gusts were later estimated at 220 km/h (140 mph) . [CLS] [SEP] As Ada moved ashore, most homes were damaged or destroyed in communities near the storm's landfall point, including Cannonvale, Airlie Beach, and Shute Harbour. [CLS] [SEP] Extreme rainfall totals as high as 1,250 mm (49 in) caused massive river flooding in coastal waterways between Bowen and Mackay. [CLS] [SEP] The floodwaters washed out roads and left some locations isolated for days. [CLS] [SEP] Offshore, seven people were missing and presumed dead after their fishing trawler encountered the cyclone. [CLS] [SEP] Ada killed a total of 14 people, including 11 at sea, and caused A$12 million in damage. [CLS] [SEP] The cyclone revealed inadequacies in the warning broadcast system, and served as the impetus for enhanced cyclone awareness programs that have been credited with saving lives in subsequent cyclones. [CLS] [SEP] In January 2020, on the 50th anniversary of the disaster, a memorial to the storm victims was erected along the shoreline at Airlie Beach. [CLS] [SEP]
