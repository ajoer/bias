[CLS] Typhoon Sudal (pronounced [su.dal]), known in the Philippines as Typhoon Cosme, was the strongest typhoon to strike the island of Yap in the Federated States of Micronesia (FSM) in about 50 years. [SEP] [CLS] Yap is one of the four administrative divisions of the FSM. [SEP] [CLS] The entire island, only 17 km (11 mi) in length, experienced typhoon force winds, and 90% of the structures were damaged or destroyed. [SEP] [CLS] Damage was most severe in southeastern Yap, where the eyewall struck and winds exceeded 185 km/h (115 mph), but the center of the typhoon passed south of the island. [SEP] [CLS] Typhoon Sudal originally formed on April 2, 2004, out of a persistent area of convection east of the FSM. [SEP] [CLS] It moved mostly westward for the first week of its duration, with brief northerly and southwesterly turns. [SEP] [CLS] Sudal attained tropical storm status on April 5, and it gradually intensified into a typhoon, which is a tropical cyclone with winds of at least 119 km/h (74 mph) and is the equivalent of a hurricane in the Atlantic Ocean. [SEP] [CLS] On April 9, it passed just south of Yap, and shortly thereafter its peak winds were estimated at 240 km/h (150 mph). [SEP] [CLS] Later, Sudal moved to the northwest and eventually to the northeast, becoming an extratropical cyclone on April 16 and dissipating two days later. [SEP] [CLS] In addition to the damage on Yap, the typhoon dropped heavy rainfall in Chuuk in the Federated States of Micronesia, where some minor crop damage occurred. [SEP] [CLS] Sudal also brushed the United States islands of Guam and Rota with high waves and light rainfall, and later moved very close to the uninhabited Japanese island of Iwo Jima. [SEP] [CLS] Overall damage was $14 million (2004 USD, $16.1 million 2010 USD), most of which was on Yap, although no fatalities or serious injuries were reported. [SEP] [CLS] Due to the heavy damage, the name was retired and replaced with "Mirinae". [SEP] [CLS] The name "Sudal" was contributed by South Korea for the Pacific tropical cyclone list and is the Korean name for the otter. [SEP] [CLS]
