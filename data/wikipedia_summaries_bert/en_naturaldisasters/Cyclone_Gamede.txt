[CLS] Cyclone Gamede was among the wettest tropical cyclones on record, dropping more than 5.5 m (18 ft) of rain in a nine-day period on Réunion island in the southwest Indian Ocean. [SEP] [CLS] The seventh named storm of the 2006–07 South-West Indian Ocean cyclone season, Gamede formed south of Diego Garcia on February 19 as a tropical disturbance. [SEP] [CLS] It tracked generally westward and steadily intensified, reaching tropical cyclone status on February 23. [SEP] [CLS] For two days, Gamede stalled northwest of the Mascarene Islands as an intense tropical cyclone, during which it reached 10 minute maximum sustained winds of winds of 165 km/h (105 mph), according to the Météo-France meteorological office in Réunion (MFR). [SEP] [CLS] The American-based Joint Typhoon Warning Center (JTWC) estimated peak 1 minute winds of 195 km/h (120 mph), equivalent to a Category 3 on the Saffir-Simpson scale. [SEP] [CLS] For four days, Gamede remained within 400 km (250 mi) of Réunion before accelerating southward. [SEP] [CLS] On March 2, Gamede transitioned into an extratropical cyclone to the southeast of Madagascar. [SEP] [CLS] The MFR tracked the storm for four more days. [SEP] [CLS] Cyclone Gamede first passed near St. [SEP] [CLS] Brandon, where its 160 km/h (99 mph) wind gusts damaged a few windows. [SEP] [CLS] When the storm stalled for a few days, it resulted in a prolonged period of heavy rainfall and high tides for the Mascarene Islands. [SEP] [CLS] A pluviometer at Commerson Crater recorded worldwide record rainfall amounts over a period of 3–9 days, with a total of 5512 mm (217 in). [SEP] [CLS] Only Cyclone Hyacinthe in 1980 had a higher recorded rainfall total. [SEP] [CLS] The deluge from Gamede caused flooding damage across Réunion, washing out a bridge in the southern portion of the island. [SEP] [CLS] Monetary damage on Réunion was estimated at over €165 million (US$120 million). [SEP] [CLS] Two people each were killed on Réunion and nearby Mauritius. [SEP] [CLS] The storm's outer rainbands affected southeastern Madagascar, becoming the fourth tropical cyclone to affect the country in two months. [SEP] [CLS] Later, high waves from Gamede flooded coastal portions of the South African province of KwaZulu-Natal. [SEP] [CLS]
