Jean Joseph Étienne Lenoir also known as Jean J. [CLS] [SEP] Lenoir (12 January 1822 – 4 August 1900) was a Belgian engineer who developed the internal combustion engine in 1858. [CLS] [SEP] Prior designs for such engines were patented as early as 1807 (De Rivaz engine), but none were commercially successful. [CLS] [SEP] Lenoir's engine was commercialized in sufficient quantities to be considered a success, a first for the internal combustion engine. [CLS] [SEP] He was born in Mussy-la-Ville (then in Luxembourg, part of the Belgian Province of Luxembourg since 1839). [CLS] [SEP] In 1838, he emigrated to France, taking up residence in Paris, where he developed an interest in electroplating. [CLS] [SEP] His interest in the subject led him to make several electrical inventions, including an improved electric telegraph. [CLS] [SEP]
