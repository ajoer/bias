[CLS] Severe Tropical Cyclone Daman (RSMC Nadi designation 04F, JTWC designation 05P) was the strongest cyclone of the 2007–08 South Pacific cyclone season. [SEP] [CLS] Cyclone Daman was the fourth tropical depression and the first severe tropical cyclone to form east of longitude 180° during the 2007–08 South Pacific cyclone season. [SEP] [CLS] Due to the severity of the storm, the name Daman was retired and replaced with Denia. [SEP] [CLS] On December 3, the Regional Specialized Meteorological Centre (RSMC) in Nadi, Fiji, upgraded a tropical disturbance, located to the west of the Solomon Islands, to Tropical Depression 04F. [SEP] [CLS] On December 5, as the depression moved towards the west into the Fijian archipelago, both the Joint Typhoon Warning Center (JTWC) and RSMC Nadi upgraded it to Cyclone Daman. [SEP] [CLS] On December 7 the cyclone reached its peak intensity with winds of 185 km/h, (115 mph 10-minute sustained) which made Daman a Category 4 cyclone on the Australian Tropical Cyclone Intensity Scale. [SEP] [CLS] Later that day Daman also reached its peak intensity by 1-minute means with winds of 205 km/h (125 mph) which made it a Category 3 tropical cyclone on the Saffir-Simpson Hurricane Scale. [SEP] [CLS] Early on December 8, Cyclone Daman brushed by the Fijian island of Cikobia, causing damage to housing, crops and vegetation. [SEP] [CLS] Daman then weakened the next day into a tropical depression and dissipated on December 10. [SEP] [CLS]
