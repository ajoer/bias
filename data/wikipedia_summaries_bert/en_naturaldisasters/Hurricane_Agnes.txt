Hurricane Agnes was the costliest hurricane to hit the United States at the time, causing an estimated $2.1 billion in damage. [CLS] [SEP] The hurricane's death toll was 128. [CLS] [SEP] The effects of Agnes were widespread, from the Caribbean to Canada, with much of the east coast of the United States affected. [CLS] [SEP] Damage was heaviest in Pennsylvania, where Agnes was the state's wettest tropical cyclone. [CLS] [SEP] Due to the significant effects, the name Agnes was retired in the spring of 1973. [CLS] [SEP] Agnes was the second tropical cyclone and first named storm of the 1972 Atlantic hurricane season. [CLS] [SEP] It developed as a tropical depression on June 14 from the interaction of a polar front and an upper trough over the Yucatán Peninsula. [CLS] [SEP] The storm emerged into the western Caribbean Sea on June 15, and strengthened into Tropical Storm Agnes the next day. [CLS] [SEP] Thereafter, Agnes slowly curved northward and passed just west of Cuba on June 17. [CLS] [SEP] Early on June 18, the storm intensified enough to be upgraded to Hurricane Agnes. [CLS] [SEP] Heading northward, the hurricane eventually made landfall near Panama City, Florida, late on June 19. [CLS] [SEP] After moving inland, Agnes rapidly weakened and was only a tropical depression when it entered Georgia. [CLS] [SEP] The weakening trend halted as the storm crossed over Georgia and into South Carolina. [CLS] [SEP] While over eastern North Carolina, Agnes re-strengthened into a tropical storm on June 21, as a result of baroclinic activity. [CLS] [SEP] Early the following day, the storm emerged into the Atlantic Ocean before re-curving northwestward and making landfall near New York City as a strong tropical storm. [CLS] [SEP] Agnes quickly became an extratropical cyclone on June 23, and tracked to the northwest of Great Britain, before being absorbed by another extratropical cyclone on July 6. [CLS] [SEP] Though it moved slowly across the Yucatán Peninsula, the damage Agnes caused in Mexico is unknown. [CLS] [SEP] Although the storm bypassed the tip of Cuba, heavy rainfall occurred, killing seven people. [CLS] [SEP] In Florida, Agnes caused a significant tornado outbreak, with at least 26 confirmed twisters, two of which were spawned in Georgia. [CLS] [SEP] The tornadoes and two initially unconfirmed tornadoes in Florida alone resulted in over $4.5 million (1972 USD) in damage and six fatalities. [CLS] [SEP] At least 2,082 structures in Florida suffered either major damage or were destroyed. [CLS] [SEP] About 1,355 other dwellings experienced minor losses. [CLS] [SEP] Though Agnes made landfall as a hurricane, no hurricane-force winds were reported. [CLS] [SEP] Along the coast abnormally high tides resulted in extensive damage, especially between Apalachicola and Cedar Key. [CLS] [SEP] Light to moderate rainfall was reported in Florida, though no significant flooding occurred. [CLS] [SEP] In Georgia, damage was limited to two tornadoes, which caused approximately $275,000 in losses. [CLS] [SEP] Minimal effects were also recorded in Alabama, Connecticut, Delaware, Rhode Island, South Carolina, and Tennessee; though one fatality was reported in Delaware. [CLS] [SEP] The most significant effects, by far, occurred in Pennsylvania, mostly due to intense flooding. [CLS] [SEP] The hurricane severely flooded the Susquehanna River and the Lackawanna River causing major damage to the Wilkes-Barre/Scranton metropolitan area. [CLS] [SEP] In both Pennsylvania and New Jersey combined, about 43,594 structures were either destroyed or significantly damaged. [CLS] [SEP] In Canada, a mobile home was toppled, killing two people.
