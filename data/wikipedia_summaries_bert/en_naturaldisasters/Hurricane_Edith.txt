Hurricane Edith was the strongest hurricane to form during the 1971 Atlantic hurricane season and formerly the southernmost landfalling Category 5 hurricane on record in the Atlantic until 2007. [CLS] [SEP] Edith also stands as one of the only Category 5 Atlantic hurricanes to not have its name retired, next to 1953's Hurricane Carol and 2005's Hurricane Emily. [CLS] [SEP] Edith developed from a tropical wave on September 5 and quickly strengthened into a hurricane in the Caribbean Sea. [CLS] [SEP] Edith rapidly intensified on September 9 and made landfall on Cape Gracias a Dios as a Category 5 hurricane on the Saffir-Simpson Hurricane Scale. [CLS] [SEP] It quickly lost intensity over Central America and after briefly entering the Gulf of Honduras it crossed the Yucat√°n Peninsula in Mexico. [CLS] [SEP] After moving across the Gulf of Mexico a trough turned the storm to the northeast and Edith, after having restrengthened while accelerating towards the coast, made landfall on Louisiana with winds of 105 mph (170 km/h) on September 16. [CLS] [SEP] Edith steadily weakened over land and dissipated over Georgia on September 18. [CLS] [SEP] The hurricane killed two people when it passed near Aruba. [CLS] [SEP] Striking northeastern Central America as a Category 5 hurricane, Edith destroyed hundreds of homes and killed at least 35 people. [CLS] [SEP] In Texas high tides caused coastal flooding but little damage. [CLS] [SEP] Edith caused moderate to heavy damage in portions of Louisiana due to flooding and a tornado outbreak from the storm. [CLS] [SEP] One tornado, rated F3 on the Fujita Scale, damaged several homes and injured multiple people in Baton Rouge. [CLS] [SEP] The tornado outbreak extended eastward into Florida, of which a few destroyed entire buildings.
