[CLS] The 1994 Northridge earthquake was a moment magnitude 6.7 (Mw), blind thrust earthquake that occurred on January 17, 1994, at 4:30:55 a.m. [SEP] [CLS] PST in the San Fernando Valley region of the County of Los Angeles. [SEP] [CLS] Its epicenter was in Reseda, a neighborhood in the north-central area of the San Fernando Valley. [SEP] [CLS] The quake had a duration of approximately 10–20 seconds, and its peak ground acceleration of 1.82 g0 (17.8 m/s2) was the highest ever instrumentally recorded in an urban area in North America. [SEP] [CLS] Strong ground motion was felt as far away as Las Vegas, Nevada, about 220 miles (350 km) from the epicenter. [SEP] [CLS] The peak ground velocity at the Rinaldi Receiving Station was 183 centimetres per second (4.1 mph; 6.6 km/h), the fastest ever recorded. [SEP] [CLS] Two 6.0 Mw aftershocks followed, the first about one minute after the initial event and the second approximately 11 hours later, the strongest of several thousand aftershocks in all. [SEP] [CLS] The death toll was 57, with more than 8,700 injured. [SEP] [CLS] In addition, property damage was estimated to be $13–50 billion (equivalent to $22–86 billion in 2014), making it one of the costliest natural disasters in U.S. [SEP] [CLS] history.
