[CLS] Greta Garbo (born Greta Lovisa Gustafsson; 18 September 1905 – 15 April 1990) was a Swedish-American actress. [SEP] [CLS] Regarded as one of the greatest actresses of all time, Garbo was known for her melancholy, somber persona due to her many portrayals of tragic characters in her films and for her subtle and understated performances. [SEP] [CLS] In 1999, the American Film Institute ranked Garbo fifth on its list of the greatest female stars of classic Hollywood cinema. [SEP] [CLS] Garbo launched her career with a secondary role in the 1924 Swedish film The Saga of Gösta Berling. [SEP] [CLS] Her performance caught the attention of Louis B. [SEP] [CLS] Mayer, chief executive of Metro-Goldwyn-Mayer (MGM), who brought her to Hollywood in 1925. [SEP] [CLS] She stirred interest with her first American silent film, Torrent (1926). [SEP] [CLS] Garbo’s performance in Flesh and the Devil (1927), her third movie, made her an international star.Garbo's first sound film was Anna Christie (1930).

[SEP] [CLS] For her performances in these films, she received her first of the three nominations for the Academy Award for Best Actress. [SEP] [CLS] In 1932, her success allowed her to dictate the terms of her contract, and she became increasingly selective about her roles. [SEP] [CLS] She continued in films such as Mata Hari (1931), Inspiration (1931), Grand Hotel (1932), Queen Christina (1933), and Anna Karenina (1935).
