[CLS] Typhoon Herb, known in the Philippines as Typhoon Huaning, was the strongest and the largest storm of 1996. [SEP] [CLS] Herb struck the Ryūkyū Islands, Taiwan and the People's Republic of China, causing major damage. [SEP] [CLS] The name Herb was used in the Western Pacific name list for the first time after the list had been revised earlier in 1996. [SEP] [CLS] Although the name was not retired, the Western Pacific name list was changed from English names to Asian names in 2000, so 1996 was in fact the only occasion when the name was used (it was never used in the Atlantic Ocean or the Eastern Pacific.)
