Hurricane Luis was a very large, long-lived, powerful and a very destructive Category 4 Cape Verde hurricane, as well as one of the strongest and most notable hurricanes of the 1995 Atlantic hurricane season. [CLS] [SEP] Luis was also the strongest hurricane to make landfall, and the third-most intense hurricane recorded during the extremely active season. [CLS] [SEP] It was the twelfth tropical storm, sixth hurricane, and second major hurricane of the season. [CLS] [SEP] At one point, the storm was one of four simultaneous tropical systems in the Atlantic basin, along with Humberto, Iris, and Karen. [CLS] [SEP] The storm lasted for 14 days as a tropical storm between late August and mid-September. [CLS] [SEP] Luis caused extensive damage in Antigua and St. [CLS] [SEP] Barthelemy and catastrophic damage in Barbuda, most area on St Martin and Anguilla as a Category 4 with winds between 130 mph (210 km/h) and 135 mph (217 km/h). [CLS] [SEP] The storm accounted for 19 deaths, left over 70,000 disaster victims and near 20,000 homeless (mostly in Anguilla, Barbuda and Saint Martin) and caused roughly $3.3 billion (1995 USD) in damage across the affected areas. [CLS] [SEP] At this time, Luis was the costliest and most devastating hurricane to strike the Leeward Islands and since the 1950, it was the last Category 4 storms to hit the Leeward Islands in the 20th century after Hurricane Dog in 1950, Hurricane Donna in 1960, Hurricane David in 1979 and Hurricane Hugo in 1989. [CLS] [SEP] Additionally, Luis was the second of three tropical cyclones to affect Guadeloupe in a short period of time, the first being Hurricane Iris a week before, and the last being Hurricane Marilyn only ten days afterward. [CLS] [SEP] During the next year, the Leeward Islands would be struck by Hurricane Bertha, while still repairing from Luis and Marilyn, then successively hit by Hortense, Erika, Georges, Jose, Lenny and Debby. [CLS] [SEP] The system formed from a tropical wave south of Cape Verde islands, west of Africa on August 27, then subsequently attained tropical storm status on August 29. [CLS] [SEP] Two days later, the storm reached hurricane status; shortly thereafter, it rapidly strengthened into a 140 mph (220 km/h) Category 4 hurricane. [CLS] [SEP] At this strength, Luis affected much of the Leeward Islands on September 4 to September 6. [CLS] [SEP] Throughout the following days, Luis gradually weakened as it accelerated safely to the west of Bermuda. [CLS] [SEP] As a Category 1 hurricane, Luis made landfall on Newfoundland before it became extratropical on September 11. [CLS] [SEP] Shortly before becoming extratropical, the hurricane-force radius wind field of Luis was the largest ever observed and measured for an Atlantic hurricane until 2019.Luis was also responsible for an intense rogue wave which struck RMS Queen Elizabeth 2 on September 11, though the ship pulled through with little damage.
