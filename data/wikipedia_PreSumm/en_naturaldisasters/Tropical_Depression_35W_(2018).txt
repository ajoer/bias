[CLS] The 2018 Pacific typhoon season was at the time, the costliest Pacific typhoon season on record, until the record was beaten by the following year. [SEP] [CLS] The season was above-average, producing 29 storms, 13 typhoons, and 7 super typhoons. [SEP] [CLS] It was an event in the annual cycle of tropical cyclone formation, in which tropical cyclones form in the western Pacific Ocean. [SEP] [CLS] The season ran throughout 2018, though most tropical cyclones typically develop between May and October. [SEP] [CLS] The season's first named storm, Bolaven, developed on January 3, while the season's last named storm, Man-yi, dissipated on November 28. [SEP] [CLS] The season's first typhoon, Jelawat, reached typhoon status on March 29, and became the first super typhoon of the year on the next day. [SEP] [CLS] The scope of this article is limited to the Pacific Ocean, to the north of the equator between 100°E and the 180th meridian. [SEP] [CLS] Within the northwestern Pacific Ocean, there are two separate agencies that assign names to tropical cyclones, which can often result in a cyclone having two names, one from the JMA and one from PAGASA. [SEP] [CLS] The Japan Meteorological Agency (JMA) will name a tropical cyclone should it be judged to have 10-minute sustained wind speeds of at least 65 km/h (40 mph) anywhere in the basin, while the Philippine Atmospheric, Geophysical and Astronomical Services Administration (PAGASA) assigns names to tropical cyclones which move into or form as a tropical depression in their area of responsibility located between 135°E and 115°E and between 5°N–25°N regardless of whether or not a tropical cyclone has already been given a name by the JMA. [SEP] [CLS] Tropical depressions that are monitored by the United States' Joint Typhoon Warning Center (JTWC) are given a number with a "W" suffix. [SEP] [CLS]
