[CLS] Johannes Brahms (German: [joˈhanəs ˈbʁaːms]; 7 May 1833 – 3 April 1897) was a German composer, pianist, and conductor of the Romantic period. [SEP] [CLS] Born in Hamburg into a Lutheran family, Brahms spent much of his professional life in Vienna. [SEP] [CLS] His reputation and status as a composer are such that he is sometimes grouped with Johann Sebastian Bach and Ludwig van Beethoven as one of the "Three Bs" of music, a comment originally made by the nineteenth-century conductor Hans von Bülow. [SEP] [CLS] Brahms composed for symphony orchestra, chamber ensembles, piano, organ, and voice and chorus. [SEP] [CLS] A virtuoso pianist, he premiered many of his own works. [SEP] [CLS] He worked with some of the leading performers of his time, including the pianist Clara Schumann and the violinist Joseph Joachim (the three were close friends). [SEP] [CLS] Many of his works have become staples of the modern concert repertoire. [SEP] [CLS] An uncompromising perfectionist, Brahms destroyed some of his works and left others unpublished. [SEP] [CLS] Brahms has been considered, by his contemporaries and by later writers, as both a traditionalist and an innovator. [SEP] [CLS] His music is firmly rooted in the structures and compositional techniques of the Classical masters. [SEP] [CLS] While many contemporaries found his music too academic, his contribution and craftsmanship have been admired by subsequent figures as diverse as Arnold Schoenberg and Edward Elgar. [SEP] [CLS] The diligent, highly constructed nature of Brahms's works was a starting point and an inspiration for a generation of composers. [SEP] [CLS] Embedded within his meticulous structures, however, are deeply romantic motifs. [SEP] [CLS]
