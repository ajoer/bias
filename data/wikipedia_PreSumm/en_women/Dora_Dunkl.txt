[CLS] Provenance in geology, is the reconstruction of the origin of sediments. [SEP] [CLS] The Earth is a dynamic planet, and all rocks are subject to transition between the three main rock types: sedimentary, metamorphic, and igneous rocks (the rock cycle). [SEP] [CLS] Rocks exposed to the surface are sooner or later broken down into sediments. [SEP] [CLS] Sediments are expected to be able to provide evidence of the erosional history of their parent source rocks. [SEP] [CLS] The purpose of provenance study is to restore the tectonic, paleo-geographic and paleo-climatic history. [SEP] [CLS] In the modern geological lexicon, "sediment provenance" specifically refers to the application of compositional analyses to determine the origin of sediments. [SEP] [CLS] This is often used in conjunction with the study of exhumation histories, interpretation of drainage networks and their evolution, and forward-modelling of paleo-earth systems. [SEP] [CLS] In combination, these help to characterise the "source to sink" journey of clastic sediments from hinterland to sedimentary basin. [SEP] [CLS]
