[CLS] The 2004 Pacific typhoon season was a very active season; it ran year-round in 2004, but most tropical cyclones tend to form in the northwestern Pacific Ocean between May and November. [SEP] [CLS] These dates conventionally delimit the period of each year when most tropical cyclones form in the northwestern Pacific Ocean. [SEP] [CLS] The scope of this article is limited to the Pacific Ocean, north of the equator and west of the International Date Line. [SEP] [CLS] Storms that form east of the date line and north of the equator are called hurricanes; see 2004 Pacific hurricane season. [SEP] [CLS] All tropical storms that develop in the western Pacific Ocean are assigned a name by the Japan Meteorological Agency (JMA). [SEP] [CLS] Tropical depressions in this basin have a "W" suffix added to their number by the Joint Typhoon Warning Center (JTWC). [SEP] [CLS] Tropical depressions that enter or form in the Philippine area of responsibility are assigned a name by the Philippine Atmospheric, Geophysical and Astronomical Services Administration (PAGASA). [SEP] [CLS] This can often result in the same storm having two names. [SEP] [CLS] The 2004 season was a very active season. [SEP] [CLS] Of the 29 storms named in this year, 19 reached typhoon intensity. [SEP] [CLS] The accumulated cyclone energy (ACE) index of this season amounted to 60% above the normal level for Pacific typhoon seasons, at 480. [SEP] [CLS] This makes 2004 season the third most active season in recorded history, only after 1997 and 1992. [SEP] [CLS]
