Bernadette Soubirous (, French: [bɛʁnadɛt subiʁu]; Occitan: Bernadeta Sobirós [beɾnaˈðetɔ suβiˈɾus]; 7 January 1844 – 16 April 1879), also known as Saint Bernadette of Lourdes, was the firstborn daughter of a miller from Lourdes (Lorda in Occitan), in the department of Hautes-Pyrénées in France, and is best known for experiencing Marian apparitions of a "young lady" who asked for a chapel to be built at the nearby cave-grotto at Massabielle. [CLS] [SEP] These apparitions are said to have occurred between 11 February and 16 July 1858, and the woman who appeared to her identified herself as the "Immaculate Conception." Despite initial skepticism from some Catholic Church authorities, Soubirous's claims were eventually declared "worthy of belief" after a canonical investigation, and the Marian apparition became known as Our Lady of Lourdes. [CLS] [SEP] Since her death, Soubirous's body has apparently remained internally incorrupt. [CLS] [SEP] The Marian shrine at Lourdes (Midi-Pyrénées, from 2016 part of Occitanie) went on to become a major pilgrimage site, attracting over five million pilgrims of all denominations each year. [CLS] [SEP] On 8 December 1933, Pope Pius XI, declared Soubirous a saint of the Catholic Church. [CLS] [SEP] Her feast day, initially specified as 18 February – the day Mary promised to make her happy, not in this life, but in the next – is now observed in most places on the date of her death, 16 April.
