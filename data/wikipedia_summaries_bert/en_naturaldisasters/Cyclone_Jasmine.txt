Severe Tropical Cyclone Jasmine (RSMC Nadi designation: 12F, JTWC designation: 10P) was a powerful and long-lived annular tropical cyclone that affected several countries, particularly Vanuatu and Tonga, over a 16-day span in February 2012. [CLS] [SEP] The system was the second cyclone and the only severe tropical cyclone of the relatively quiet 2011–12 South Pacific cyclone season. [CLS] [SEP] Cyclone Jasmine developed from an area of disturbed weather on 1 February in the Gulf of Carpentaria. [CLS] [SEP] Initially, the storm moved towards the east and across the Cape York Peninsula. [CLS] [SEP] As it moved across the South Pacific, earlier existing wind shear conditions lessened, and Jasmine began to strengthen at a faster rate. [CLS] [SEP] Steadily intensifying, Jasmine reached peak intensity on 8 February as a Category 4 equivalent on the Saffir–Simpson Hurricane Scale, while beginning to show annular characteristics. [CLS] [SEP] The next day Jasmine entered an area of vertical wind shear, which consequently weakened the cyclone and caused its eye to expand. [CLS] [SEP] A high-pressure area south of Jasmine later steered the weakening cyclone to the northeast on 12 February. [CLS] [SEP] Although it entered an area of warmer sea surface temperatures, Jasmine subsequently entered extratropical transition and later degenerated into an extratropical cyclone on 16 February, and later dissipated completely on 19 February. [CLS] [SEP] Cyclone Jasmine affected five countries during its existence. [CLS] [SEP] The predecessor to Jasmine brought heavy rainfall to areas of extreme northern Queensland. [CLS] [SEP] Jasmine also brought rainfall to areas of the Solomon Islands. [CLS] [SEP] As a result, pest infestations occurred across the region. [CLS] [SEP] In Vanuatu, heavy rains and wind from Jasmine destroy numerous crops. [CLS] [SEP] Banana trees in particular are affected by the cyclone. [CLS] [SEP] Jasmine inundated areas of Tonga that had already been affected by Cyclone Cyril just a week prior. [CLS] [SEP] Nuku'alofa recorded half of its average monthly rainfall in a 24‑hour span due to rains associated with the cyclone. [CLS] [SEP] After the season, the name Jasmine was retired from the Australian list of tropical cyclone names. [CLS] [SEP]
