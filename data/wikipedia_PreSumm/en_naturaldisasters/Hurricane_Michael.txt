[CLS] Hurricane Michael was a very powerful and destructive tropical cyclone that became the first Category 5 hurricane to strike the contiguous United States since Andrew in 1992. [SEP] [CLS] In addition, it was the third-most intense Atlantic hurricane to make landfall in the contiguous United States in terms of pressure, behind the 1935 Labor Day hurricane and Hurricane Camille in 1969. [SEP] [CLS] It was the first Category 5 hurricane on record to impact the Florida Panhandle, the fourth-strongest landfalling hurricane in the contiguous United States, in terms of wind speed, and was the most intense hurricane on record to strike the United States in the month of October. [SEP] [CLS] The thirteenth named storm, seventh hurricane, and second major hurricane of the 2018 Atlantic hurricane season, Michael originated from a broad low-pressure area that formed in the southwestern Caribbean Sea on October 1. [SEP] [CLS] The disturbance became a tropical depression on October 7, after nearly a week of slow development. [SEP] [CLS] By the next day, Michael had intensified into a hurricane near the western tip of Cuba, as it moved northward. [SEP] [CLS] The hurricane rapidly intensified in the Gulf of Mexico, reaching major hurricane status on October 9. [SEP] [CLS] As it approached the Florida Panhandle, Michael reached Category 5 status with peak winds of 160 mph (260 km/h) just before making landfall near Mexico Beach, Florida, on October 10, becoming the first to do so in the region as a Category 5 hurricane, and as the strongest storm of the season. [SEP] [CLS] As it moved inland, the storm weakened and began to take a northeastward trajectory toward Chesapeake Bay, downgrading to a tropical storm over Georgia, and transitioning into an extratropical cyclone over southern Virginia late on October 11. [SEP] [CLS] Michael subsequently strengthened into a powerful extratropical cyclone and eventually impacted the Iberian Peninsula, before dissipating on October 16. [SEP] [CLS] At least 74 deaths were attributed to the storm, including 59 in the United States and 15 in Central America. [SEP] [CLS] Michael caused an estimated $25.1 billion (2018 USD) in damages, including $100 million in economic losses in Central America, damage to U.S. [SEP] [CLS] fighter jets with a replacement cost of approximately $6 billion at Tyndall Air Force Base, and at least $6.23 billion in insurance claims in the U.S. [SEP] [CLS] Losses to agriculture alone exceeded $3.87 billion. [SEP] [CLS] As a tropical disturbance, the system caused extensive flooding in Central America in concert with a second disturbance over the eastern Pacific Ocean. [SEP] [CLS] In Cuba, the hurricane's winds left over 200,000 people without power as the storm passed to the island's west. [SEP] [CLS] Along the Florida panhandle, the cities of Mexico Beach and Panama City suffered the worst of Michael, with catastrophic damage reported due to the extreme winds and storm surge. [SEP] [CLS] Numerous homes were flattened and trees felled over a wide swath of the panhandle. [SEP] [CLS] A maximum wind gust of 139 mph (224 km/h) was measured at Tyndall Air Force Base before the sensors failed. [SEP] [CLS] As Michael tracked across the Southeastern United States, strong winds caused extensive power outages across the region. [SEP] [CLS]
