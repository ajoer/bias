[CLS] Clarence Thomas (born June 23, 1948) is an Associate Justice of the Supreme Court of the United States. [SEP] [CLS] He was nominated by President George H. [SEP] [CLS] W. [SEP] [CLS] Bush on July 1, 1991, to succeed Thurgood Marshall and is the second African American to serve on the Court. [SEP] [CLS] Thomas's service began October 23, 1991. [SEP] [CLS] Upon the retirement of Anthony Kennedy in 2018, Thomas became the most senior member of the Supreme Court, that is, the longest-serving current Justice, with a tenure of 28 years, 300 days as of August 18, 2020. [SEP] [CLS] Thomas grew up in Savannah, Georgia, and was educated at the College of the Holy Cross and at Yale Law School. [SEP] [CLS] He was appointed an Assistant Attorney General in Missouri in 1974, and subsequently practiced law there in the private sector. [SEP] [CLS] In 1979, he became a legislative assistant to United States Senator John Danforth, and in 1981 was appointed Assistant Secretary for Civil Rights at the U.S. [SEP] [CLS] Department of Education. [SEP] [CLS] In 1982, President Ronald Reagan appointed Thomas Chairman of the Equal Employment Opportunity Commission (EEOC). [SEP] [CLS] In 1990, President George H. [SEP] [CLS] W. [SEP] [CLS] Bush nominated Thomas for a seat on the United States Court of Appeals for the District of Columbia Circuit. [SEP] [CLS] He served in that role for 16 months, and on July 1, 1991, was nominated by Bush to fill Marshall's seat on the U.S. [SEP] [CLS] Supreme Court. [SEP] [CLS] Thomas's confirmation hearings were bitter and intensely fought, centering on an accusation that he had sexually harassed attorney Anita Hill, a subordinate at the Department of Education and subsequently at the EEOC. [SEP] [CLS] Hill claimed that Thomas had repeatedly made sexual and romantic overtures to her, despite her repeatedly rebuffing him and telling him to stop; Thomas and his supporters claimed that Hill, witnesses who came forward on her behalf, and her supporters had fabricated the allegations to prevent a black conservative from getting a seat on the Supreme Court. [SEP] [CLS] The U.S. [SEP] [CLS] Senate ultimately confirmed Thomas by a vote of 52â€“48.Since joining the court, Thomas has taken a textualist approach, seeking to uphold the original meaning of the United States Constitution and statutes. [SEP] [CLS] He is also, along with fellow justice Neil Gorsuch, an advocate of natural law jurisprudence. [SEP] [CLS] Thomas is generally viewed as the most conservative member of the court. [SEP] [CLS] Thomas is also known for almost never speaking during oral arguments. [SEP] [CLS]
