[CLS] The Great Hurricane of 1780, also known as Huracán San Calixto, the Great Hurricane of the Antilles, and the 1780 Disaster, is the deadliest Atlantic hurricane on record. [SEP] [CLS] Between 22,000 and 27,501 people died throughout the Lesser Antilles when the storm passed through them from October 10–16. [SEP] [CLS] Specifics on the hurricane's track and strength are unknown because the official Atlantic hurricane database goes back only to 1851.The hurricane struck Barbados likely as a Category 5 hurricane, with at least one estimate of wind speeds as high as 200 mph (320 km/h) (greater than any in recorded Atlantic basin history) before moving past Martinique, Saint Lucia, and Sint Eustatius, and causing thousands of deaths on those islands. [SEP] [CLS] Coming in the midst of the American Revolution, the storm caused heavy losses to the British fleet contesting for control of the area, largely weakening British control over the Atlantic. [SEP] [CLS] The hurricane later passed near Puerto Rico and over the eastern portion of Hispaniola, causing heavy damage near the coastlines. [SEP] [CLS] It ultimately turned to the northeast and was last observed on October 20 southeast of Atlantic Canada. [SEP] [CLS] The death toll from the Great Hurricane alone exceeds that of many entire decades of Atlantic hurricanes. [SEP] [CLS] Estimates are marginally higher than for Hurricane Mitch, the second-deadliest Atlantic storm, for which figures are likely more accurate. [SEP] [CLS] The hurricane was part of the disastrous 1780 Atlantic hurricane season, with two other deadly storms occurring in October. [SEP] [CLS]
