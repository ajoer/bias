[CLS] [SEP] He moved to California in the early 1920s and set up the Disney Brothers Studio with his brother Roy. [CLS] [SEP] With Ub Iwerks, Walt developed the character Mickey Mouse in 1928, his first highly popular success; he also provided the voice for his creation in the early years. [CLS] [SEP] As the studio grew, Disney became more adventurous, introducing synchronized sound, full-color three-strip Technicolor, feature-length cartoons and technical developments in cameras. [CLS] [SEP] The results, seen in features such as Snow White and the Seven Dwarfs (1937), Pinocchio, Fantasia (both 1940), Dumbo (1941), and Bambi (1942), furthered the development of animated film. [CLS] [SEP] New animated and live-action films followed after World War II, including the critically successful Cinderella (1950) and Mary Poppins (1964), the latter of which received five Academy Awards. [CLS] [SEP] In the 1950s, Disney expanded into the amusement park industry, and in 1955 he opened Disneyland in Anaheim, California. [CLS] [SEP] To fund the project he diversified into television programs, such as Walt Disney's Disneyland and The Mickey Mouse Club; he was also involved in planning the 1959 Moscow Fair, the 1960 Winter Olympics, and the 1964 New York World's Fair. [CLS] [SEP] In 1965, he began development of another theme park, Disney World, the heart of which was to be a new type of city, the "Experimental Prototype Community of Tomorrow" (EPCOT). [CLS] [SEP] Disney was a heavy smoker throughout his life and died of lung cancer in December 1966 before either the park or the EPCOT project were completed. [CLS] [SEP] Disney was a shy, self-deprecating and insecure man in private but adopted a warm and outgoing public persona. [CLS] [SEP] He had high standards and high expectations of those with whom he worked. [CLS] [SEP] Although there have been accusations that he was racist or anti-Semitic, they have been contradicted by many who knew him. [CLS] [SEP] His reputation changed in the years after his death, from a purveyor of homely patriotic values to a representative of American imperialism. [CLS] [SEP] He nevertheless remains an important figure in the history of animation and in the cultural history of the United States, where he is considered a national cultural icon. [CLS] [SEP] His film work continues to be shown and adapted; his namesake studio and company maintains high standards in its production of popular entertainment, and the Disney amusement parks have grown in size and number to attract visitors in several countries.
