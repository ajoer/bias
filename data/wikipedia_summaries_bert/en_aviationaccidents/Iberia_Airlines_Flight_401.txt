[CLS] Iberia Airlines Flight 401 was a routine flight from Madrid International Airport in Spain to Los Rodeos Airport in Tenerife. [SEP] [CLS] The aircraft had first entered service with Iberia new in 1954 and was named "Santa Maria". [SEP] [CLS] There was heavy fog at around 21:17 (9:17 p.m.) local time. [SEP] [CLS] As the plane came in on final approach, fog started to settle in and blocked view of the runway, and the approach controller informed the crew that visibility was below minimal. [SEP] [CLS] The pilot made a very low run and initiated a go-around and made another approach to land. [SEP] [CLS] He got a view of the beginning of the runway, but not the rest of the runway and decided to go around at about 1,000 ft (305 m). [SEP] [CLS] As he applied full power, the aircraft struck a scraper, a tractor and a minivan about 50 meters (164 feet) from the runway centerline. [SEP] [CLS] The plane was damaged and could not gain altitude, causing it to crash in the Los Rodeos gorge besides the runway. [SEP] [CLS] The post-accident investigation faulted the pilot for not diverting to Las Palmas. [SEP] [CLS]
