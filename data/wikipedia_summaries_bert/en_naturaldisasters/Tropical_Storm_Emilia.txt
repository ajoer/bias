[CLS] The 1988 Pacific hurricane season was a Pacific hurricane season that saw a below-average amount of tropical cyclones form, the first time since 1981. [SEP] [CLS] It officially began May 15, in the eastern Pacific, and June 1, in the central Pacific and lasted until November 30. [SEP] [CLS] These dates conventionally delimit the period of each year when most tropical cyclones form in the northeastern Pacific Ocean. [SEP] [CLS] The first named storm, Tropical Storm Aletta, formed on June 16, and the last-named storm, Tropical Storm Miriam, was previously named Hurricane Joan in the Atlantic Ocean before crossing Central America and re-emerging in the eastern Pacific; Miriam continued westward and dissipated on November 2. [SEP] [CLS] The season produced 23 tropical depressions, of which 15 attained tropical storm status. [SEP] [CLS] Seven storms reached hurricane status, three of which became major hurricanes. [SEP] [CLS] The strongest storm of the season, Hurricane Hector, formed on July 30 to the south of Mexico and reached peak winds of 145 mph (230 km/h)—Category 4 status—before dissipating over open waters on August 9; Hector was never a threat to land. [SEP] [CLS] Tropical Storm Gilma was the only cyclone in the season to make landfall, crossing the Hawaiian Islands, although there were numerous near-misses. [SEP] [CLS] Gilma's Hawaiian landfall was unusual, but not unprecedented. [SEP] [CLS] There were also two systems that successfully crossed over from the Atlantic; the aforementioned Hurricane Joan and Hurricane Debby which became Tropical Storm Miriam and Tropical Depression Seventeen-E, respectively. [SEP] [CLS] Three systems caused deaths; Tropical Storm Aletta caused one death in southwestern Mexico, Hurricane Uleki caused two drownings off the coast of Oahu as it passed by the Hawaiian Islands, and Hurricane Kristy caused 21 deaths in the Mexican states of Oaxaca and Chipas.
