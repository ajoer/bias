Rishabhanatha (also Ṛṣabhadeva, Rishabhadeva, or Ṛṣabha) is the first Tīrthaṅkara (lit. [CLS] [SEP] 'ford-maker') of Jainism. [CLS] [SEP] He was the first of twenty-four teachers in the present half-cycle of time in Jain cosmology, and called a "ford maker" because his teachings helped one across the sea of interminable rebirths and deaths. [CLS] [SEP] Jain legends depict him as having lived millions of years ago. [CLS] [SEP] He is also known as Ādinātha which translates into "First (Adi) Lord (nātha)", as well as Adishvara (first ishvara), Yugadideva (deva of yuga), Prathamaraja (first king), and Nabheya (son of Nabhi). [CLS] [SEP] Along with Mahavira, Parshvanatha and Neminatha, Rishabhanatha is one of the four Tirthankaras that attract the most devotional worship among the Jains.According to Jain traditional accounts, he was born to king Nabhi and queen Marudevi in the north Indian city of Ayodhya, also called Vinita. [CLS] [SEP] He had two wives, Sunanda and Sumangala. [CLS] [SEP] Sumangala is described as the mother of his ninety-nine sons (including Bharata) and one daughter, Brahmi. [CLS] [SEP] Sunanda is depicted as the mother of Bahubali and Sundari. [CLS] [SEP] The sudden death of Nilanjana, one of the dancers of Indra, reminded him of the world's transitory nature, and he developed a desire for renunciation. [CLS] [SEP] After his renunciation, the Jain legends state Rishabhanatha wandered without food for an entire year. [CLS] [SEP] The day on which he got his first ahara (food) is celebrated by Jains as Akshaya Tritiya. [CLS] [SEP] He attained Moksha on Mount Asthapada (Kailash). [CLS] [SEP] The text Adi Purana by Jinasena is an account of the events of his life.
