[CLS] Southern Ontario's worst tornado outbreak of the decade came on Saturday, April 20, 1996. [SEP] [CLS] Severe weather had raked parts of the U.S. [SEP] [CLS] Midwest the day before, where seventeen F2 or greater tornadoes touched down (ten in Illinois alone). [SEP] [CLS] A cold front was being dragged eastward into unusually warm and unstable air associated with a strong storm system moving through the northern tier of the U.S. [SEP] [CLS] Out of the two significant tornadoes that day, both rated F3, it was remarkable that no lives were lost. [SEP] [CLS] Nine people escaped with minor injuries. [SEP] [CLS] Many homes were severely damaged in Williamsford, Arthur, and Violet Hill. [SEP] [CLS] Many areas that experienced the tornadoes on May 31, 1985 were hit once again, especially the Grand Valley area. [SEP] [CLS] The first tornado that touched down tore a 40 kilometre long path southeast of Owen Sound. [SEP] [CLS] A second tornado touched down farther south and took a 60 kilometre track from Arthur to just southwest of Barrie. [SEP] [CLS] There was a third brief touchdown near Orillia associated with the parent storm of the second tornado. [SEP] [CLS]
