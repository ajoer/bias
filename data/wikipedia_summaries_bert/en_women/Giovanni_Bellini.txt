Giovanni Bellini (Italian pronunciation: [dʒoˈvanni belˈliːni]; c. [CLS] [SEP] 1430 – 26 November 1516) was an Italian Renaissance painter, probably the best known of the Bellini family of Venetian painters. [CLS] [SEP] His father was Jacopo Bellini, his brother was Gentile Bellini (who was more highly regarded than Giovanni during his lifetime, although the reverse is true today), and his brother-in-law was Andrea Mantegna. [CLS] [SEP] He was considered to have revolutionized Venetian painting, moving it towards a more sensuous and colouristic style. [CLS] [SEP] Through the use of clear, slow-drying oil paints, Giovanni created deep, rich tints and detailed shadings. [CLS] [SEP] His sumptuous coloring and fluent, atmospheric landscapes had a great effect on the Venetian painting school, especially on his pupils Giorgione and Titian. [CLS] [SEP]
