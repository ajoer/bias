Tropical Storm Gordon was a tropical cyclone of moderate intensity that caused damage along the Gulf Coast of the United States in early September 2018. [CLS] [SEP] The seventh named storm of the 2018 Atlantic hurricane season, Gordon developed from a tropical wave that was first monitored in the Caribbean Sea on August 30. [CLS] [SEP] The wave moved west-northwestward toward the east coast of Florida while gradually organizing. [CLS] [SEP] The disturbance was marked as Potential Tropical Cyclone Seven on September 2 while near the Bahamas, and early the next day, it became Tropical Storm Gordon. [CLS] [SEP] The system made landfall on the southwest coast of Florida shortly afterwards. [CLS] [SEP] Steady intensification began after it moved off the coast of Florida and into the Gulf of Mexico. [CLS] [SEP] Gordon reached its peak intensity as a high-end tropical storm late on September 4 before making landfall just east of Pascagoula, Mississippi shortly afterwards. [CLS] [SEP] Gordon then rapidly weakened as it tacked inland, and degenerated into a remnant low on September 6. [CLS] [SEP] Gordon's remnants lingered over Arkansas for two days, before opening up into a low-pressure trough on September 8. [CLS] [SEP] At least three deaths were attributed to the storm, and Gordon caused approximately $200â€“250 million (2018 USD) in damages, making it the third-costliest tropical cyclone in the United States for the 2018 season.
