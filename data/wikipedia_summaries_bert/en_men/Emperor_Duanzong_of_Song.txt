[CLS] Emperor Duanzong of Song (10 July 1269 – 8 May 1278), personal name Zhao Shi, was the 17th emperor of the Song dynasty in China and the eighth and penultimate emperor of the Southern Song dynasty. [SEP] [CLS] He was the fifth son of Emperor Duzong and an elder brother of his predecessor, Emperor Gong and successor Zhao Bing. [SEP] [CLS] Emperor Gong along with Grand Dowager Xie surrendered to the Mongol Empire in 1276 after the fall of the Song capital, Lin'an (present-day Hangzhou). [SEP] [CLS] Zhao Shi and his seventh brother, Zhao Bing, managed to escape southward to Fujian Province, where the new Song capital was established. [SEP] [CLS] On June 14, 1276, Zhao Shi was enthroned as the new Emperor Duanzong who ruled under the era name "Jingyan" (景炎; literally: "bright flame"). [SEP] [CLS] However, in early 1278, the Mongols broke through the Song dynasty's last lines of defence, forcing Zhao Shi to flee again. [SEP] [CLS] Accompanied by loyal ministers such as Lu Xiufu and Zhang Shijie, Zhao Shi boarded a ship and fled further south to Guangdong Province. [SEP] [CLS] In March 1278, while fleeing from the Mongols led by Liu Shen, in a hurricane, Zhao Shi fell from a boat and almost drowned. [SEP] [CLS] Thereafter, he stayed temporarily in Hong Kong which at that time was a small fishing village. [SEP] [CLS] He died a few months later in Gangzhou (碙州; present-day Mui Wo, Lantau Island, Hong Kong) due to Illness. [SEP] [CLS] He was succeeded by his seventh brother, Zhao Bing, who was enthroned in Mui Wo, the same village where Zhao Shi nearly drowned and died. [SEP] [CLS] The historical relic Sung Wong Toi in present-day Hong Kong's Kowloon City commemorates Zhao Shi's escape to Hong Kong. [SEP] [CLS]
