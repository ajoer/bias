Japan Airlines Flight 123 was a scheduled domestic Japan Airlines passenger flight from Tokyo's Haneda Airport to Osaka International Airport, Japan. [CLS] [SEP] On August 12, 1985, a Boeing 747SR operating this route suffered a sudden decompression twelve minutes into the flight and crashed in the area of Mount Takamagahara, Ueno, Gunma Prefecture, 100 kilometres (62 miles; 54 nautical miles) from Tokyo thirty-two minutes later. [CLS] [SEP] The crash site was on Osutaka Ridge, near Mount Osutaka. [CLS] [SEP] Japan's Aircraft Accident Investigation Commission officially concluded that the rapid decompression was caused by a faulty repair by Boeing technicians after a tailstrike incident during a landing at Osaka Airport in 1978. [CLS] [SEP] The rear bulkhead of the plane had been repaired with an improperly installed doubler plate, compromising the plane's airworthiness. [CLS] [SEP] Cabin pressurization continued to expand and contract the improperly repaired bulkhead until the day of the accident, when the faulty repair failed, causing a rapid decompression that ripped off a large portion of the tail and caused the loss of hydraulic controls to the entire plane. [CLS] [SEP] The aircraft, configured with increased economy class seating, was carrying 524 people. [CLS] [SEP] Casualties of the crash included all 15 crew members and 505 of the 509 passengers. [CLS] [SEP] Some of the passengers survived the initial crash but subsequently died of their injuries hours later while awaiting rescue. [CLS] [SEP] It is the deadliest single-aircraft accident in aviation history. [CLS] [SEP]
