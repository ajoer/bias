The 1935 Jérémie hurricane, commonly referred to as the 1935 Haiti hurricane, was a highly destructive and catastrophic tropical cyclone that impacted the Greater Antilles and Honduras in October 1935, killing well over 2,000 people. [CLS] [SEP] Developing on October 18 over the southwestern Caribbean Sea, the storm proceeded to strike eastern Jamaica and southeastern Cuba while overwhelming southwestern Haiti in a deluge of rain. [CLS] [SEP] The hurricane—a Category 1 at its peak—completed an unusual reversal of its path on October 23, heading southwestward toward Central America. [CLS] [SEP] Weakened by its interaction with Cuba, the storm soon regained strength and made its final landfall near Cabo Gracias a Dios in Honduras on October 25. [CLS] [SEP] The cyclone weakened upon moving inland and dissipated two days later. [CLS] [SEP] Flooding and landslides in Jamaica took their toll on property, agricultural interests, and infrastructure; fruit growers on the island sustained about $2.5 million (1935 USD) in losses. [CLS] [SEP] Just off the coast, an unidentified vessel went down with her entire crew in the hostile conditions. [CLS] [SEP] Strong winds buffeted coastal sections of Cuba, notably in and around Santiago de Cuba. [CLS] [SEP] There, the hurricane demolished 100 homes and filled streets with debris. [CLS] [SEP] Only four people died in the country, thanks to the extensive pre-storm preparations. [CLS] [SEP] The storm did the most damage along the Tiburon Peninsula of southwestern Haiti, where catastrophic river flooding took the lives of up to 2,000 individuals, razed hundreds of native houses, and destroyed crops and livestock. [CLS] [SEP] The heaviest destruction took place around the towns of Jacmel and Jérémie; one early report estimated that 1,500 had been killed at the latter. [CLS] [SEP] Entire swaths of countryside were isolated for days, delaying both reconnaissance and relief efforts. [CLS] [SEP] The hurricane later created devastating floods in Central America, chiefly in Honduras. [CLS] [SEP] Reported at the time to be the worst flood in the nation's history, the disaster decimated banana plantations and population centers after rivers flowed up to 50 ft (15 m) above normal. [CLS] [SEP] Torrents of floodwaters trapped hundreds of citizens in trees, on rooftops, and on remote high ground, requiring emergency rescue. [CLS] [SEP] The storm left thousands homeless and around 150 dead in the country, while monetary losses totaled $12 million. [CLS] [SEP] Flooding and strong winds reached into northeastern Nicaragua, though damage was much less widespread than in neighboring Honduras. [CLS] [SEP]
