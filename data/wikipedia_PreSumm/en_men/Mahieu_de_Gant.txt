[CLS] Mahieu de Gant (fl. [SEP] [CLS] mid–late 13th century) was a Flemish trouvère (composer) from Ghent associated with the so-called "school of Arras". [SEP] [CLS] He has been conflated with Mahieu le Juif, but the same manuscript containing both their works clearly distinguishes them. [SEP] [CLS] His career can only be dated because of those with whom he composed jeux partis, which includes Robert de la Piere, who died in 1258. [SEP] [CLS] All of Mahieu's melodies are in bar form.
