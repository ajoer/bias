[CLS] Robert Schumann (German: [ˈʃuːman]; 8 June 1810 – 29 July 1856) was a German composer, pianist, and influential music critic. [SEP] [CLS] He is widely regarded as one of the greatest composers of the Romantic era. [SEP] [CLS] Schumann left the study of law, intending to pursue a career as a virtuoso pianist. [SEP] [CLS] His teacher, Friedrich Wieck, a German pianist, had assured him that he could become the finest pianist in Europe, but a hand injury ended this dream. [SEP] [CLS] Schumann then focused his musical energies on composing. [SEP] [CLS] In 1840, after a long and acrimonious legal battle with Wieck, who opposed the marriage, Schumann married Wieck's daughter Clara. [SEP] [CLS] A lifelong partnership in music began, as Clara herself was an established pianist and music prodigy. [SEP] [CLS] Clara and Robert also maintained a close relationship with German composer Johannes Brahms. [SEP] [CLS] Until 1840, Schumann wrote exclusively for the piano. [SEP] [CLS] Later, he composed piano and orchestral works, and many Lieder (songs for voice and piano). [SEP] [CLS] He composed four symphonies, one opera, and other orchestral, choral, and chamber works. [SEP] [CLS] His best-known works include Carnaval, Symphonic Studies, Kinderszenen, Kreisleriana, and the Fantasie in C. [SEP] [CLS] Schumann was known for infusing his music with characters through motifs, as well as references to works of literature. [SEP] [CLS] These characters bled into his editorial writing in the Neue Zeitschrift für Musik (New Journal for Music), a Leipzig-based publication that he co-founded. [SEP] [CLS] Schumann suffered from a mental disorder that first manifested in 1833 as a severe melancholic depressive episode—which recurred several times alternating with phases of "exaltation" and increasingly also delusional ideas of being poisoned or threatened with metallic items. [SEP] [CLS] What is now thought to have been a combination of bipolar disorder and perhaps mercury poisoning led to "manic" and "depressive" periods in Schumann's compositional productivity. [SEP] [CLS] After a suicide attempt in 1854, Schumann was admitted at his own request to a mental asylum in Endenich near Bonn. [SEP] [CLS] Diagnosed with psychotic melancholia, he died of pneumonia two years later at the age of 46, without recovering from his mental illness. [SEP] [CLS]
