[CLS] The 1955 Atlantic hurricane season was, at the time, the costliest season ever recorded. [SEP] [CLS] The hurricane season officially began on June 15, 1955, and ended on November 15, 1955. [SEP] [CLS] It was slightly above average, with 13 recorded tropical cyclones. [SEP] [CLS] The first storm, Alice, had persisted since December 30, 1954. [SEP] [CLS] Alice caused relatively minor impact as it tracked through the Lesser Antilles and eastern Caribbean Sea in early January. [SEP] [CLS] Tropical Storm Brenda caused two deaths and minor damage along the Gulf Coast of the United States in early August. [SEP] [CLS] The quick succession of Hurricanes Connie and Diane caused significant flooding in the Northeastern United States, with nearly $1 billion (1955 USD) in losses and at least 232 fatalities. [SEP] [CLS] The next three storms – Hurricanes Edith and Flora and Tropical Storm Five – caused very minor or no impact. [SEP] [CLS] In early August, Hurricane Gladys caused severe localized flooding in Mexico, primarily in Mexico City. [SEP] [CLS] Additionally, an offshoot of Gladys inflicted minor impact in Texas. [SEP] [CLS] Hurricane Hilda struck the Greater Antilles and then Mexico. [SEP] [CLS] It was attributed to at least 304 deaths and $120 million in losses. [SEP] [CLS] In mid-September, Hurricane Ione struck eastern North Carolina and contributed the flooding from Connie and Diane, resulting in seven fatalities and $88 million in damage. [SEP] [CLS] Later that month, Hurricane Janet, which peaked as a Category 5 hurricane, lashed several countries adjacent to the Caribbean Sea, as well as Mexico and British Honduras. [SEP] [CLS] Janet resulted in $53.8 million in damage and at least 716 deaths. [SEP] [CLS] An unnamed tropical storm in the month of October did not impact land. [SEP] [CLS] Hurricane Katie, the final storm, caused minor damage in a sparsely populated area of Hispaniola, totaling to at least $200,000; 7 fatalities were also reported. [SEP] [CLS] Collectively, the storms caused 1518 deaths and $1.2 billion in losses, making it the costliest season at the time. [SEP] [CLS] A record number of names – four – were retired following the season, which was later tied by the 1995, 2004, and 2017 seasons, trailing only the 2005 season, when five names were retired.
