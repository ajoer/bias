[CLS] The 1912 Jamaica hurricane was a slow-moving tropical cyclone that meandered about the island of Jamaica, causing torrential rainfall and severe flooding in November 1912. [SEP] [CLS] The strongest hurricane in the Atlantic that year, the cyclone formed from a low pressure area in the southwestern Caribbean Sea early on November 11. [SEP] [CLS] Initially, the storm tracked slowly to northwest, before eventually curving north-northeastward. [SEP] [CLS] Late on November 13, the cyclone became a hurricane. [SEP] [CLS] After reaching hurricane status, further deepening was slow, though after recurving toward northeastward, the storm began to quicken its rate of intensification. [SEP] [CLS] Early on November 17, the system peaked as a 115 mph (185 km/h) Category 3 hurricane on the modern day Saffir–Simpson hurricane wind scale. [SEP] [CLS] It continued north-northeastward and made landfall near Negril, Jamaica, on November 18. [SEP] [CLS] The storm weakened continually after landfall and reentry into the Caribbean Sea. [SEP] [CLS] On November 20, the hurricane weakened to a tropical storm north of Jamaica. [SEP] [CLS] The system tracked westward across the Caribbean, before dissipating on November 22 to the southwest of Grand Cayman. [SEP] [CLS] Heavy rainfall was reported in Jamaica, with as much as 36 inches (910 mm) of precipitation recorded in some areas. [SEP] [CLS] Several bridges were severely damaged in the northern and eastern portions of the island. [SEP] [CLS] Strong winds generated by the storm destroyed approximately 25% of banana trees, while telegraph lines were downed in a number of places. [SEP] [CLS] Railway lines were also heavily damaged by the winds and rain. [SEP] [CLS] Rough seas also lashed the island, with Savanna-la-Mar suffering near complete destruction and 42 deaths in that city alone. [SEP] [CLS] Across western Jamaica, roughly a hundred homes were destroyed, while 5,000 buildings were damaged or demolished. [SEP] [CLS] About 100 fatalities and $1.5 million (1912 USD) in damage occurred in Jamaica. [SEP] [CLS] Extensive flooding and five fatalities occurred in Cuba in the Guantánamo Bay area.
