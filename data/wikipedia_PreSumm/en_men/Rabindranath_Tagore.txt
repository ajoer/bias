[CLS] Rabindranath Tagore ( (listen); born Robindronath Thakur, 7 May 1861 – 7 August 1941), sobriquets Gurudev, was a Bengali poet, writer, composer, and painter. [SEP] [CLS] He reshaped Bengali literature and music, as well as Indian art with Contextual Modernism in the late 19th and early 20th centuries. [SEP] [CLS] Author of the "profoundly sensitive, fresh and beautiful verse" of Gitanjali, he became in 1913 the first non-European to win the Nobel Prize in Literature. [SEP] [CLS] Tagore's poetic songs were viewed as spiritual and mercurial; however, his "elegant prose and magical poetry" remain largely unknown outside Bengal. [SEP] [CLS] He is sometimes referred to as "the Bard of Bengal".A Bengali Brahmin from Calcutta with ancestral gentry roots in Burdwan district and Jessore, Tagore wrote poetry as an eight-year-old. [SEP] [CLS] At the age of sixteen, he released his first substantial poems under the pseudonym Bhānusiṃha ("Sun Lion"), which were seized upon by literary authorities as long-lost classics. [SEP] [CLS] By 1877 he graduated to his first short stories and dramas, published under his real name. [SEP] [CLS] As a humanist, universalist, internationalist, and ardent anti-nationalist, he denounced the British Raj and advocated independence from Britain. [SEP] [CLS] As an exponent of the Bengal Renaissance, he advanced a vast canon that comprised paintings, sketches and doodles, hundreds of texts, and some two thousand songs; his legacy also endures in the institution he founded, Visva-Bharati University.Tagore modernised Bengali art by spurning rigid classical forms and resisting linguistic strictures. [SEP] [CLS] His novels, stories, songs, dance-dramas, and essays spoke to topics political and personal. [SEP] [CLS] Gitanjali (Song Offerings), Gora (Fair-Faced) and Ghare-Baire (The Home and the World) are his best-known works, and his verse, short stories, and novels were acclaimed—or panned—for their lyricism, colloquialism, naturalism, and unnatural contemplation. [SEP] [CLS] His compositions were chosen by two nations as national anthems: India's "Jana Gana Mana" and Bangladesh's "Amar Shonar Bangla". [SEP] [CLS] The Sri Lankan national anthem was inspired by his work. [SEP] [CLS]
