Tropical Cyclone Tam (RSMC Nadi designation: 04F, JTWC designation: 06P) was the first named storm of the 2005–06 South Pacific cyclone season. [CLS] [SEP] Forming out of a tropical depression on January 6, the storm gradually intensified, becoming a tropical cyclone on January 12 and receiving the name Tam. [CLS] [SEP] Although it was traveling at a quick pace, the storm gained organization and reached its peak intensity with winds of 85 km/h (50 mph) the following day. [CLS] [SEP] However, the increasing forward motion of the storm, combined with strengthening wind shear, caused Tam to rapidly weaken on January 14. [CLS] [SEP] Around that time, it entered the Tropical Cyclone Warning Centre in Wellington, New Zealand's area of responsibility. [CLS] [SEP] Shortly thereafter, the storm transitioned into an extratropical cyclone and dissipated early the next day. [CLS] [SEP] Cyclone Tam produced heavy rainfall and strong winds over American Samoa upon being named. [CLS] [SEP] The precipitation caused several mudslides and flooding, which inflicted $26,000 in damage. [CLS] [SEP] The storm also had minor effects on Niue, Tonga, and Futuna. [CLS] [SEP]
