[CLS] Tropical Storm Flossie yielded stormy weather to Hawaii in late July 2013. [SEP] [CLS] The sixth tropical cyclone and named storm of the annual hurricane season, Flossie originated from a tropical wave that emerged off the western coast of Africa on July 9. [SEP] [CLS] Tracking westward across the Atlantic with little development, it passed over Central America and into the eastern Pacific Ocean on July 18, where favorable environmental conditions promoted steady organization. [SEP] [CLS] By 0600 UTC on July 25, the wave acquired enough organization to be deemed a tropical depression; it intensified into a tropical storm six hours later. [SEP] [CLS] Continuing westward, Flossie attained peak winds of 70 mph (110 km/h) on July 27 before entering the central Pacific Ocean. [SEP] [CLS] There, unfavorable upper-level winds established a weakening trend; on July 30, Flossie weakened to a tropical depression, and by 1200 UTC that same day, the storm degenerated into a remnant low, northeast of Kauai. [SEP] [CLS] In advance of Flossie, tropical cyclone warnings and watches were placed into effect for various Hawaiian Islands. [SEP] [CLS] In addition, numerous flash flood watches were issued in fear of over a foot of precipitation. [SEP] [CLS] Ports and numerous facilities were closed to the public, and authorities opened shelters for refuge. [SEP] [CLS] Upon approach, Flossie threatened to become the first tropical storm to make a direct hit on Hawaii in two decades; however, the system weakened prior to doing so. [SEP] [CLS] Flossie brought high surf to the state, leading to minor beach erosion. [SEP] [CLS] Gusty winds exceeded tropical storm threshold, downing numerous power poles and trees; as a result, several thousand locals were without power for a few days. [SEP] [CLS] The storm produced several inches of rainfall across the island, with a peak of 9.27 in (235 mm) on Mount Waialeale. [SEP] [CLS] Though one man was injured due to lightnings, no fatalities were reported in association with Flossie. [SEP] [CLS] Damage totaled to $24,000 (2013 USD) as a consequence of lightning.
