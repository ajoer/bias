Anna Nahowski (1860–1931) was the mistress of Franz Joseph of Austria from 1875 until 1889. [CLS] [SEP] She was from the age of fourteen married to the silk manufacturer Heuduck, who was heavily indebted by gambling and alcoholism. [CLS] [SEP] She met Franz Joseph at a walk in the park of Schönbrunn. [CLS] [SEP] The relationship was arranged between Anna and Franz Joseph without the knowledge of her spouse. [CLS] [SEP] Franz Joseph visited her discreetly and regularly while her husband (whose debts were paid) was away. [CLS] [SEP] This arrangement continued also after she remarried the decadent Franz Nahowski.
