[CLS] Severe Tropical Cyclone Tessi was a small but potent tropical cyclone that caused extensive damage along the coast of North Queensland in early April 2000. [SEP] [CLS] The ninth cyclone and fourth severe tropical cyclone of the 1999â€“2000 Australian region cyclone season, Tessi developed on 1 April from a persistent trough of low pressure in the Coral Sea and slowly tracked west-southwestward. [SEP] [CLS] Tessi was an unusually compact storm that strengthened rapidly just before landfall, peaking as a Category 3 severe tropical cyclone on the Australian tropical cyclone intensity scale with 10-minute average maximum winds of 140 km/h (85 mph). [SEP] [CLS] Around 22:00 UTC on 2 April, Tessi moved ashore about 75 km (45 mi) northwest of Townsville and rapidly diminished as it progressed inland. [SEP] [CLS] At the height of the storm, Magnetic Island experienced sustained winds of 109 km/h (68 mph), while gusts as high as 130 km/h (81 mph) were recorded in Townsville. [SEP] [CLS] Tessi's strong winds caused widespread damage along the coast from Ingham to Ayr, most notably around Townsville, where many trees were uprooted and 50,000 homes lost electricity. [SEP] [CLS] Buildings and vehicles were damaged by the winds and fallen trees, and roadways surrounding the city became impassable. [SEP] [CLS] Torrential rains, amounting to 423.4 mm (16.67 in) in just 24 hours, saturated a hillside in Castle Hill and caused a large landslide. [SEP] [CLS] Hundreds of Castle Hill residents were forced to leave their homes, and many structures were inundated with mud and debris. [SEP] [CLS] The landslide dislodged a large boulder uphill from several residences, creating a period of local concern before workers stabilised the slope. [SEP] [CLS] Along the coast, the storm wrecked boats and eroded beaches. [SEP] [CLS] Total damage in Townsville was estimated to be at least $50 million (2000 AUD), and the name Tessi was later retired due to the cyclone's impacts. [SEP] [CLS]
