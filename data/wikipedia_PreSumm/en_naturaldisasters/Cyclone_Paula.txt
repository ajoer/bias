[CLS] Severe Tropical Cyclone Paula (RSMC Nadi designation: 09F, JTWC designation: 13P) was a tropical cyclone which caused extensive damage to areas of Vanuatu. [SEP] [CLS] The cyclone was the second cyclone and only severe tropical cyclone of the relatively inactive 2000â€“01 South Pacific cyclone season. [SEP] [CLS] Cyclone Paula developed from an area of disturbed weather embedded within a monsoon trough on February 25, 2001, near Vanuatu. [SEP] [CLS] Situated in an area of favorable conditions, Paula steadily intensified as it moved in a general direction towards the southeast. [SEP] [CLS] On March 1, Paula reached peak intensity with winds of 175 km/h (109 mph), sustained for ten minutes. [SEP] [CLS] However, the cyclone began to accelerate further to the southeast into more unfavorable conditions. [SEP] [CLS] As a result, Paula quickly weakened, and thus degenerated into an extratropical cyclone on March 4. [SEP] [CLS]
