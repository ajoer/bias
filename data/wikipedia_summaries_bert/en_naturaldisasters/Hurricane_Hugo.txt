Hurricane Hugo was a powerful Cape Verde tropical cyclone that inflicted widespread damage across the northeastern Caribbean and the Southeastern United States in September 1989. [CLS] [SEP] Across its trek, Hugo affected approximately 2 million people. [CLS] [SEP] Its direct effects killed 67 people and inflicted $11 billion in damage. [CLS] [SEP] The damage wrought by the storm was more costly than any Atlantic hurricane preceding it. [CLS] [SEP] At its peak strength east of the Lesser Antilles, Hugo was classified as a Category 5 hurricane—the highest rating on the Saffir–Simpson scale. [CLS] [SEP] Over the course of five days, Hugo made landfalls on Guadeloupe, Saint Croix, Puerto Rico, and South Carolina, bringing major hurricane conditions to these and surrounding areas. [CLS] [SEP] Lesser effects were felt along the periphery of the hurricane's path in the Lesser Antilles and across the Eastern United States into Eastern Canada. [CLS] [SEP] The scale of Hugo's impacts led to the retirement of the name Hugo from Atlantic hurricane names. [CLS] [SEP] Hugo arose from a cluster of thunderstorms near Cape Verde on September 10, 1989. [CLS] [SEP] This cluster coalesced into a tropical depression and strengthened into a tropical storm—named Hugo—as it tracked west for several days. [CLS] [SEP] On September 13, Hugo became a hurricane and continued to intensify until its winds topped out at Category 5 strength with speeds of 160 mph (260 km/h). [CLS] [SEP] At the time, Hugo was the easternmost Category 5 on record in the Atlantic. [CLS] [SEP] Between September 17–18, Hugo moved across the northeastern Caribbean as a slightly weaker system before emerging into the Sargasso Sea. [CLS] [SEP] Changes in broader weather patterns caused Hugo to take an accelerated northwestward trajectory towards the Southeastern U.S., culminating in Hugo's landfall on Sullivan's Island, South Carolina, as a Category 4 hurricane on September 22. [CLS] [SEP] The storm weakened inland and accelerated north, transitioning into an extratropical cyclone on September 23 before it was last noted in the far northern Atlantic on September 25. [CLS] [SEP] Hurricane watches and warnings were issued by the National Hurricane Center for areas in Hugo's path from September 15–22; several hundred thousand people from the Caribbean to the continental U.S. [CLS] [SEP] would evacuate to safety. [CLS] [SEP] Hugo was the strongest hurricane to strike the northeastern Caribbean since 1979. [CLS] [SEP] The hurricane proved to be among the most destructive storms in history for several islands in the region. [CLS] [SEP] Guadeloupe bore the brunt of the storm in the Leeward Islands, sustaining damage to the entirety of its banana crop and most of its coconut palms and sugar cane crop. [CLS] [SEP] Three thousand houses were unroofed, contributing to the displacement of 35,000 people from their homes. [CLS] [SEP] Hugo was Montserrat's costliest hurricane on record and brought down the island's entire power grid. [CLS] [SEP] Ninety percent of homes on the island suffered significant to total roof loss after the island was struck by the eyewall. [CLS] [SEP] The hurricane's impacts continued into the Virgin Islands and Puerto Rico, causing over $1 billion in damage. [CLS] [SEP] Wind gusts up to 168 mph (270 km/h) were measured in Saint Croix, where property damage exceeded $500 million with over 90 percent of buildings damaged; three people were killed on the island. [CLS] [SEP] Widespread damage occurred in Puerto Rico and much of the island suffered power and water service failures. [CLS] [SEP] Eight people were killed in Puerto Rico and nearly 28,000 people were left homeless. [CLS] [SEP] Hugo was the strongest hurricane to landfall on the continental U.S. [CLS] [SEP] in two decades. [CLS] [SEP] Along the coast of South Carolina, Hugo set new records for storm surge heights along the U.S. [CLS] [SEP] East Coast, reaching 20.2 ft (6.2 m) near McClellanville, South Carolina. [CLS] [SEP] The surge and winds wrought extensive damage across South Carolina's barrier islands, destroying many beachfront homes and other coastal installations. [CLS] [SEP] Hugo's northward acceleration at landfall led to unusually large and significant impacts to forests between South Carolina and Virginia, inflicting further damage to property; in South Carolina alone the loss of timber was estimated at $1.04 billion. [CLS] [SEP] Flood and wind impacts followed Hugo across much of the eastern United States and into eastern Canada. [CLS] [SEP] The cleanup and recovery efforts that followed were extensive throughout the areas affected by Hugo. [CLS] [SEP] There were at least 39 fatalities during the post-storm recovery phase; more people died in South Carolina in the hurricane's aftermath than during its passage. [CLS] [SEP] American troops were deployed in Saint Croix to quell pervasive looting that began amid Hugo's devastation—this was the first deployment of the American military in response to a domestic crisis since 1968. [CLS] [SEP] The damage caused by Hugo also led to significant ecological repercussions. [CLS] [SEP] Habitat loss caused bat populations in Montserrat to fall 20-fold, while the populations of several endemic bird species declined or were disrupted across the eastern Caribbean. [CLS] [SEP] Coastal bird populations in South Carolina were forced 200 mi (320 km) inland. [CLS] [SEP]
