Typhoon Mireille, known in the Philippines as Typhoon Rosing, was the costliest typhoon on record. [CLS] [SEP] Striking Japan in September 1991, it became the 20th named storm of the 1991 Pacific typhoon season, Mireille formed on September 13 from the monsoon trough near the Marshall Islands. [CLS] [SEP] It moved westward for several days as a small system, steered by the subtropical ridge to the north. [CLS] [SEP] The storm rapidly intensified to typhoon status on September 16, and several days later passed north of Saipan in the Northern Marianas Islands. [CLS] [SEP] Mireille intensified further after deleterious effects from a nearby tropical storm subsided. [CLS] [SEP] On September 22, the American-based Joint Typhoon Warning Center (JTWC) estimated maximum 1‑minute sustained winds of 240 km/h (150 mph), and on the next day, the official Japan Meteorological Agency (JMA) estimated 10‑minute sustained winds of 185 km/h (115 mph). [CLS] [SEP] The typhoon weakened slightly while turning northward, passing just east of Miyako-jima and later to the west of Okinawa. [CLS] [SEP] On September 27, Mireille made landfall near Nagasaki in southwestern Japan with winds of 175 km/h (110 mph), the strongest since Typhoon Nancy in 1961. [CLS] [SEP] The storm accelerated to the northeast through the Sea of Japan, moving over Hokkaido before becoming extratropical on September 28. [CLS] [SEP] The remnants of Mireille continued to the east, passing through the Aleutian Islands of Alaska on October 1. [CLS] [SEP] The typhoon first threatened Guam, although it passed well to the north of the island, bringing damaging winds to northern Saipan. [CLS] [SEP] The first part of Japan affected was Miyako-jima, where heavy rainfall and high winds damaged crops. [CLS] [SEP] Mireille lashed Okinawa with strong waves, while strong winds up to 189 km/h (118 mph) damaged power lines and trees. [CLS] [SEP] The typhoon ultimately caused damage in 41 of 47 prefectures of Japan, with overall damage estimated at $10 billion (USD), making it the costliest typhoon on record as of 2017. [CLS] [SEP] Mireille produced record wind gusts at 26 locations, with a peak gust of 218 km/h (136 mph) in western Honshu. [CLS] [SEP] The winds caused record power outages across Japan that affected 7.36 million people, or about 13% of total customers. [CLS] [SEP] Mireille also left extensive crop damage totaling $3 billion, mostly to the apple industry, after 345,000 tons of apples fell to the ground and another 43,000 were damaged on the trees. [CLS] [SEP] The storm damaged over 670,000 houses, of which 1,058 were destroyed, and another 22,965 were flooded. [CLS] [SEP] Throughout Japan, Mireille killed 66 people and injured another 2,862 people, including ten deaths on a capsized freighter. [CLS] [SEP] Elsewhere, the typhoon killed two people in South Korea, and its remnants brought strong winds to Alaska. [CLS] [SEP]
