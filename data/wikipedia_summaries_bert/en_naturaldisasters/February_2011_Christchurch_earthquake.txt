[CLS] A Mw6.2 (ML6.3) earthquake occurred in Christchurch on Tuesday 22 February 2011 at 12:51 p.m. [SEP] [CLS] local time (23:51 UTC, 21 February). [SEP] [CLS] The earthquake struck the Canterbury region in New Zealand's South Island and was centred 6.7 kilometres (4.2 mi) south-east of the centre of Christchurch, New Zealand's second-most populous city. [SEP] [CLS] The earthquake caused widespread damage across Christchurch, killing 185 people in the nation's fifth-deadliest disaster. [SEP] [CLS] Christchurch's central city and eastern suburbs were badly affected, with damage to buildings and infrastructure already weakened by the magnitude 7.1 Canterbury earthquake of 4 September 2010 and its aftershocks. [SEP] [CLS] Significant liquefaction affected the eastern suburbs, producing around 400,000 tonnes of silt. [SEP] [CLS] The earthquake was felt across the South Island and parts of the lower and central North Island. [SEP] [CLS] While the initial quake only lasted for approximately 10 seconds, the damage was severe because of the location and shallowness of the earthquake's focus in relation to Christchurch as well as previous quake damage. [SEP] [CLS] Subsequent population loss saw the Christchurch main urban area fall behind the Wellington equivalent to decrease from second to third most populous area in New Zealand. [SEP] [CLS]
