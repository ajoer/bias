[CLS] Typhoon Parma, known in the Philippines as Typhoon Pepeng, was the second typhoon to affect the Philippines within the span of a week during September 2009. [SEP] [CLS] Typhoon Parma was assigned the name Pepeng by PAGASA when it entered the Philippine Area of Responsibility days after Typhoon Ketsana wreaked havoc on the country. [SEP] [CLS] Parma spared the capital and instead lashed the northern part of Luzon island. [SEP] [CLS] Parma added to the damage caused by the earlier Typhoon Ketsana, affecting thousands of families on the north, especially on Pangasinan province where the San Roque Dam inadvertently released water to prevent its breach. [SEP] [CLS] However, in the first week of October, Parma interacted with the incoming Typhoon Melor on the Pacific (via a Fujiwhara interaction), rendering it stationary as it made landfall on Southern Taiwan. [SEP] [CLS] Days later, the greatly weakened Parma retreated back to Luzon making further landfalls on Ilocos Norte and Cagayan. [SEP] [CLS] The now severe tropical storm Parma then began to wane its strength as it crossed Luzon island for the second time. [SEP] [CLS] It then emerged on the South China Sea as a tropical depression. [SEP] [CLS] Parma became one of the deadliest typhoons to hit the Philippines in a decade. [SEP] [CLS]
