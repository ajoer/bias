Severe Tropical Storm Delfina was a damaging tropical cyclone that affected southeastern Africa in January 2003. [CLS] [SEP] The fourth named storm of the 2002â€“03 South-West Indian Ocean cyclone season, Delfina formed off the northwest coast of Madagascar on December 30, 2002. [CLS] [SEP] It quickly intensified while moving westward, becoming a strong tropical storm before hitting northeastern Mozambique on December 31. [CLS] [SEP] Delfina weakened while moving inland, and it was no longer classifiable as a tropical cyclone by January 1, 2003. [CLS] [SEP] However, its remnants moved across the country and into Malawi, later looping around and crossing back over Mozambique; the remnants of Delfina were last observed on January 9. [CLS] [SEP] In both Mozambique and Malawi, Delfina dropped heavy rainfall that caused flooding. [CLS] [SEP] In the former country, over 18,000 houses were severely damaged or destroyed, leaving thousands homeless. [CLS] [SEP] The storm damaged roads and bridges, which disrupted relief efforts in the aftermath, and floods destroyed widespread areas of crops in the midst of an ongoing food shortage. [CLS] [SEP] Lingering flooding caused an outbreak of cholera and malaria in Mozambique, and 47 people were killed by Delfina. [CLS] [SEP] In Malawi, flooding was not widespread, although the storm destroyed about 3,600 houses and killed eight people. [CLS] [SEP] Only two months after the storm struck, however, Cyclone Japhet left damage and deaths in many of the same areas that Delfina affected. [CLS] [SEP]
