Tropical Cyclone Ann was a small and relatively weak off-season tropical cyclone that brought minor impacts to the Solomon Islands, Far North Queensland and coastal regions of the Northern Territory's Top End during May 2019. [CLS] [SEP] Ann was the twenty-fifth tropical low, eleventh tropical cyclone, ninth Category 2 tropical cyclone and second off-season tropical cyclone of the 2018–19 Australian region cyclone season. [CLS] [SEP] The system developed from a tropical low that formed on 7 May in the South Pacific cyclone region. [CLS] [SEP] The low gradually intensified while moving southwards, and strengthened into a tropical cyclone on 11 May. [CLS] [SEP] The storm then turned to the west-northwest and continued to strengthen over the Coral Sea. [CLS] [SEP] Ann reached peak intensity on 12 May as a Category 2 tropical cyclone on the Australian scale, with ten-minute sustained winds of 95 km/h (60 mph) and a central barometric pressure of 993 hPa (29.32 inHg). [CLS] [SEP] One-minute sustained winds of 100 km/h (65 mph) made Ann equivalent to a strong tropical storm on the Saffir-Simpson hurricane wind scale. [CLS] [SEP] The storm began to decay soon afterwards, and weakened to a gale-force tropical low on 14 May. [CLS] [SEP] Ann made landfall near Lockhart River on Cape York Peninsula on 15 May, before re-emerging over water a few hours later. [CLS] [SEP] Ann maintained a steady west-northwestwards track for several days before dissipating as a tropical low near East Timor on 18 May. [CLS] [SEP] Impacts associated with Ann were minor, and no fatalities or damages were attributed to the system. [CLS] [SEP] Willis Island experienced marginal gale-force winds as Ann passed nearby on 13 May, and several other islands closer to the Queensland coast experienced similar conditions. [CLS] [SEP] Heavy rainfall and gusty winds were experienced in many areas to the south of the remnant tropical low as it made landfall. [CLS] [SEP] Precipitation totals exceeding 50 mm (2.0 in) were recorded, with one 24-hour total reaching 93 mm (3.7 in). [CLS] [SEP] Increased winds also occurred in coastal areas of the Top End on 15–17 May. [CLS] [SEP] By maximum sustained winds, Ann was the strongest entirely off-season tropical cyclone in the Australian region since Alex in 2001, and the strongest to form in the region during May since Rhonda in 1997. [CLS] [SEP] Ann was also the first tropical system of any intensity to make landfall in Queensland during the off-season since Zane in 2013. [CLS] [SEP]
