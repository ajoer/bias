Typhoon Meranti, known in the Philippines as Typhoon Ferdie, was one of the most intense tropical cyclones on record. [CLS] [SEP] Impacting the Batanes in the Philippines, Taiwan, as well as Fujian Province in September 2016, Meranti formed as a tropical depression on September 8 near the island of Guam. [CLS] [SEP] Tracking to the west northwest, Meranti gradually intensified until September 11, at which point it began a period of rapid intensification. [CLS] [SEP] Continuing to rapidly intensify, it became a super typhoon early on September 12, as it passed through the Luzon Strait, ultimately reaching its peak intensity on September 13 with 1-minute sustained winds of 315 km/h (195 mph). [CLS] [SEP] Shortly afterwards, it passed directly over the island of Itbayat. [CLS] [SEP] Meranti passed to the south of Taiwan as a super typhoon, and began weakening steadily as a result of land interaction. [CLS] [SEP] By September 15, it struck Fujian Province as a Category 2-equivalent typhoon, becoming the strongest typhoon on record to impact the province. [CLS] [SEP] Upon moving inland, rapid weakening ensued and Meranti became extratropical the next day, dissipating shortly afterwards after it passed to the south of the Korean Peninsula. [CLS] [SEP] The island of Itbayat sustained a direct hit from the super typhoon near its peak intensity, severing communications from the island for several days. [CLS] [SEP] No fatalities were reported on the island from the island. [CLS] [SEP] The typhoon caused ₱244.99 million (US$5.16 million) in damage on the island. [CLS] [SEP] However, the most costly and direct impacts were felt in eastern China, where 45 people were killed from floods. [CLS] [SEP] Total economic cost in China reached ¥31.78 billion (US$4.76 billion). [CLS] [SEP] In total, Meranti caused US$4.79 billion in damage and killed 47 people. [CLS] [SEP] During its lifetime, Meranti broke or tied several meteorological records. [CLS] [SEP] With JTWC-estimated 1-minute sustained winds of 315 km/h (195 mph), Meranti is tied with Typhoon Haiyan as the second-strongest tropical cyclone on record by wind speed. [CLS] [SEP] Additionally, in terms of 1-minute sustained winds, the storm's landfall on the island of Itbayat shortly after peak intensity ties it with Haiyan as the strongest landfalling tropical cyclone on record. [CLS] [SEP] The estimated pressure of 890 mbar (26 inHg) was also the lowest on record in the Western Pacific since Typhoon Megi in 2010. [CLS] [SEP]
