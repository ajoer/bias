[CLS] Tropical Cyclone Emma was a weak but unusually large tropical cyclone that affected a substantial portion of Western Australia during the 2005â€“06 Australian region cyclone season. [SEP] [CLS] Forming out of an area of low pressure on 25 February, the precursor to Emma slowly tracked southward. [SEP] [CLS] Although classified tropical, the structure of the system represented that of a monsoonal storm. [SEP] [CLS] However, low wind shear and well-developed outflow gradually allowed convection to develop near the centre of circulation. [SEP] [CLS] As the system approached the Pilbara coastline of Western Australia on 27 February, it intensified into a Category 1 cyclone and attained peak 10-minute sustained winds of 75 km/h (45 mph). [SEP] [CLS] After moving inland near Mardie, Emma weakened to a tropical low but became exceedingly large; its cloud cover obscured most of Western Australia. [SEP] [CLS] The remnants of the weak storm persisted until 1 March, at which time they dissipated over the Great Australian Bight. [SEP] [CLS] Although a weak storm, rainfall from Emma caused flooding in numerous parts of Western Australia. [SEP] [CLS] In Karratha, six people required rescue after their cars became stranded in floodwaters. [SEP] [CLS] The most significant damage took place along the Murchison River which swelled to roughly 20 km (12 mi) in width. [SEP] [CLS] Although only one town was threatened by the river, large areas of farmland were inundated by the expanding river, leading to substantial agricultural losses. [SEP] [CLS] Despite the extensive flooding, no fatalities were reported as a result of Emma. [SEP] [CLS]
