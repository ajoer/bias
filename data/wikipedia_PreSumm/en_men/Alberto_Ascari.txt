[CLS] Alberto Ascari (Italian pronunciation: [alˈbɛrto ˈaskari]; 13 July 1918 – 26 May 1955) was an Italian racing driver and twice Formula One World Champion. [SEP] [CLS] He was a multitalented racer who competed in motorcycle racing before switching to cars. [SEP] [CLS] Ascari won consecutive world titles in 1952 and 1953 for Scuderia Ferrari. [SEP] [CLS] He was the team's first World Champion and the last Italian to date to win the title. [SEP] [CLS] This was sandwiched by an appearance in the 1952 Indianapolis 500. [SEP] [CLS] Ascari also won the Mille Miglia in 1954. [SEP] [CLS] Ascari was noted for the careful precision and finely-judged accuracy that made him one of the safest drivers in a most dangerous era. [SEP] [CLS] Ascari remains along with Michael Schumacher Ferrari's only back-to-back World Champions, and he is also Ferrari's sole Italian champion. [SEP] [CLS] As the first driver to win multiple World Championship titles, he held the record for most World Championship titles in 1952-54, as a result he is one of 3 drivers to have held the record for most World Championship titles. [SEP] [CLS] Juan Manuel Fangio held the record in 1951-52 and 1954-2002 (jointly with Ascari in 1952 and 1954) and Michael Schumacher has held the record since 2002. [SEP] [CLS] When Alberto was a young child, his father, Antonio, who was also a famous racing driver, died in an accident at the 1925 French Grand Prix. [SEP] [CLS] Alberto once admitted that he warned his children not to become extremely close to him because of the risk involved in his profession. [SEP] [CLS] Unfortunately, his warning proved true when he was killed during a test session for Scuderia Ferrari at the Autodromo Nazionale Monza. [SEP] [CLS] Ascari was notoriously superstitious and took great pains to avoid tempting fate. [SEP] [CLS] His unexplained fatal accident – at the same age as his father's, on the same day of the month and in eerily similar circumstances – remains one of Formula One racing's great tragic coincidences.
