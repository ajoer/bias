Hurricane Richard was a damaging hurricane that affected areas of Central America in October 2010. [CLS] [SEP] It developed on October 20 from an area of low pressure that had stalled in the Caribbean Sea. [CLS] [SEP] The system moved to the southeast before turning to the west. [CLS] [SEP] The storm slowly organized, and the system intensified into a tropical storm. [CLS] [SEP] Initially, Richard only intensified slowly in an area of week steering currents. [CLS] [SEP] However, by October 23, wind shear diminished, and the storm intensified faster as it headed toward Belize. [CLS] [SEP] The next day, Richard intensified into hurricane status, and further into its peak intensity as a Category 2 hurricane, reaching maximum winds of 100 mph (150 km/h). [CLS] [SEP] The hurricane made its only landfall on Belize at peak intensity. [CLS] [SEP] Over land, Richard quickly weakened, and later degenerated into a remnant low on October 25. [CLS] [SEP] Hurricane Richard caused an estimated $80 million (2010 USD) in damages in its path, much of which was in Belize. [CLS] [SEP] In Honduras, damage was mostly limited to power outages and landslides. [CLS] [SEP] In Belize, most of the damage was attributed to damage to crops. [CLS] [SEP] Power outages were also widespread across the country. [CLS] [SEP] Two fatalities occurred in Belize, one direct and the other indirect. [CLS] [SEP] One person drowned after his ship capsized during the storm and another was mauled to death by a jaguar that had escaped its cage. [CLS] [SEP]
