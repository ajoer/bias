Tropical Storm Zeta was a very late-developing tropical storm over the central Atlantic that formed after the 2005 Atlantic hurricane season (had officially ended on November 30) and continued into January 2006. [CLS] [SEP] Becoming a tropical depression at approximately midnight on December 30 (UTC), it became the record-breaking thirtieth tropical cyclone of the 2005 Atlantic hurricane season and after intensifying into Tropical Storm Zeta six hours later, it became the season's twenty-seventh named storm. [CLS] [SEP] Zeta was one of only two Atlantic tropical cyclones to span two calendar years (the other being Hurricane Alice in 1954â€“55). [CLS] [SEP] Zeta originated from an area of low pressure on December 29, which previously developed within an upper-level trough. [CLS] [SEP] After becoming a tropical storm, the National Hurricane Center continually predicted it would weaken rapidly. [CLS] [SEP] Like the previous tropical cyclone, Hurricane Epsilon, Zeta defied these predictions. [CLS] [SEP] The storm reached its peak strength on January 2, 2006, before degenerating into a remnant low on January 6 and dissipating on the next day. [CLS] [SEP] Since Zeta never approached land, there was no impact from the storm other than minor shipping problems. [CLS] [SEP] Several ships encountered the storm, and several crews in the 2005 Atlantic Rowing Race were affected by rough seas and high winds. [CLS] [SEP]
