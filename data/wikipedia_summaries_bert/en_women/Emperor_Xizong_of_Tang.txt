Emperor Xizong of Tang (June 8, 862 – April 20, 888), né Li Yan, later name changed to Li Xuan (Chinese: 李儇, changed 873), was an emperor of the Tang dynasty of China. [CLS] [SEP] He reigned from 873 to 888. [CLS] [SEP] He was the fifth son of his predecessor Emperor Yizong and was the elder brother of his successor Emperor Zhaozong. [CLS] [SEP] His reign saw his realm overrun by the great agrarian rebellions led by Wang Xianzhi and Huang Chao, and while both were eventually defeated, by the end of Emperor Xizong's reign, the Tang state had virtually disintegrated into pieces ruled by individual warlords, rather than the imperial government, and would never recover, falling eventually in 907.
