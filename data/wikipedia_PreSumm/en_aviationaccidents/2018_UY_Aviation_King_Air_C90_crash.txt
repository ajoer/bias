[SEP] [CLS] Five people lost their lives in this accident; 2 pilots, 1 Technician, 1 Aircraft Maintenance Engineer, and 1 civilian. [SEP] [CLS] The cause of the accident is unknown as of July 2018.The Aircraft Accident Investigation Board released the final investigation report in Dec 2018. [SEP] [CLS] The probable cause of the accident as per the report was a stall caused by lack of situational awareness due to spatial disorientation triggered by deteriorating weather, a transition from ILS(IMC) to visual flying (Partial VMC) and unexpected bank owing to differential engine power. [SEP] [CLS] The report indicts the Indian DGCA for violation of regulations in granting the Air Operator Permit. [SEP] [CLS] The aircraft VT-UPZ was previously owned by the Uttar Pradesh government. [SEP] [CLS] In 2014 the aircraft met with an accident in Allahabad in which there was substantial damage but the DGCA investigation termed it as a minor incident.

[SEP] [CLS] Amit Singh FRAeS an aviation safety and human factors blogger carried out a detailed independent analysis of the accident and submitted the report to the Secretary, Ministry of Civil Aviation, India. [SEP] [CLS] Capt. [SEP] [CLS] Amit Singh has stated that the AAIB investigation is manipulated and does not correctly identify the cause of the accident, therefore, needs an investigation by a court of inquiry. [SEP] [CLS] The investigation has completely shielded the operator who was granted an Air Operator Permit by the Indian DGCA without having filled the mandatory post of the Chief of Safety. [SEP] [CLS] As per the technical report, both engines malfunctioned in flight probably due to which the aircraft crashed. [SEP] [CLS]
