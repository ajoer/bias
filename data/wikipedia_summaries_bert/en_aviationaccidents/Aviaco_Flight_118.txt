[CLS] [SEP] One person in the village also died.Flight 118 was a seasonal daily flight from Madrid to A Coruña favoured by tourists. [CLS] [SEP] Local news reports indicated that AV-118 was a special "vacation flight" run by Aviaco during the summer season, so as to provide easy access to Galicia's numerous ocean-side resorts.The aircraft had taken off normally from Madrid at 9:14 a.m. [CLS] [SEP] CEST. [CLS] [SEP] After an uneventful journey, the commander contacted the control tower at La Coruña Airport at 10:14, and was informed of the poor visibility in the area at that time. [CLS] [SEP] Despite being advised to stand by in anticipation of an early improvement in weather conditions, the crew began a first approach at 10:23 to check the actual visibility. [CLS] [SEP] The manoeuvre was frustrated, and the aircraft returned to an altitude of 2000 metres. [CLS] [SEP] After a second unsuccessful approach, at 11:20 the tower warned Flight 118 that the fog was lifting, and that the horizontal visibility had increased to about 1500 meters and the vertical visibility was close to 300 meters. [CLS] [SEP] At 11:39, the crew reported that they had begun a new approach, this being the last communication received by the airport control tower. [CLS] [SEP] Shortly afterwards the aircraft hit eucalyptus trees, struck the ground and collided with the abandoned farmhouse before bursting into flames. [CLS] [SEP] The collision and fire killed 84 of the aircraft's 85 occupants immediately. [CLS] [SEP] The only survivor, who was taken to the Hospital in La Coruña, died a few hours later as a result of the serious injuries suffered.
