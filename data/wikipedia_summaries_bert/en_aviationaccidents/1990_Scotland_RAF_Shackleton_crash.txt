On 30 April 1990, a Royal Air Force Avro Shackleton AEW Mk II aircraft, of No. [CLS] [SEP] 8 Squadron RAF, based at RAF Lossiemouth, crashed into a hill on the Isle of Harris whilst attempting to land at RAF Benbecula. [CLS] [SEP] All ten crew on board died in the crash, which included the wing commander who was in charge of No. [CLS] [SEP] 8 Squadron at the time. [CLS] [SEP] The Shackleton was the last of the fleet to be involved in a fatal accident, and the type was withdrawn from RAF service in 1991. [CLS] [SEP] A Board of Inquiry (BoI) later determined the accident as a controlled flight into terrain, but could not ascertain as to why. [CLS] [SEP]
