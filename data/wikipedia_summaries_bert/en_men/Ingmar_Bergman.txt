[SEP] [CLS] Philip French referred to Bergman as "one of the greatest artists of the 20th century ... [SEP] [CLS] he found in literature and the performing arts a way of both recreating and questioning the human condition." Director Martin Scorsese commented: "If you were alive in the 50s and the 60s and of a certain age, a teenager on your way to becoming an adult, and you wanted to make movies, I don't see how you couldn't be influenced by Bergman ....It's impossible to overestimate the effect that those films had on people."
