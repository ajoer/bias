[CLS] Typhoon Forrest, known in the Philippines as Typhoon Ising, was the third-most intense typhoon on record, behind Typhoon Tip of 1979 and Typhoon June of 1975. [SEP] [CLS] Forrest was also the fastest-intensifying tropical cyclone on record, with its minimum barometric pressure dropping from 976 millibars to 876 millibars—a drop of 100 millibars—from September 22 to September 23, in less than a day. [SEP] [CLS] Forrest affected Japan in September 1983 and formed from a tropical disturbance far from land in the western Pacific Ocean. [SEP] [CLS] On September 20, the system was classified as a tropical storm, and thereafter began to intensify. [SEP] [CLS] The next day, Forrest reached typhoon status, and the intensification process accelerated. [SEP] [CLS] The storm prudently strengthened on September 22, and the following morning, attained peak intensity following a pressure drop of 100 mbar (3.0 inHg) in slightly less than 24 hours. [SEP] [CLS] Thereafter, Forrest began to weaken slowly as it moved northwest. [SEP] [CLS] Approaching Japan, Super Typhoon Forrest first hit Okinawa on September 27. [SEP] [CLS] Nearby, a tornado hit Inza Island, destroying 26 homes and injuring 26 people. [SEP] [CLS] Forrest then moved north, impaling the Japanese archipelago before transitioning into an extratropical cyclone on September 28, before eventually dissipating on October 4. [SEP] [CLS] The torrential rainfall caused by the typhoon triggered deadly landslides and flooding across Japan. [SEP] [CLS] In all, the typhoon killed at least 21 people, left 17 listed as missing, and injured 86. [SEP] [CLS] Forrest flooded 46,000 homes in muddy water, over 100 dwellings were destroyed, and 2,560 people were rendered as homeless. [SEP] [CLS] Seven flights were called off and 27,000 people were stranded. [SEP] [CLS] In addition, 67 bridges and 818 roads were damaged. [SEP] [CLS]
