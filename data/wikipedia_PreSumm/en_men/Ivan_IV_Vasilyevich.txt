[CLS] Ivan IV Vasilyevich (; Russian: Ива́н Васи́льевич, tr. [SEP] [CLS] Ivan Vasilyevich; 25 August 1530 – 28 March [O.S. [SEP] [CLS] 18 March] 1584), commonly known as Ivan the Terrible (Russian: Ива́н Гро́зный​ Ivan Grozny; "Ivan the Formidable" or "Ivan the Fearsome", Latin: Ioannes Severus), was the Grand Prince of Moscow from 1533 to 1547 and the first Tsar of Russia from 1547 to 1584. [SEP] [CLS] Ivan was the son of Vasili III, the Rurikid ruler of the Grand Duchy of Moscow and was appointed Grand Prince when he was three years old after his father's death. [SEP] [CLS] A group of reformers united around the young Ivan and known as the "Chosen Council", declared him tsar (emperor) of All Rus' in 1547 at the age of 16 and established the Tsardom of Russia with Moscow as the predominant state. [SEP] [CLS] Ivan's reign was characterised by Russia's transformation from a medieval state to an empire under the tsar but at an immense cost to its people and its broader, long-term economy. [SEP] [CLS] During his youth was a conquest of the Khanate of Kazan and the Khanate of Astrakhan. [SEP] [CLS] After he had consolidated his power, Ivan got rid of the advisers from the "Chosen Council" and triggered the Livonian War, which ravaged Russia and resulted in the loss of Livonia and Ingria but allowed him to establish greater autocratic control over Russia's nobility, which he violently purged by the Oprichnina. [SEP] [CLS] The later years of Ivan's reign were also marked by the Massacre of Novgorod and the burning of Moscow by Tatars. [SEP] [CLS] Historic sources present disparate accounts of Ivan's complex personality. [SEP] [CLS] He was described as intelligent and devout but also prone to paranoia, rages, and episodic outbreaks of mental instability that increased with age. [SEP] [CLS] Ivan is popularly believed to have killed his eldest son and heir, Ivan Ivanovich, and the latter's unborn son during his outbursts, which left his younger son, the politically-ineffectual Feodor Ivanovich, to inherit the throne, a man whose rule directly led to the end of the Rurikid dynasty and to the beginning of the Time of Troubles.
