[CLS] Hurricane Igor was the most destructive tropical cyclone on record to strike the Canadian island of Newfoundland. [SEP] [CLS] It originated from a broad area of low pressure that moved off the western coast of Africa on September 6, 2010. [SEP] [CLS] Tracking slowly westward, it developed into a tropical depression on September 8 and strengthened into a tropical storm shortly thereafter. [SEP] [CLS] Higher wind shear temporarily halted intensification over the following days. [SEP] [CLS] On September 12, however, explosive intensification took place, and Igor reached Category 4 status on the Saffir–Simpson Hurricane Wind Scale. [SEP] [CLS] By this time, Igor had already begun a prolonged turn around the western periphery of the subtropical ridge. [SEP] [CLS] After becoming the strongest cyclone of the season, with maximum sustained winds of 155 mph (250 km/h), it began to enter an area unfavorable for continued strengthening. [SEP] [CLS] Igor gradually weakened before brushing Bermuda as a minimal hurricane on September 20. [SEP] [CLS] After turning northeastward, the system began an extratropical transition, which it completed shortly after striking southern Newfoundland. [SEP] [CLS] The remnants of Igor were later absorbed by another extratropical cyclone over the Labrador Sea on September 23. [SEP] [CLS] While the hurricane was over the open ocean, it produced large swells that caused the deaths of four people — two in the Caribbean, one in Newfoundland and one in the United States. [SEP] [CLS] As it passed west of Bermuda as a minimal hurricane, damage was primarily limited to trees and power lines, with roughly 27,500 residences losing electricity. [SEP] [CLS] Total losses in the territory were less than US$500,000. [SEP] [CLS] However, in Newfoundland, Igor brought severe damage, claimed to be the worst ever seen in some areas. [SEP] [CLS] Large stretches of roadways were completely washed out by flooding, including a portion of the Trans-Canada Highway, isolating approximately 150 communities. [SEP] [CLS] Throughout the region, one person was killed and damage costs amounted to a record C$200 million. [SEP] [CLS] In the storm's wake, military personnel were deployed to assist in recovery efforts and aid distribution. [SEP] [CLS]
