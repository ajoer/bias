[CLS] On the morning of August 14, 2017, significant mudflow events occurred in and around the capital city of Freetown in Sierra Leone. [SEP] [CLS] Following three days of torrential rainfall, mass wasting of mud and debris damaged or destroyed hundreds of buildings in the city, killing 1,141 people and leaving more than 3,000 homeless. [SEP] [CLS] Causal factors for the mudslides include the region's particular topography and climate â€“ with Freetown's elevation close to sea level and its greater position within a tropical monsoon climate. [SEP] [CLS] Those factors were assisted by the generally poor state of the region's infrastructure and loss of protective natural drainage systems from periods of deforestation. [SEP] [CLS]
