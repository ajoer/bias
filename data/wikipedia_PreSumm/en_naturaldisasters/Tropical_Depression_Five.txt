[CLS] The 1994 Atlantic hurricane season was the final season in the most recent low-activity era (“cold phase”) of tropical cyclone formation in the Atlantic. [SEP] [CLS] Despite the below average activity, the season was very deadly, with most of the deaths occurring during Hurricane Gordon, a devastating late-season tropical cyclone that caused severe impacts to the Caribbean Sea, the Greater Antilles and the United States, and one of the longest-lived Atlantic hurricanes on record at the time. [SEP] [CLS] The season produced seven named tropical cyclones and three hurricanes, a total below the seasonal average. [SEP] [CLS] The season officially started on June 1 and ended on November 30, dates which conventionally limit the period during which most tropical cyclones form in the Atlantic Ocean. [SEP] [CLS] The first tropical cyclone, Tropical Storm Alberto, developed on June 30, while the last storm, Hurricane Gordon, dissipated on November 21. [SEP] [CLS] The season was unusual in that it produced no major hurricanes, which are those of Category 3 status or higher on the Saffir–Simpson hurricane scale. [SEP] [CLS] The most intense hurricane, Hurricane Florence, peaked as a Category 2 storm with winds of 110 mph (180 km/h). [SEP] [CLS] Aside from Chris, Florence, and Gordon, none of the storms exceeded tropical storm intensity. [SEP] [CLS] Tropical Storm Alberto produced significant rainfall and flooding in the Southeastern United States, damaging or destroying over 18,000 homes. [SEP] [CLS] In August, Tropical Storm Beryl produced heavy rainfall in Florida, Georgia, South Carolina, and North Carolina, with moderate to heavy rainfall throughout several other states. [SEP] [CLS] Beryl caused numerous injuries, many of which occurred from a tornado associated with the tropical storm. [SEP] [CLS] Tropical Storm Debby killed nine people in the Caribbean in September. [SEP] [CLS] Hurricane Gordon was the most significant storm of the season, causing damage from Costa Rica to North Carolina among its six landfalls. [SEP] [CLS] Extreme flooding and mudslides from Gordon caused approximately 1,122 fatalities in Haiti. [SEP] [CLS] In addition, a nor'easter in December may have had tropical characteristics, though due to the uncertainty, it was not classified as a tropical system. [SEP] [CLS]
