Severe Tropical Cyclone Thelma was a tropical cyclone that affected northern Australia from 6 December 1998 until 12 December 1998. [CLS] [SEP] Cyclone Thelma was one of the most intense tropical cyclones to be observed off the coast of Australia. [CLS] [SEP] Thelma formed in the Arafura Sea north of the Northern Territory while intensifying rapidly into a Category 5 cyclone, passing very near the Tiwi Islands and posing a severe threat to Darwin, but passed by at a distance of 200 km (120 mi). [CLS] [SEP] It then moved across the Timor Sea before hitting the north Kimberley coast. [CLS] [SEP] Thelma was the first known Category 5 cyclone to be observed in the Timor Sea, and was also the most intense cyclone to threaten Darwin since Cyclone Tracy on Christmas Eve in 1974. [CLS] [SEP] Ten months after the storm's passage, the skull of an 81-year-old man, who was believed to have been swept away by flood waters, was discovered. [CLS] [SEP]
