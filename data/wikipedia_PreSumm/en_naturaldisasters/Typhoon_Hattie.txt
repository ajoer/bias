[CLS] Typhoon Hattie, known in the Philippines as Typhoon Pasing, was the fifth tropical cyclone of a record-six to hit Japan during the 1990 Pacific typhoon season. [SEP] [CLS] Hattie originated from an area of disturbed weather that developed within the Western Pacific monsoon trough towards the end of September. [SEP] [CLS] Tracking westward, the disturbance initially was slow to develop, although on September 30, the system was classified as a tropical depression. [SEP] [CLS] Following an improvement of its convective structure and an increase in associated convection, the depression was upgraded into Tropical Storm Hattie on October 1. [SEP] [CLS] Following the development of an eye, Hattie attained typhoon intensity on October 2. [SEP] [CLS] The typhoon continued to slowly deepen as its forward speed slowed. [SEP] [CLS] Despite a decrease in cloud top temperatures around the eye, Hattie was estimated to have attained peak intensity on October 5. [SEP] [CLS] After recurving to the north and then northeast, Hattie began to slowly weaken due to increased wind shear. [SEP] [CLS] On October 7, Hattie lost typhoon intensity, and after tracking directly over Tokyo, transitioned into an extratropical cyclone on the next day. [SEP] [CLS] Although the inner core of Typhoon Hattie stayed offshore Japan, torrential rains were accountable for 68 landslides through the country. [SEP] [CLS] A total of 1,100 homes were flooded. [SEP] [CLS] Three people were killed, one was reported missing and nineteen others were injured, including six in Kyoto. [SEP] [CLS] Elsewhere, power lines were downed in 1,035 spots in Okinawa, mostly from sugar cane, vegetables, and flowers. [SEP] [CLS] Nationwide, damage was estimated at $9.9 million (1990 USD).
