[SEP] [CLS] A member of the Democratic Party, Clinton was known as a New Democrat, and many of his policies reflected a centrist "Third Way" political philosophy. [SEP] [CLS] He is the husband of former secretary of state, former U.S. [SEP] [CLS] senator, and two-time candidate for president Hillary Clinton. [SEP] [CLS] Clinton was born and raised in Arkansas and attended Georgetown University, University College, Oxford, and Yale Law School.

[SEP] [CLS] Clinton was elected president in 1992, defeating incumbent Republican opponent George H. [SEP] [CLS] W. [SEP] [CLS] Bush. [SEP] [CLS] At age 46, he became the third-youngest president in history. [SEP] [CLS] Clinton presided over the longest period of peacetime economic expansion in American history.
