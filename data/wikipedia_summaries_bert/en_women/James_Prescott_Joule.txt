James Prescott Joule (; 24 December 1818 â€“ 11 October 1889) was an English physicist, mathematician and brewer, born in Salford, Lancashire. [CLS] [SEP] Joule studied the nature of heat, and discovered its relationship to mechanical work (see energy). [CLS] [SEP] This led to the law of conservation of energy, which in turn led to the development of the first law of thermodynamics. [CLS] [SEP] The SI derived unit of energy, the joule, is named after him. [CLS] [SEP] He worked with Lord Kelvin to develop an absolute thermodynamic temperature scale, which came to be called the Kelvin scale. [CLS] [SEP] Joule also made observations of magnetostriction, and he found the relationship between the current through a resistor and the heat dissipated, which is also called Joule's first law. [CLS] [SEP] His experiments about energy transformations were first published in 1843. [CLS] [SEP]
