[CLS] Hurricane Otto was the first tropical cyclone since Hurricane Cesar–Douglas in 1996 to survive the crossover from the Atlantic Ocean to the Pacific Ocean. [SEP] [CLS] Forming late on November 20 in the southwestern Caribbean Sea, Otto was the fifteenth and final named storm, seventh hurricane and fourth major hurricane of the 2016 Atlantic hurricane season. [SEP] [CLS] It quickly intensified into a strong tropical storm the next day, and on November 23–24, rapidly strengthened into a Category 3 major hurricane, the first in the month of November since Hurricane Paloma in 2008, and the latest date an Atlantic hurricane attained such intensity on record. [SEP] [CLS] Otto made landfall in Nicaragua at peak intensity on November 24, thus becoming the latest hurricane to make landfall in the Atlantic basin since 1851 when records began. [SEP] [CLS] Traveling along the Nicaragua–Costa Rica border, the system rapidly weakened to a tropical storm before emerging over the eastern Pacific Ocean, becoming the final storm of the 2016 Pacific hurricane season as well. [SEP] [CLS] Hostile environmental conditions inhibited reorganization, and Otto subsequently degenerated into an elongated trough on November 26. [SEP] [CLS] The hurricane's unusually southern formation in the Caribbean Sea led to impacts in countries rarely affected by tropical cyclones. [SEP] [CLS] In particular, Panama and Costa Rica suffered extensive damage. [SEP] [CLS] The storm claimed at least 23 lives: 10 in Costa Rica, 9 in Panama, and 4 in Nicaragua. [SEP] [CLS] Otto also dropped torrential rainfall across the affected regions; some areas received up towards a month's worth of rain in only a matter of a day, which led to life-threatening flooding, which in turn led to landslides. [SEP] [CLS] After the storm had passed, recovery efforts begun with the national mourning of the victims, followed by clean-up efforts. [SEP] [CLS] Overall, total economic losses from the hurricane exceeded US$190 million. [SEP] [CLS]
