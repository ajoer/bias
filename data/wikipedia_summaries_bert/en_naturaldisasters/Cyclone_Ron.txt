Severe Tropical Cyclone Ron was the strongest tropical cyclone on record to impact Tonga. [CLS] [SEP] The system was first noted as a tropical depression, to the northeast of Samoa on January 1, 1998. [CLS] [SEP] Over the next day the system gradually developed further and was named Ron as it developed into a Category 1 tropical cyclone on the Australian tropical cyclone intensity scale during the next day. [CLS] [SEP] The system subsequently continued to move south-westwards and became a Category 3 severe tropical cyclone, as it passed near Swains Island during January 3. [CLS] [SEP] intensification proceeded at a fairly rapid rate. [CLS] [SEP] Ron reached the peak intensity of 145 mph (225 km/h) on January 5, becoming one of the most intense cyclones in the Southern hemisphere in that decade, when Ron was at north-northwest of Apia, Samoa, three days after initial development. [CLS] [SEP] The cyclone maintained this strength for about 36 hours, while re-curving to the south-southeast. [CLS] [SEP] Then, Ron started weakening while passing between central Tonga and Niue on January 7. [CLS] [SEP] Finally, by January 9, Ron was absorbed by the much larger circulation of Severe Tropical Cyclone Susan. [CLS] [SEP]
