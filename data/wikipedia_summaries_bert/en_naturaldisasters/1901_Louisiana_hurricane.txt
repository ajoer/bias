[CLS] [SEP] It then crossed through the islands and intensified only slightly. [CLS] [SEP] Late on August 10, the storm made landfall near Deerfield Beach, Florida. [CLS] [SEP] After reaching the Gulf of Mexico the next day, continuous intensifying occurred and by August 12, the storm reached hurricane status.
