Réal Bouvier (January 6, 1946 – January 9, 2000) was a Canadian navigator and a Quebec journalist. [CLS] [SEP] In 1977, he crossed the Northwest Passage, from east to west, in command of JE Bernier II, a sailing boat of 10.5 meters. [CLS] [SEP] The JE Bernier II remains the smallest vessel to have made the crossing in one season and the first sailing boat to have circumnavigated North America, a journey of 18,500 nautical miles. [CLS] [SEP] JE Bouvier did not complete the northwest passage in one season as the passage is only completed upon reaching the Pacific. [CLS] [SEP] Not to mention that Bouvier also wintered on passage in Greenland. [CLS] [SEP] Thus the voyage took three seasons not one. [CLS] [SEP]
