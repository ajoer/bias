Tropical Storm Marco was the smallest tropical cyclone on record. [CLS] [SEP] The thirteenth named storm of the 2008 Atlantic hurricane season, Marco developed out of a broad area of low pressure over the northwestern Caribbean during late September 2008. [CLS] [SEP] Influenced by a tropical wave on October 4, a small low-level circulation center developed over Belize. [CLS] [SEP] After crossing the southern end of the Yucat√°n Peninsula and emerging into the Bay of Campeche, the low was declared Tropical Depression Thirteen early on October 6. [CLS] [SEP] The depression quickly intensified into a tropical storm and was given the name Marco later that day. [CLS] [SEP] Marco reached its peak intensity with winds of 65 mph (100 km/h) early on October 7. [CLS] [SEP] Around this time, tropical storm force winds extended 11.5 miles (18.5 km) from the center of the storm, making Marco the smallest tropical cyclone on record. [CLS] [SEP] Around 1200 UTC, Marco made landfall near Misantla, Veracruz. [CLS] [SEP] The storm rapidly weakened after landfall, dissipating later that day. [CLS] [SEP] Due to its small size, Marco caused minimal damage; however, the storm's heavy rains led to floods up to 10 feet (3.05 m) deep that covered highways and damaged homes. [CLS] [SEP]
