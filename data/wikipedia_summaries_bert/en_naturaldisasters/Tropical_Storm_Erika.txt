Tropical Storm Erika was, at the time, the deadliest and most destructive natural disaster in Dominica since Hurricane David in 1979. [CLS] [SEP] The fifth named storm of the season, Erika developed from a westward-moving tropical wave while well east of the Lesser Antilles. [CLS] [SEP] Hostile conditions, including dry air and wind shear, inhibited significant development, and Erika failed to acquire sustained winds beyond 50 mph (85 km/h). [CLS] [SEP] Contrary to predictions of a northwesterly recurvature, the cyclone persisted on a westerly course and passed through the Leeward Islands and emerged over the Caribbean Sea on August 27. [CLS] [SEP] Erika succumbed to adverse conditions the following day, dissipating as a tropical cyclone near the Dominican Republic. [CLS] [SEP] The remnant system persisted for several more days, ultimately moving across the Gulf of Mexico, before dissipating over Georgia on September 3. [CLS] [SEP] Several islands experienced heavy rainfall during the passage of Erika, especially Dominica. [CLS] [SEP] The storm's asymmetric structure, coupled with the mountainous terrain of the island and ample moisture aloft, led to rainfall accumulations up to 33 in (850 mm). [CLS] [SEP] With grounds already saturated from antecedent rainfall, tremendous runoff quickly overwhelmed river basins and triggered catastrophic floods. [CLS] [SEP] Accompanying mudslides worsened the situation, temporarily damming the rivers before collapsing. [CLS] [SEP] Hundreds of homes were left uninhabitable and thousands of people were displaced; the entire town of Petite Savanne was evacuated and subsequently abandoned as a result of the storm. [CLS] [SEP] All told, 30 people died across the island in the nation's worst disaster since Hurricane David. [CLS] [SEP] The storm's devastating effects in Dominica prompted an influx of international assistance. [CLS] [SEP] Aid from multiple nations and intergovernmental organizations poured in to assist victims of the storm. [CLS] [SEP] Thousands of homes needed to be built or repaired, including 500â€“1,000 for the relocation of all of Petite Savanne's residents. [CLS] [SEP] Recovery in Dominica was halted in September 2017 by Hurricane Maria, a Category 5 hurricane that wrought far greater devastation on the island. [CLS] [SEP] In Guadeloupe, heavy rainfall in the vicinity of Basse-Terre caused flooding and mudslides, forcing roads to temporarily close. [CLS] [SEP] Approximately 250,000 people in Puerto Rico were left without electricity. [CLS] [SEP] The island experienced US$17.37 million in agricultural damage. [CLS] [SEP] In the Dominican Republic, a weather station in Barahona measured 24.26 in (616 mm) of rain, including 8.8 in (220 mm) in a single hour. [CLS] [SEP] About 823 homes suffered damage and 7,345 people were displaced. [CLS] [SEP] Five people died in Haiti, four from a weather-related traffic accident and one from a landslide. [CLS] [SEP] Total damage from Erika is estimated to be over US$500 million, with US$482.8 million in Dominica alone. [CLS] [SEP]
