[CLS] Low German or Low Saxon (German: Plattdeutsch, pronounced [ˈplatdɔɪ̯t͡ʃ] (listen) or German: Platt, pronounced [plat] (listen)) is a West Germanic language variety spoken mainly in Northern Germany and the northeastern part of the Netherlands. [SEP] [CLS] It is also spoken to a lesser extent in the German diaspora worldwide (e.g. [SEP] [CLS] Plautdietsch). [SEP] [CLS] Low German is most closely related to Frisian and English, with which it forms the North Sea Germanic group of the West Germanic languages. [SEP] [CLS] Like Dutch, it is spoken north of the Benrath and Uerdingen isoglosses, while (Standard) German is spoken south of those lines. [SEP] [CLS] Like Frisian, English, Dutch and the North Germanic languages, Low German has not undergone the High German consonant shift, as opposed to German, which is based upon High German dialects. [SEP] [CLS] Low German evolved from Old Saxon (Old Low German), which is most closely related to Old Frisian and Old English (Anglo-Saxon). [SEP] [CLS] The Low German dialects spoken in the Netherlands are mostly referred to as Low Saxon, those spoken in northwestern Germany (Lower Saxony, Westphalia, Schleswig-Holstein, Hamburg, Bremen, and Saxony-Anhalt west of the Elbe) as either Low German or Low Saxon, and those spoken in northeastern Germany (Mecklenburg-Western Pomerania, Brandenburg, and Saxony-Anhalt east of the Elbe) mostly as Low German. [SEP] [CLS] This is because northwestern Germany and the northeastern Netherlands were the area of settlement of the Saxons (Old Saxony), while Low German spread to northeastern Germany through eastward migration of Low German speakers into areas with a Slavic-speaking population (Germania Slavica). [SEP] [CLS] It has been estimated that Low German has approximately 2–5 million speakers in Germany, primarily Northern Germany, and 1.7 million in the Netherlands. [SEP] [CLS] A 2005 study by H. [SEP] [CLS] Bloemhof, Taaltelling Nedersaksisch, showed 1.8 million spoke it daily to some extent in the Netherlands. [SEP] [CLS]
