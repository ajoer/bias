The Great Malvern tornado of 1761 occurred on Wednesday, 14 October 1761 in the vicinity of Great Malvern, Worcestershire, in England. [CLS] [SEP] It was described as follows: At a quarter past four in the afternoon, a most astonishing phaenomen was seen at Great Malvern, in Worcestershire, and parts adjacent. [CLS] [SEP] It had the appearance of a volcano, and was attended with a noise as if 100 forges had been at work at once; it filled the air with a nausseous sulpherous smell; it rose from the mountains in the form of a prodigious thick smoak, and proceeded to the valleys, where it rose and fell several times; and at length it subsided in a turnep-field, where the leaves of the turneps, leaves of the trees, dirt, sticks, &c. [CLS] [SEP] filled the air and flew higher than the highest hills. [CLS] [SEP] It was preceded with the most dreadful storm of thunder and lightning ever heard in the memory of man, and spread an universal consternation, wherever it was seen or heard. [CLS] [SEP]
