[CLS] Ruzi Ying (Chinese: 孺子嬰; pinyin: Rúzi Yīng; lit.: 'Infant Ying'; 5 – 25 CE), personal name Liu Ying (劉嬰), was the last ruler of the Chinese Western Han Dynasty. [SEP] [CLS] He was the titular ruler of the Han Empire from 6 CE to 9 CE, even though he did not officially ascend to the throne and only assumed the title of crown prince. [SEP] [CLS] After Emperor Ai and Emperor Ping died without heirs, Wang Mang chose the youngest of the available successors in order to maintain his power in the government. [SEP] [CLS] The child Ying was soon deposed by Wang Mang who declared the Xin dynasty in place of the Han. [SEP] [CLS] During the Xin Dynasty, Ying was under effective house arrest—so much so that as an adult, he did not even know the names of common animals. [SEP] [CLS] Before and after the Xin Dynasty was overthrown in 23 CE, a number of ambitious individuals claimed to be restoring the Han dynasty. [SEP] [CLS] In 25 CE, a rebellion against the Gengshi Emperor used the former Emperor Ruzi as a focus, and when the rebellion was defeated, Liu Ying (Ruzi) was killed. [SEP] [CLS] He is often viewed as an innocent child who was the victim of tragic circumstances. [SEP] [CLS]
