Tropical Storm Christine was the easternmost forming Atlantic tropical cyclone on record. [CLS] [SEP] Forming as a tropical depression over the country of Guinea on August 25, 1973, the system tracked nearly due west for several days before intensifying into a tropical storm on August 28. [CLS] [SEP] However, the National Hurricane Center did not issue their first advisory on the system until its intensity was confirmed by a reconnaissance aircraft on August 30. [CLS] [SEP] Turning slightly northward, Christine gradually intensified, attaining its peak strength on September 2. [CLS] [SEP] At that time, the storm had winds of 70 mph (110 km/h) and a minimum pressure of 996 mbar (hPa; 29.41 inHg), just below hurricane status. [CLS] [SEP] Shortly after, increasing wind shear caused the system to quickly weaken. [CLS] [SEP] By September 4, Christine had been downgraded to a tropical depression as it tracked through the Leeward Islands. [CLS] [SEP] After degenerating into a tropical wave, the cyclone's remnants fully dissipated on September 6. [CLS] [SEP] Although Christine had weakened to a tropical depression by the time it passed through the Leeward Islands, heavy rains from the storm, peaking at 11.74 in (298 mm), caused flooding in Puerto Rico. [CLS] [SEP] Over 600 homes were flooded and dozens of families had to be evacuated from several towns. [CLS] [SEP] One person died from electrocution after stepping on a downed wire on a flooded street. [CLS] [SEP] Minor damage was recorded in the Virgin Islands, mainly downed power lines which left roughly 500 people without telephone service. [CLS] [SEP]
