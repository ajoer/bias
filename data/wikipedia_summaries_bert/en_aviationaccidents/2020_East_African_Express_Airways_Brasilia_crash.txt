The 2020 East African Express Airways Brasilia crash was an aviation accident involving an East African Express Airways Embraer EMB 120 Brasilia that was on approach to Berdale on a chartered cargo flight from Baidoa Airport, Somalia on 4 May 2020 when it was allegedly shot down by ground troops of the Ethiopian National Defense Force. [CLS] [SEP] All 6 occupants, including four non-revenue passengers and two crew, were killed. [CLS] [SEP] The plane was carrying medical supplies to assist with the COVID-19 pandemic in Somalia, as well as mosquito nets.According to a one-page African Union peacekeeping force incident report that was leaked on Twitter on 10 May, Ethiopian troops not affiliated with the peacekeeping mission fired on the aircraft because it made a non-standard approach from the west instead of the east, and it exhibited an irregular flight path, leading the troops to conclude that it may be engaged in a suicide attack; the report cited a "lack of communication and awareness" by the Ethiopian troops. [CLS] [SEP] However, officials emphasized that the report contains readily apparent contradictions and factual errors, and that the peacekeeping force lacks the expertise to conclusively determine the cause of the crash; a joint accident investigation by officials from Somalia, Ethiopia and Kenya is underway, with preliminary findings expected in 45 days. [CLS] [SEP] In addition to investigating the crash itself, Somali leaders questioned why Ethiopian troops outside the authority of the peacekeeping force were conducting armed operations in Somalia; there has been a history of controversial unauthorized incursions into Somalia by Ethiopian and Kenyan troops pursuing Al-Shabaab militants.
