[CLS] The 2009 Australian dust storm, also known as the Eastern Australian dust storm, was a dust storm that swept across the Australian states of New South Wales and Queensland from 22 to 24 September 2009. [SEP] [CLS] The capital, Canberra, experienced the dust storm on 22 September, and on 23 September the storm reached Sydney and Brisbane.

[SEP] [CLS] On 23 September, the dust plume measured more than 500 kilometres (310 mi) in width and 1,000 kilometres (620 mi) in length and covered dozens of towns and cities in two states. [SEP] [CLS] By 24 September, analysis using MODIS at NASA measured the distance from the northern edge at Cape York to the southern edge of the plume to be 3,450 km. [SEP] [CLS] While the cloud was visible from space, on the ground the intense red-orange colour and drop in temperature drew comparisons with nuclear winter, Armageddon, and the planet Mars.The dust storm was described by the Bureau of Meteorology as a "pretty incredible event" that was the worst in the state of New South Wales in nearly 70 years. [SEP] [CLS] The phenomenon was reported around the world. [SEP] [CLS] The Weather Channel's Richard Whitaker said: "This is unprecedented. [SEP] [CLS] We are seeing earth, wind and fire together".
