[CLS] Severe Tropical Cyclone Wilma was a powerful tropical cyclone that affected the Samoan Islands, Tonga and New Zealand. [SEP] [CLS] Forming out of a trough of low pressure on 19 January 2011 to the northwest of Fiji, Cyclone Wilma initially tracked eastward towards the Samoan Islands. [SEP] [CLS] On 22 January, the system took a sharp southward turn, bringing its centre directly over American Samoa the following day. [SEP] [CLS] After turning towards the southwest and accelerating, Wilma steadily intensified into a severe tropical cyclone before striking Tonga. [SEP] [CLS] The storm reached its peak intensity on 26 January as a Category 4 cyclone with winds of 185 km/h (115 mph) and a barometric pressure of 930 mbar (hPa; 27.46 inHg). [SEP] [CLS] Gradually re-curving towards the southeast, Wilma weakened quickly as it moved over cooler sea surface temperatures; by 28 January, it was downgraded to a tropical cyclone. [SEP] [CLS] Later that day, the storm brushed the North Island of New Zealand before transitioning into an extratropical cyclone. [SEP] [CLS] Throughout Wilma's path, three countries were affected, with New Zealand experiencing the most severe damage. [SEP] [CLS] At least three fatalities in American Samoa have been blamed on the storm, two from flooding and one from high seas. [SEP] [CLS] In Tonga, "major damage" was reported across the Ha'apai Islands. [SEP] [CLS] In New Zealand, several homes were destroyed by the storm and hundreds of people were evacuated. [SEP] [CLS] However, there were no reports of fatalities. [SEP] [CLS] Torrential rain in the country, exceeding 280 mm (11 in) in some places, triggered 50-year flood events and isolated towns.
