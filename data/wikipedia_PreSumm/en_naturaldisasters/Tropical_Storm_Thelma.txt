[CLS] Tropical Storm Thelma, known in the Philippines as Tropical Storm Uring, was one of the deadliest tropical cyclones in Philippine history, killing at least 5,081 people. [SEP] [CLS] Forming out of a tropical disturbance on November 1, 1991, several hundred kilometers north-northeast of Palau, the depression that would become Thelma tracked generally westward. [SEP] [CLS] After turning southwestward in response to a cold front, the system intensified into a tropical storm on November 4 as it approached the Philippines. [SEP] [CLS] Hours before moving over the Visayas, Thelma attained its peak intensity with estimated ten-minute sustained winds of 75 km/h (45 mph) and a barometric pressure of 992 mbar (hPa; 29.29 inHg). [SEP] [CLS] Despite moving over land, the system weakened only slightly, emerging over the South China Sea on November 6 while retaining gale-force winds. [SEP] [CLS] Thelma ultimately succumbed to wind shear and degraded to a tropical depression. [SEP] [CLS] On November 8, the depression made landfall in Southern Vietnam before dissipating hours later. [SEP] [CLS] While passing over the Philippines, Thelma's interaction with the high terrain of some of the islands resulted in torrential rainfall. [SEP] [CLS] Through the process of orographic lift, much of the Visayas received 150 mm (6 in) of rain; however, on Leyte Island there was a localized downpour that brought totals to 580.5 mm (22.85 in). [SEP] [CLS] With the majority of this falling in a three-hour span, an unprecedented flash flood took place on the island. [SEP] [CLS] Much of the land had been deforestated or poorly cultivated and was unable to absorb most of the rain, creating a large runoff. [SEP] [CLS] This water overwhelmed the Anilao–Malbasag watershed and rushed downstream. [SEP] [CLS] Ormoc City, located past where the Anilao and Malbasag rivers converge, suffered the brunt of the flood. [SEP] [CLS] In just three hours, the city was devastated with thousands of homes damaged or destroyed. [SEP] [CLS] A total of 4,922 people were killed in the city alone, with 2,300 perishing along the riverbank. [SEP] [CLS] Outside of Ormoc City, 159 people were killed across Leyte and Negros Occidental. [SEP] [CLS] Throughout the country, at least 5,081 people lost their lives while another 1,941–3,084 were missing and presumed dead. [SEP] [CLS] This made Thelma the deadliest tropical cyclone in Philippine history, surpassing a storm in 1867 that killed 1,800, until later surpassed by Typhoon Haiyan (Yolanda) in 2013 which killed at least 6,300 people. [SEP] [CLS] A total of 4,446 homes were destroyed while another 22,229 were damaged. [SEP] [CLS] Total losses amounted to $27.67 million. [SEP] [CLS] Initially, it took over 24 hours for word of the disaster to reach officials due to a crippled communication network around Ormoc City. [SEP] [CLS] Within a few days, emergency supply centers were established and aid from various agencies under the United Nations and several countries flowed into the country. [SEP] [CLS] A total of $5.8 million worth of grants and materials was provided collectively in the international relief effort. [SEP] [CLS]
