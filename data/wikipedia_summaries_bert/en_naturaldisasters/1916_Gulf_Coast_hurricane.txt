[CLS] The 1916 Gulf Coast hurricane was a destructive tropical cyclone that struck the central Gulf Coast of the United States in early July 1916. [SEP] [CLS] It generated the highest storm surge on record in Mobile, Alabama, wrought widespread havoc on shipping, and dropped torrential rainfall exceeding 2 ft (0.6 m). [SEP] [CLS] The second tropical cyclone, first hurricane, and first major hurricane – Category 3 or stronger on the modern-day Saffir–Simpson scale – of the highly active 1916 Atlantic hurricane season, the system originated in the southwestern Caribbean Sea on June 28 and moved generally toward the north-northwest. [SEP] [CLS] Crossing the Yucatán Channel on July 3 as a strengthening hurricane and brushing Cuba with gusty winds, the cyclone reached its peak intensity with maximum sustained winds of 120 mph (195 km/h) prior to making landfall near Pascagoula, Mississippi, at 20:00 UTC on July 5. [SEP] [CLS] Over land, the hurricane rapidly weakened to a tropical storm, but then retained much of its remaining strength as it meandered across interior Mississippi and Alabama for several days, its northward progress impeded by a sprawling high-pressure area to the north. [SEP] [CLS] The system weakened into a tropical depression on July 9 and dissipated late the next day over southern Tennessee. [SEP] [CLS] The United States Weather Bureau first took notice of the developing storm on July 2, issuing tropical cyclone watches and warnings for much of the central Gulf Coast on July 4 and 5. [SEP] [CLS] Upon moving ashore, the cyclone produced sustained Category 3 winds over coastal Mississippi and Alabama, with the worst damage mainly confined to east of the storm's center. [SEP] [CLS] In Mobile, an 11.6 ft (3.5 m) storm surge destroyed wharves and severely flooded the business district, while high winds unroofed or otherwise damaged many buildings. [SEP] [CLS] Boats of all sizes in Mobile Bay were sunk or blown ashore, and despite efforts to prepare warehouses for the tidal flooding, $500,000 in merchandise was lost. [SEP] [CLS] Farther east, Pensacola, Florida, endured several days of gale-force winds after the initial passage of the storm's core; though wind damage to homes, businesses, and trees was extensive, the worst damage resulted from storm tides along the immediate coast. [SEP] [CLS] Throughout the region, the hurricane severed telephone and telegraph communications. [SEP] [CLS] Numerous ships were lost in the Gulf of Mexico, some with their entire crews. [SEP] [CLS] As the storm slowly proceeded inland, days of downpours caused rivers to rise precipitously from Mississippi to Georgia, overflowing their banks for several miles in each direction; the Chattahoochee River exceeded flood stage by 23.7 ft (7.2 m). [SEP] [CLS] In Alabama alone, 350,000 acres (140,000 ha) of farmland was submerged, leading to millions of dollars in crop damage. [SEP] [CLS] Railroads were flooded, washed out, or blocked by debris, and many sawmills and other industrial facilities were disrupted. [SEP] [CLS] In addition, the hurricane's outer bands spawned multiple tornadoes that each caused severe but localized damage to residential areas. [SEP] [CLS] Steady rainfall in western North Carolina primed the French Broad River watershed for a catastrophic flooding event when another hurricane from the Atlantic coast moved over the same area just days later. [SEP] [CLS] The resulting disaster, the worst in Asheville, North Carolina's history, killed 80 people. [SEP] [CLS] Including property damage, shipping losses, and crop failures, the hurricane cost the Gulf Coast about $12.5 million, and at least 34 people died in the region. [SEP] [CLS]
