The 1703 Apennine earthquakes were a sequence of three earthquakes of magnitude â‰¥6 that occurred in the central Apennines of Italy, over a period of 19 days. [CLS] [SEP] The epicenters were near Norcia (14 January), Montereale (16 January) and L'Aquila (2 February), showing a southwards progression over about 36 km. [CLS] [SEP] These events involved all of the known active faults between Norcia and L'Aquila. [CLS] [SEP] A total of about 10,000 people are estimated to have died as a result of these earthquakes, although because of the overlap in areas affected by the three events, casualty numbers remain highly uncertain.
