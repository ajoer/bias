The 1979 Imperial Valley earthquake occurred at 16:16 Pacific Daylight Time (23:16 UTC) on 15 October just south of the Mexicoâ€“United States border. [CLS] [SEP] It affected Imperial Valley in Southern California and Mexicali Valley in northern Baja California. [CLS] [SEP] The earthquake had a relatively shallow hypocenter and caused property damage in the United States estimated at US$30 million. [CLS] [SEP] The irrigation systems in the Imperial Valley were badly affected, but no deaths occurred. [CLS] [SEP] It was the largest earthquake to occur in the contiguous United States since the 1971 San Fernando earthquake eight years earlier. [CLS] [SEP] The earthquake was 6.5 on the Mw scale, with a maximum perceived intensity of IX (Violent) on the Mercalli intensity scale. [CLS] [SEP] However, most of the intensity measurements were consistent with an overall maximum intensity of VII (Very strong), and only the damage to a single structure, the Imperial County Services building in El Centro, was judged to be of intensity IX. [CLS] [SEP] Several comprehensive studies on the total structural failure of this building were conducted with a focus on how the building responded to the earthquake's vibration. [CLS] [SEP] It was one of the first heavily instrumented office buildings to be severely damaged by seismic forces. [CLS] [SEP] The Imperial Valley is surrounded by a number of interconnected fault systems and is vulnerable to both moderate and strong earthquakes as well as earthquake swarms. [CLS] [SEP] The area was equipped with an array of strong motion seismographs for analyzing the fault mechanisms of nearby earthquakes and seismic characteristics of the sediments in the valley. [CLS] [SEP] The earthquake was significant in the scientific community for studies of both fault mechanics and repeat events. [CLS] [SEP] Four of the region's known strike-slip faults and one additional newly discovered normal fault all broke the surface during the earthquake. [CLS] [SEP]
