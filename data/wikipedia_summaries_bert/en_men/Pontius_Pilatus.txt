[CLS] Pontius Pilate (Latin: Pontius Pīlātus [ˈpɔntɪ.ʊs piːˈlaːtʊs]; Ancient Greek: Πόντιος Πιλάτος, Póntios Pilátos) was the fifth governor of the Roman province of Judaea, serving under Emperor Tiberius from 26/27 to 36/37 CE. [SEP] [CLS] He is best known today for being the official who presided over the trial of Jesus and ordered his crucifixion. [SEP] [CLS] Pilate's importance in modern Christianity is underscored by his prominent place in both the Apostles' and Nicene Creeds. [SEP] [CLS] Due to the Gospels' portrayal of Pilate as reluctant to execute Jesus, the Coptic and Ethiopian Churches believe that Pilate became a Christian and have venerated him as a martyr and saint.Although Pilate is the best-attested governor of Judaea, few sources on his rule have survived. [SEP] [CLS] He appears to have belonged to the well-attested Pontii family of Samnite origin, but nothing is known for certain about his life before he became governor of Judaea, nor of the circumstances that led to his appointment to the governorship. [SEP] [CLS] A single inscription from Pilate's governorship has survived, the so-called Pilate stone, as have coins that he minted. [SEP] [CLS] The Jewish historian Josephus and philosopher Philo of Alexandria both mention incidents of tension and violence between the Jewish population and Pilate's administration. [SEP] [CLS] Many of these involve Pilate acting in ways that offended the religious sensibilities of the Jews. [SEP] [CLS] The Christian Gospels record that Pilate ordered the crucifixion of Jesus at some point during his time in office; Josephus and the Roman historian Tacitus also appear to have recorded this information. [SEP] [CLS] According to Josephus, Pilate's removal from office occurred because he violently suppressed an armed Samaritan movement at Mount Gerizim. [SEP] [CLS] He was sent back to Rome by the legate of Syria to answer for this before Tiberius, who, however, had died before he arrived. [SEP] [CLS] Nothing is known for certain about what happened to him after this. [SEP] [CLS] On the basis of a mention in the second-century pagan philosopher Celsus and Christian apologist Origen, most modern historians believe that Pilate simply retired after his dismissal. [SEP] [CLS] Modern historians have differing assessments of Pilate as an effective ruler; while some believe he was a particularly brutal and ineffective governor, others argue that his long time in office means he must have been reasonably competent. [SEP] [CLS] According to one prominent post-war theory, Pilate was motivated by antisemitism in his treatment of the Jews, but this theory has been mostly abandoned.In Late Antiquity and the Early Middle Ages, Pilate became the focus of a large group of New Testament apocrypha expanding on his role in the Gospels. [SEP] [CLS] In many of these, particularly the earlier texts from the Eastern Roman Empire, Pilate was portrayed as a positive figure. [SEP] [CLS] In some, he became a Christian martyr. [SEP] [CLS] In later, particularly Western Christian texts, he was instead portrayed as a negative figure and villain, with traditions surrounding his death by suicide featuring prominently. [SEP] [CLS] Pilate was also the focus of numerous medieval legends, which invented a complete biography for him and portrayed him as villainous and cowardly. [SEP] [CLS] Many of these legends connected Pilate's place of birth or death to particular locations around Western Europe. [SEP] [CLS] Pilate has frequently been a subject of artistic representation. [SEP] [CLS] Medieval art frequently portrayed scenes of Pilate and Jesus, often in the scene where he washes his hands of guilt for Jesus's death. [SEP] [CLS] In the art of the Late Middle Ages and the Renaissance, Pilate is often depicted as a Jew. [SEP] [CLS] The nineteenth century saw a renewed interest in depicting Pilate, with numerous images made. [SEP] [CLS] He plays an important role in medieval passion plays, where he is often a more prominent character than Jesus. [SEP] [CLS] His characterization in these plays varies greatly, from weak-willed and coerced into crucifying Jesus to being an evil person who demands Jesus's crucifixion. [SEP] [CLS] Modern authors who feature Pilate prominently in their works include Anatole France, Mikhail Bulgakov, and Chingiz Aitmatov, with a majority of modern treatments of Pilate dating to after the Second World War. [SEP] [CLS] Pilate has also frequently been portrayed in film. [SEP] [CLS]
