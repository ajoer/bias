[CLS] The 1946 Florida hurricane also known as the 1946 Tampa Bay hurricane was the last hurricane to make direct landfall in the Tampa Bay Area of the U.S. [SEP] [CLS] state of Florida to date. [SEP] [CLS] Forming on October 5 from the complex interactions of several weather systems over the southern Caribbean Sea, the storm rapidly strengthened before striking western Cuba. [SEP] [CLS] After entering the Gulf of Mexico, it peaked with winds corresponding to Category 2 status on the modern-day Saffirâ€“Simpson Hurricane Scale; however, it quickly weakened before approaching Florida. [SEP] [CLS] It made landfall south of St. [SEP] [CLS] Petersburg and continued to weaken as it proceeded inland. [SEP] [CLS] Its remnants persisted for several days longer. [SEP] [CLS] In advance of the storm, preparations were taken along threatened areas of coastal Florida (mainly the Tampa Bay Area), including the evacuation of thousands of residents. [SEP] [CLS] Damage was extensive in Cuba, and five people were killed there. [SEP] [CLS] The cyclone's effects in the United States were minor to moderate, and the most significant impact was to citrus crops. [SEP] [CLS] No deaths occurred in the country, although high tides caused some flooding of low-lying terrain. [SEP] [CLS] The cyclone's structure was extensively observed and investigated.
