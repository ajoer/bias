[CLS] Severe Tropical Cyclone John was an intense tropical cyclone that rapidly deepened offshore before devastating areas of Western Australia. [SEP] [CLS] The system was the second cyclone and first severe tropical cyclone of the active 1999–00 Australian region cyclone season. [SEP] [CLS] Cyclone John developed from a monsoon trough positioned northwest of Australia on 9 December 1999. [SEP] [CLS] As it moved to the west and later south as the result of a subtropical ridge under favourable conditions, the cyclone was able to rapidly intensify. [SEP] [CLS] John reached peak intensity on 14 December as a Category 5 cyclone on the Australian cyclone scale, the highest rating possible. [SEP] [CLS] Cyclone John later began interacting with a mid–latitude trough, which slightly weakened the cyclone prior to making landfall near Whim Creek early on 15 December. [SEP] [CLS] Increasingly unfavourable conditions further inland resulted in the cyclone's rapid weakening, before it dissipated during the next day. [SEP] [CLS] Cyclone John extensively affected areas of Western Australia, but damage was not as bad as expected. [SEP] [CLS] Widespread power outages across the Pilbara region were caused by John. [SEP] [CLS] Strong winds caused minor damage to infrastructure across the coast, as well as tree damage. [SEP] [CLS] 140 windmills were destroyed by the cyclone on the coast. [SEP] [CLS] Further inland, rainfall associated with the cyclone and its remnants brought flooding, which flooded 25 houses and caused rivers to overflow. [SEP] [CLS] The system was responsible for no deaths and a limited amount of damage. [SEP] [CLS] After the season, the name John was retired from the Australian tropical cyclone naming list.
