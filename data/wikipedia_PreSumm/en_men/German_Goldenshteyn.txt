[CLS] German Goldenshteyn, or Goldenshtayn (2 September 1934 – June 10, 2006) was a Romanian-born American klezmer musician. [SEP] [CLS] Goldenshteyn was born in the Bessarabian shtetl of Otaci, then in Romania, now in Moldova. [SEP] [CLS] He was a clarinetist and musicologist who brought his native region's klezmer tradition to the USA. [SEP] [CLS] In 1994 he arrived with nearly a thousand klezmer tunes that he had transcribed over the years. [SEP] [CLS] Goldenshteyn was a featured performer in the Center for Traditional Music and Dance's Soviet Jewish project called "Nashi Traditsii" or "Our Tradition" between 1998 and 2002. [SEP] [CLS] He also appeared at workshops organised by the New England Conservatory of Music and Poland's Borderland Foundation. [SEP] [CLS] "You felt it in his playing, in his presence, in his whole being, that he was a bridge to — a repository of — this entire culture," Michael Alpert, another klezmer musician and musicologist, told The New York Times. [SEP] [CLS] "He's the closest thing that the klezmer revival has had to a Woody Guthrie or a Lead Belly." He recorded a CD of his music in December 2005 at Klezkamp, backed up by a group of notable younger klezmorim. [SEP] [CLS] Another CD recorded separately is planned for release. [SEP] [CLS] Goldenshteyn died of a heart attack in Long Island, New York in 2006. [SEP] [CLS] He was 71 years old. [SEP] [CLS]
