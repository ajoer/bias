Typhoon Nanmadol, known in the Philippines as Typhoon Yoyong, was the last of four consecutive tropical cyclones to strike the Philippines in 2004. [CLS] [SEP] A quickly moving system, Nanmadol brought heavy rainfall and strong winds over the same regions impacted by the previous storms, exacerbating flood conditions in Luzon and surrounding regions. [CLS] [SEP] Together Nanmadol and these systems accounted for around 1,000 deaths in the Philippines. [CLS] [SEP] The typhoon later became the first December tropical cyclone to strike Taiwan since record keeping began, bringing along with it heavy rain, which also affected nearby regions of eastern China. [CLS] [SEP] As an extratropical storm, Nanmadol brought gusty winds and rain to Japan. [CLS] [SEP] Nanmadol developed from an isolated area of convection south-southwest of Pohnpei that became classified as a tropical depression on November 28. [CLS] [SEP] Within highly conducive conditions for development, the system reached tropical storm intensity the following day, followed by typhoon intensity on November 30. [CLS] [SEP] Quickly pacing towards the north-northwest about the periphery of a nearby subtropical ridge, Nanmadol reached its peak intensity on December 1 with winds of 165 km/h (105 mph) and a minimum barometric pressure of 935 mbar (hPa; 27.61 inHg). [CLS] [SEP] Shortly after, the typhoon made landfall at a similar intensity on Casiguran, Aurora, quickly moving over Luzon before reaching the South China Sea, where it recurved northward into hostile atmospheric conditions. [CLS] [SEP] Over the next few days, Nanmadol weakened and later transitioned into an extratropical cyclone near Taiwan on December 4, whereafter it merged with another extratopical system. [CLS] [SEP] With the typhoon approaching landfall in an area still recovering from previous storms, relief agencies already servicing the region were forced to allocate additional resources to prepare for Nanmadol. [CLS] [SEP] Evacuation efforts assisted in moving almost 100,000 people into shelters. [CLS] [SEP] Effects from Nanmadol were most severe in Cagayan Valley, where 14 people were killed. [CLS] [SEP] Power outages were widespread across several islands. [CLS] [SEP] Overall, damage from the typhoon in the Philippines totaled ₱2.23 billion (US$39.3 million). [CLS] [SEP] Heavy rainfall, peaking at 1,090 mm (43 in), was documented in Taiwan. [CLS] [SEP] Agricultural damage in Taiwan alone reached NT$670 million (US$20.8 million). [CLS] [SEP] Similar effects were felt in Japan, where the remnants of Nanmadol produced record-breaking rainfall and wind. [CLS] [SEP] Damage was particularly significant in Aichi Prefecture, totaling JP¥69.8 million (US$680,000). [CLS] [SEP] Overall, Nanmadol resulted in 77 fatalities and US$60.8 million in damage across three countries. [CLS] [SEP]
