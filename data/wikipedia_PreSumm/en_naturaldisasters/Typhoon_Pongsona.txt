[CLS] Typhoon Pongsona was the last typhoon of the 2002 Pacific typhoon season, and was the second costliest United States disaster in 2002, only behind Hurricane Lili. [SEP] [CLS] The name "Pongsona" was contributed by North Korea for the Pacific tropical cyclone list and is the Korean name for the garden balsam. [SEP] [CLS] Pongsona developed out of an area of disturbed weather on December 2, and steadily intensified to reach typhoon status on December 5. [SEP] [CLS] On December 8 it passed through Guam and the Northern Mariana Islands while near its peak winds of 175 km/h (110 mph 10-min). [SEP] [CLS] It ultimately turned to the northeast, weakened, and became extratropical on December 11. [SEP] [CLS] Typhoon Pongsona produced strong wind gusts peaking at 290km/h (183 mph 1-min), which left the entire island of Guam without power and destroyed about 1,300 houses. [SEP] [CLS] With strong building standards and experience from repeated typhoon strikes, there were no fatalities directly related to Pongsona, although there was one indirect death from flying glass. [SEP] [CLS] Damage on the island totaled over $730 million (2002 USD, $1.04 billion 2020 USD), making Pongsona among the five costliest typhoons on the island. [SEP] [CLS] The typhoon also caused heavy damage on Rota and elsewhere in the Northern Mariana Islands, and as a result of its impact the name was retired. [SEP] [CLS]
