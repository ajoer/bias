The 2004 Indian Ocean earthquake and tsunami (also known as the Boxing Day Tsunami and, by the scientific community, the Sumatra–Andaman earthquake) occurred at 07:58:53 in local time (UTC+7) on 26 December, with an epicentre off the west coast of northern Sumatra, Indonesia. [CLS] [SEP] It was an undersea megathrust earthquake that registered a magnitude of 9.1–9.3 Mw, reaching a Mercalli intensity up to IX in certain areas. [CLS] [SEP] The earthquake was caused by a rupture along the fault between the Burma Plate and the Indian Plate. [CLS] [SEP] A series of massive tsunami waves grew up to 30 m (100 ft) high once heading inland, after being created by the underwater seismic activity offshore. [CLS] [SEP] Communities along the surrounding coasts of the Indian Ocean were severely affected, and the tsunamis killed an estimated 227,898 people in 14 countries, making it one of the deadliest natural disasters in recorded history. [CLS] [SEP] The direct results caused major disruptions to living conditions and commerce in coastal provinces of surrounded countries, including Aceh, Indonesia, Sri Lanka, Tamil Nadu, India and Khao Lak, Thailand. [CLS] [SEP] Banda Aceh reported the largest number of deaths. [CLS] [SEP] The earthquake was the third-largest ever recorded and had the longest duration of faulting ever observed; between eight and ten minutes. [CLS] [SEP] It caused the planet to vibrate as much as 10 mm (0.4 in), and also remotely triggered earthquakes as far away as Alaska. [CLS] [SEP] Its epicentre was between Simeulue and mainland Sumatra. [CLS] [SEP] The plight of the affected people and countries prompted a worldwide humanitarian response, with donations totalling more than US$14 billion. [CLS] [SEP]
