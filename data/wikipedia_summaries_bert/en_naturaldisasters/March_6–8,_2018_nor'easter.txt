The March 6â€“8, 2018 nor'easter was a powerful nor'easter that wreaked havoc on the Northeastern United States just days after another intense nor'easter struck the Mid-Atlantic, hampering recovery efforts from that storm. [CLS] [SEP] Forming on March 2 and reaching the Outer Banks late on March 6, as the end phase of a long-tracked winter storm across the country, it rapidly deepened off the Mid-Atlantic coast on March 7 and brought up to 3 feet (36 in) of heavy snow, whiteout conditions, and even coastal flooding (though nowhere near the levels seen in the prior nor'easter) to those in the impact zone from the storm, many of whom were still without power from the previous storm less than a week prior. [CLS] [SEP] The storm caused up to 1 million people to lose power, and at least two people were confirmed dead due to the storm by March 7. [CLS] [SEP] Hundreds of flights were cancelled across the region, and many schools closed due to the nor'easter, although some opted to remain open, such as those in New York City, causing controversy. [CLS] [SEP] Many freeways were also closed in the regions, and several states were put under state of emergencies. [CLS] [SEP]
