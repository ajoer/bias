[CLS] Hurricane Fico was the longest-lived hurricane of the 1978 Pacific hurricane season and became the longest-lasting Pacific hurricane on record, a record broken by Hurricane Tina fourteen years later. [SEP] [CLS] The sixth tropical storm, fourth hurricane, and third major hurricane, Fico developed from a tropical disturbance off the Pacific coast of Mexico on July 9. [SEP] [CLS] It moved northwestward and then westward, quickly reaching peak winds of 140 mph (220 km/h) on July 12. [SEP] [CLS] Moving nearly due westward, the intensity of Fico fluctuated from Category 1 to Category 4 status on the Saffirâ€“Simpson hurricane scale for the following days, and it passed about 170 miles (275 km) south of Hawaii on July 20 with winds of 115 mph (185 km/h). [SEP] [CLS] Fico slowly weakened as it turned to the northwest over cooler waters, and became an extratropical cyclone on July 28 to the northeast of Midway Island. [SEP] [CLS] Swells from Fico, combined with swells from a storm in the Southern Hemisphere, produced rough surf throughout the Hawaiian islands. [SEP] [CLS] The surf destroyed one house and resulted in considerable damage along the southern coast of the island of Hawaii. [SEP] [CLS] No deaths were reported, and damage totaled $200,000 (1978 USD, $619,000 2006 USD). [SEP] [CLS]
