The 1973 Atlantic hurricane season was the first season to use the Saffirâ€“Simpson hurricane scale, a scale developed in 1971 by Herbert Saffir and Robert Simpson to rate the intensity of tropical cyclones. [CLS] [SEP] The season produced 24 tropical and subtropical cyclones, of which only 8 reached storm intensity, 4 became hurricanes, and only 1 reached major hurricane status. [CLS] [SEP] Although more active than the 1972 season, 1973 brought few storms of note. [CLS] [SEP] Nearly half of the season's storms affected land, one of which resulted in severe damage. [CLS] [SEP] The season officially began on June 1, 1973, and lasted until November 30, 1973. [CLS] [SEP] These dates conventionally delimit the period of each year when most tropical cyclones form in the Atlantic basin. [CLS] [SEP] However, the first system formed on April 18, more than a month before the official start. [CLS] [SEP] Three more depressions formed before June 1; however, none attained storm intensity. [CLS] [SEP] The first named storm of the year was Hurricane Alice which formed on July 1 and became the first known cyclone to affect Bermuda during July. [CLS] [SEP] More than a month later, the second hurricane, Brenda, formed and was considered the worst storm to strike Mexico along the eastern coast of the Bay of Campeche, killing 10 people. [CLS] [SEP] Later in August, Tropical Storm Christine became the easternmost forming tropical cyclone on record when it formed over Guinea. [CLS] [SEP] The most intense storm of the season was Hurricane Ellen, a Category 3 cyclone that remained over open water. [CLS] [SEP] The final named storm was meteorologically significant in that it became the first recorded tropical cyclone to transition into a subtropical cyclone. [CLS] [SEP] No names were retired during the season; however, due to the addition of male names into the list of Atlantic hurricane names in 1979, several of the names were removed and have not been used since.
