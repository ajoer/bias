Northwest Airlines Flight 1, registration NC17389, was a Lockheed 14H Super Electra aircraft which crashed approximately ½ mile southwest of the Miles City, Montana airport on January 13, 1939. [CLS] [SEP] All four on board were killed in the accident. [CLS] [SEP] Flight 1 normally originated in Chicago, Illinois, and ended in Seattle, Washington, via the intermediate stops Minneapolis, Minnesota; Fargo, North Dakota; Bismarck, North Dakota; Miles City, Montana; Billings, Montana; Butte, Montana; and Spokane, Washington. [CLS] [SEP] On the date of the accident, the flight actually began in Minneapolis and departed at 4:00 PM local time. [CLS] [SEP] The flight reached Miles City, Montana, at 7:41 PM Mountain time to refuel and take on cargo. [CLS] [SEP] Takeoff from Miles City Municipal Airport was delayed for over an hour due to weather conditions at Billings, but the aircraft eventually departed at 9:14 PM with only two passengers on board. [CLS] [SEP] Shortly after takeoff, and at an altitude of five hundred feet above ground level (AGL), the aircraft began a short turn to the left, lost altitude rapidly, and descended almost to the ground. [CLS] [SEP] It then pulled up into a sharp climb, reached about 500 feet AGL again, turned left again and descended rapidly into a ravine approximately ½ mile southwest of the field. [CLS] [SEP] Investigators with the United States Department of Commerce's Civil Aeronautics Authority (CAA), a predecessor organization to both the FAA and the NTSB, determined that an intense fire had developed in the cockpit shortly after the aircraft had departed the airport. [CLS] [SEP] Although the state of the wreckage prevented investigators from definitively pinpointing the exact origin of the fire, an area of severe burning was found close to the cross-feed fuel valve located in the cockpit between the pilot and co-pilot. [CLS] [SEP] The Super Electra's cross-feed fuel system maintained a constant pressure of approximately 4½ pounds, and there had been numerous reports of leakage in the vicinity of the valve. [CLS] [SEP] Lockheed designers had not provided any method by which any fuel that did leak from the valve could safely be drained. [CLS] [SEP] It was also difficult to maintain or inspect the valve due to its location. [CLS] [SEP] The CAA recommended that the cross-feed fuel system be relocated to allow for easier maintenance and inspection and to reduce the possibility of a cockpit fire caused by fuel leakage. [CLS] [SEP] They also recommended that areas of leakage in the fuel line be modified so as to allow for adequate drainage. [CLS] [SEP] This accident occurred almost exactly one year after Northwest Airlines Flight 2 crashed near Bozeman, Montana. [CLS] [SEP] These accidents, as well as two others which befell Northwest Airlines Super Electras in 1938, called into question the airworthiness and commercial potential of the model. [CLS] [SEP] Northwest Airlines sold off its fleet of Electras soon after this accident. [CLS] [SEP] This flight number was used for many years on Northwest Airlines' Los Angeles-Tokyo-Ho Chi Minh City route. [CLS] [SEP] But after Northwest Airlines was acquired by Delta, the "Northwest Flight 1" designation no longer existed. [CLS] [SEP]
