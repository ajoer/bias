Giorgione (UK: , US: , Italian: [dʒorˈdʒoːne]; born Giorgio Barbarelli da Castelfranco; c. [CLS] [SEP] 1477/78–1510) was an Italian painter of the Venetian school during the High Renaissance from Venice, who died in his thirties. [CLS] [SEP] Giorgione is known for the elusive poetic quality of his work, though only about six surviving paintings are firmly attributed to him. [CLS] [SEP] The uncertainty surrounding the identity and meaning of his work has made Giorgione one of the most mysterious figures in European art. [CLS] [SEP] Together with Titian, who was probably slightly younger, he founded the distinctive Venetian school of Italian Renaissance painting, which achieves much of its effect through colour and mood, and is traditionally contrasted with Florentine painting, which relies on a more linear disegno-led style.
