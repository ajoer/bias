[CLS] Hurricane Belle was a strong tropical cyclone that caused moderate damage across the East Coast of the United States in August 1976. [SEP] [CLS] In late July, a tropical wave emerged off the west coast of Africa. [SEP] [CLS] Traversing the Atlantic Ocean for more than a week, the system eventually consolidated into a tropical depression near the Bahamas on August 6. [SEP] [CLS] Remaining nearly stationary for a day, the depression strengthened into a tropical storm on August 7 and a hurricane later that day as it acquired a northwest motion. [SEP] [CLS] Formation of an eye accompanied quick intensification and Belle reached its peak the following day with winds of 120 mph (195 km/h). [SEP] [CLS] The hurricane subsequently turned north and accelerated, skirting the Outer Banks of North Carolina. [SEP] [CLS] Early on August 10, Belle made landfall on Long Island, New York, as a minimal hurricane crossing Long Island Sound and hitting the central coast of Connecticut as strong tropical storm. [SEP] [CLS] Thereafter, Belle transitioned into an extratropical cyclone over New England before moving over Atlantic Canada. [SEP] [CLS] The system turned east while over the north Atlantic and ultimately dissipated on August 15 to the south of Iceland. [SEP] [CLS] Threatening much of the East Coast of the United States, hurricane warnings were issued from Georgia to Maine. [SEP] [CLS] An estimated 500,000 people evacuated coastal areas accordingly. [SEP] [CLS] Overall, impacts from Belle were less than expected and mainly attributed to flooding across New England. [SEP] [CLS] Hundreds of thousands of residents lost power due to high winds. [SEP] [CLS] A total of 12 people lost their lives, mostly incidents indirectly related to the hurricane, and damage reached an estimated $100 million. [SEP] [CLS] Portions of New Jersey, New York, and Vermont were later declared major disaster areas by then-President Gerald Ford. [SEP] [CLS] Some damage also took place in New Brunswick, Canada, from heavy rain. [SEP] [CLS]
