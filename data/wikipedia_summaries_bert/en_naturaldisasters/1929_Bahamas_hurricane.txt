[CLS] The 1929 Bahamas hurricane (also known as the Great Andros Island Hurricane) was a high-end Category 4 tropical cyclone whose intensity and slow forward speed led to catastrophic damage in the Bahamas in September 1929, particularly on Andros and New Providence islands. [SEP] [CLS] Its erratic path and a lack of nearby weather observations made the hurricane difficult to locate and forecast. [SEP] [CLS] The storm later made two landfalls in Florida, killing eleven but causing comparatively light damage. [SEP] [CLS] Moisture from the storm led to extensive flooding over the Southeastern United States, particularly along the Savannah River. [SEP] [CLS] Across its path from the Bahamas to the mouth of the Saint Lawrence River, the hurricane killed 155 people. [SEP] [CLS] The storm's origins can be traced to tropical wave first noted near Cabo Verde on September 11, 1929. [SEP] [CLS] This tropical disturbance remained dormant as it tracked west until September 18, when an associated area of thunderstorms developed into a tropical depression northeast of Puerto Rico. [SEP] [CLS] Gradually strengthening, the depression reached tropical storm strength on September 22 and hurricane strength on September 23. [SEP] [CLS] Beginning on September 24, the storm took a slow and southwestward path through the Bahamas, passing over Nassau and Andros Island between September 25–26 with maximum sustained winds of 145 mph (230 km/h). [SEP] [CLS] This southwestward trajectory was unprecedented for the islands. [SEP] [CLS] The storm then curved west and struck the Florida Keys at Key Largo on September 28 with winds of 115 mph (185 km/h). [SEP] [CLS] Two days later, the cyclone moved ashore Apalachicola, Florida, as a minimal hurricane shortly before transitioning into an extratropical cyclone. [SEP] [CLS] This system tracked northeast along the interior of the East Coast of the United States before dissipating near the Saint Lawrence River on October 4. [SEP] [CLS] Poorly-built structures and ships were destroyed throughout the Bahamas. [SEP] [CLS] Andros Island was within the envelope of the storm's hurricane-force winds and storm surge for two days. [SEP] [CLS] Parts of the island were inundated by a 12 ft (3.7 m) surge that advanced 20 mi (32 km) inland, wiping out all crops and most fruit trees and livestock. [SEP] [CLS] A wind gust of 164 mph (264 km/h) was measured in Nassau, which also experienced the calm of the hurricane's eye for two hours. [SEP] [CLS] An estimated 73% of the city's homes and businesses sustained damage, leaving more than 5,000 people without homes. [SEP] [CLS] The hurricane was a heavy blow to the declining sponge industry on the islands. [SEP] [CLS] Following the storm, wild birds and crops were brought from the Caribbean to replenish their losses in the Bahamas. [SEP] [CLS] New building codes were enacted after the 1929 storm to prevent similarly extensive destruction. [SEP] [CLS] A 6–9 ft (1.8–2.7 m) storm surge battered the Florida Keys, washing out highways and sinking small fishing boats. [SEP] [CLS] At least five tornadoes struck Florida, representing some of the first verified reports of tornadoes caused by a tropical cyclone. [SEP] [CLS] One impacted Fort Lauderdale's business center and caused $100,000 in damage. [SEP] [CLS] The Apalachicola waterfront sustained heavy damage from the storm's final landfall, including the loss of nearly all wharves. [SEP] [CLS] Widespread flooding occurred throughout Georgia and The Carolinas due to the continuous influx of moisture from the slowly-moving hurricane. [SEP] [CLS] A maximum rainfall total of 20.0 in (510 mm) was registered in Glennville, Georgia. [SEP] [CLS] The Savannah River reached a record stage of 46.1 ft (14.1 m) at Augusta, Georgia, breaching a levee and inundating much of the surrounding floodplain. [SEP] [CLS] The damage toll in the United States totaled to at least $9.31 million. [SEP] [CLS]
