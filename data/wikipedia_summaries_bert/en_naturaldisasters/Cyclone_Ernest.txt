Cyclone Ernest was one of two intense tropical cyclones in the 2004â€“05 South-West Indian Ocean cyclone season.

[CLS] [SEP] It initially moved southwestward, intensifying into Tropical Storm Ernest on January 20 while moving into the Mozambique Channel. [CLS] [SEP] After hitting Mayotte, the storm quickly intensified to reach peak winds of 165 km/h (105 mph 10 minute winds) off the western coast of Madagascar. [CLS] [SEP] Ernest weakened slightly before striking the southwest portion of that country on January 23, producing widespread flooding and gusty winds.
