On 6 September 1952, a prototype de Havilland DH.110 jet fighter crashed during an aerial display at the Farnborough Airshow in Hampshire, England. [CLS] [SEP] The jet disintegrated mid-air during an aerobatic manoeuvre, causing the death of pilot John Derry and onboard flight test observer Anthony Richards. [CLS] [SEP] Debris from the aircraft fell onto a crowd of spectators, killing 29 people and injuring 60.The cause of the break-up was later determined to be structural failure due to a design flaw in the wing's leading edge. [CLS] [SEP] All DH.110s were initially grounded, but after modification to its design, the type entered service with the Royal Navy as the Sea Vixen. [CLS] [SEP] Stricter safety procedures were subsequently enacted for UK air shows and there were no further spectator fatalities until the 2015 Shoreham Airshow crash in which 11 people died.
