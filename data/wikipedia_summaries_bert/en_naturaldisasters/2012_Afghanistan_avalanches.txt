On March 4, 2012, at least three avalanches struck the Badakhshan province of northeastern Afghanistan. [CLS] [SEP] One of those avalanches destroyed a small village of about 200 people. [CLS] [SEP] The name of the village is uncertain; some sources call it Dasty and locate it in Darzab District, and others call it Sherin Nazim and locate it in Shekay District. [CLS] [SEP] Two other villages were affected by the avalanche. [CLS] [SEP] At least 50 people were killed in the disaster.Most buildings in the village, which was home to 24 families, were completely engulfed in snow. [CLS] [SEP] As of March 7, 50 people had been confirmed dead, with only 7 known survivors. [CLS] [SEP] Of the survivors, three were away fetching water at the time of the avalanche and thus survived uninjured. [CLS] [SEP] Seven people were found alive in the village, but three perished due to lack of medical attention. [CLS] [SEP] The remaining survivors were taken to the nearest hospital, in Tajikistan, for treatment. [CLS] [SEP] It is believed that most or all of the town's remaining residents are dead.The village affected by the avalanches was so remote that it took a full day for news of the disaster to reach Fayzabad, the province's capital. [CLS] [SEP] There are no roads in the affected area and people there generally travel on foot or horseback. [CLS] [SEP] Nearby villages offered what help they could, but outside rescue workers did not arrive on the scene until March 6 or 7, walking two days to get there. [CLS] [SEP] People from Darwaz District and twenty-five aid workers from Tajikistan were the first outside rescuers to arrive. [CLS] [SEP] Their progress toward the affected area was slowed by another avalanche. [CLS] [SEP] An aircraft carrying aid workers and journalists was unable to reach the region due to bad weather, while two Afghan Army helicopters managed to bring some aid workers into the region. [CLS] [SEP] Governor Shah Waliullah Adeeb tried to visit the disaster area himself, but was caught in yet another avalanche on the way and had to be rescued by helicopter.Conditions remained extremely hazardous in the immediate aftermath of the disaster. [CLS] [SEP] The risk of melting snow causing widespread flooding continues to threaten a larger-scale disaster for the Northern Afghanistan. [CLS] [SEP] A flood could spread disease and ruin farm land. [CLS] [SEP]
