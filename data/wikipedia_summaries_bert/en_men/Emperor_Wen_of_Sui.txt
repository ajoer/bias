[CLS] Emperor Wen of Sui (隋文帝; 21 July 541 – 13 August 604), personal name Yang Jian (楊堅), Xianbei name Puliuru Jian (普六茹堅), alias Narayana (Chinese: 那羅延; pinyin: Nàluóyán) deriving from Buddhist terms, was the founder and first emperor of China's Sui dynasty (581–618 AD). [SEP] [CLS] He was a hard-working administrator and a micromanager. [SEP] [CLS] The Sui Shu records him as having withdrawn his favour from the Confucians, giving it to "the group advocating Xing-Ming and authoritarian government." As a Buddhist, he encouraged the spread of Buddhism through the state. [SEP] [CLS] He is regarded as one of the most important emperors in ancient China history, reunifying China in 589 after centuries of division since the fall of the Western Jin dynasty in 316. [SEP] [CLS] During his reign, the construction of the Grand Canal began. [SEP] [CLS] As a Northern Zhou official, Yang Jian served with apparent distinction during the reigns of Emperor Wu of Northern Zhou and Emperor Xuan of Northern Zhou. [SEP] [CLS] When the erratic Emperor Xuan died in 580, Yang, as his father-in-law, seized power as regent. [SEP] [CLS] After defeating the general Yuchi Jiong, who resisted him, he seized the throne for himself, establishing the new Sui Dynasty (as its Emperor Wen). [SEP] [CLS] He was the first Chinese to rule the entire North China after the Xianbei clans conquered that area from the Liu Song dynasty (not counting the brief reconquest of that region by Emperor Wu of Liang). [SEP] [CLS] Generally speaking, Emperor Wen's reign was a great period of prosperity not seen since the Han Dynasty. [SEP] [CLS] Economically, the dynasty prospered. [SEP] [CLS] It was said that there was enough food stored for 50 years. [SEP] [CLS] The military was also powerful. [SEP] [CLS] At the beginning of his reign, Sui faced the threat of the Göktürks to the north, and neighbored Tibetan tribes to the west, Goguryeo in the northeast, and Champa (Linyi) threatening the south. [SEP] [CLS] By the end of Emperor Wen's reign, the Göktürks had split into an eastern and a western kaganate, the eastern one being nominally submissive to Sui, as was Goguryeo. [SEP] [CLS] Champa was defeated and, while not conquered, did not remain a threat. [SEP] [CLS] Emperor Wen is also famous for having the fewest concubines for an adult Chinese emperor. [SEP] [CLS] (Emperor Fei of Western Wei and the Ming dynasty Hongzhi Emperor were the only two perpetually monogamous Chinese emperors.) Emperor Wen was known for having only two concubines (although he might have had additional concubines not documented by traditional historians), with whom he might not have had sexual relations until after the death in 602 of his wife Empress Dugu, whom he loved and respected deeply.
