Hurricane Janet was the most powerful tropical cyclone of the 1955 Atlantic hurricane season and one of the strongest Atlantic hurricanes on record. [CLS] [SEP] Janet was also the first named storm to have 1,000 deaths and the first Category 5 named storm to be retired. [CLS] [SEP] The eleventh tropical storm, ninth hurricane, and fourth major hurricane of the year, Janet formed from a tropical wave east of the Lesser Antilles on September 21. [CLS] [SEP] Moving westward across the Caribbean Sea, Janet fluctuated in intensity, but generally strengthened before reaching its peak intensity as a Category 5 hurricane with winds of 175 mph (282 km/h). [CLS] [SEP] The intense hurricane later made landfall at that intensity near Chetumal, Mexico on September 28. [CLS] [SEP] After weakening over the Yucatán Peninsula, it moved into the Bay of Campeche, where it slightly strengthened before making its final landfall near Veracruz on September 29. [CLS] [SEP] Janet quickly weakened over Mexico's mountainous terrain before dissipating on September 30. [CLS] [SEP] In its developmental stages, Janet caused $7.8 million in damage to the Lesser Antilles and 189 deaths in the Grenadines and Barbados. [CLS] [SEP] While Janet was in the central Caribbean Sea, a reconnaissance aircraft flew into the storm and was lost, with all eleven crew members believed to be perished. [CLS] [SEP] This remains the only such loss which has occurred in association with an Atlantic hurricane. [CLS] [SEP] A Category 5 upon landfall on the Yucatán Peninsula, Janet caused severe devastation in areas of Quintana Roo and British Honduras. [CLS] [SEP] Only five buildings in Chetumal, Mexico remained intact after the storm, and an estimated 500 deaths occurred in the Mexican state of Quintana Roo. [CLS] [SEP] At Janet's second landfall near Veracruz, significant river flooding ensued, worsening effects caused by Hurricanes Gladys and Hilda earlier in the month. [CLS] [SEP] The floods left thousands of people stranded and killed at least 326 people in the Tampico area, leading to the largest Mexican relief operation ever executed by the United States. [CLS] [SEP] Janet's landfall as a Category 5 hurricane on the Yucatán Peninsula was the first recorded instance of a storm of such intensity in the Atlantic making landfall on a continental mainland; prior to Janet, landfalls of Category 5 intensity were only known to have taken place on islands. [CLS] [SEP] Janet's minimum barometric pressure, recorded in Chetumal, was at the time the second-lowest-recorded pressure on land associated with a tropical cyclone in the Atlantic, behind the 1935 Labor Day hurricane. [CLS] [SEP] At least 1,023 deaths were attributed to Hurricane Janet, as well as $65.8 million in damages. [CLS] [SEP]
