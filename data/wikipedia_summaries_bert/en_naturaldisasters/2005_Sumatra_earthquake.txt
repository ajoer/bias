The 2005 Niasâ€“Simeulue earthquake occurred on 28 March off the west coast of northern Sumatra, Indonesia. [CLS] [SEP] At least 915 people were killed, mostly on the island of Nias. [CLS] [SEP] The event caused panic in the region, which had already been devastated by the massive tsunami triggered by the 2004 Indian Ocean earthquake, but this earthquake generated a relatively small tsunami that caused limited damage. [CLS] [SEP] It was the third most powerful earthquake since 1965 in Indonesia. [CLS] [SEP] The earthquake occurred at 16:09:37 UTC (23:09:37 local time) on 28 March 2005. [CLS] [SEP] The hypocenter was located 30 kilometres (19 mi) below the surface of the Indian Ocean, where subduction is forcing the Indo-Australian Plate to the southwest under the Eurasian Plate's Sunda edge. [CLS] [SEP] The area is 200 kilometres (120 mi) west of Sibolga, Sumatra, or 1,400 kilometres (870 mi) northwest of Jakarta, approximately halfway between the islands of Nias and Simeulue. [CLS] [SEP] Seismic recordings give the earthquake a moment magnitude of about 8.6, and effects were felt as far away as Bangkok, Thailand, over 1,000 kilometres (620 mi) away. [CLS] [SEP]
