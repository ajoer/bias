[CLS] Hurricane Connie was a Category 4 hurricane that contributed to significant flooding across the eastern United States in August 1955, just days before Hurricane Diane affected the same general area. [SEP] [CLS] Connie formed on August 3 from a tropical wave in the eastern Atlantic Ocean. [SEP] [CLS] It moved quickly west-northwestward, strengthening into a hurricane by August 4. [SEP] [CLS] Connie first posed a threat to the Lesser Antilles, ultimately passing about 105 mi (165 km) north of the island group. [SEP] [CLS] In the United States Virgin Islands, three people died due to the hurricane, and a few homes were destroyed. [SEP] [CLS] The outer rainbands produced hurricane-force wind gusts and intense precipitation, reaching 8.65 in (220 mm) in Puerto Rico. [SEP] [CLS] On the island, Connie destroyed 60 homes and caused crop damage. [SEP] [CLS] After affecting Puerto Rico, Connie reached maximum sustained winds of 140 mph (220 km/h), and a barometric pressure of 944 mbar (27.9 inHg), as observed by the Hurricane Hunters on August 7. [SEP] [CLS] The hurricane later weakened, slowed its forward motion, and turned to the north, striking North Carolina on August 12 as a Category 2 on the Saffir-Simpson scale. [SEP] [CLS] Connie was the first of three damaging tropical cyclones in the 1955 hurricane season to hit the state, along with Diane and Ione. [SEP] [CLS] The storm progressed inland after moving through the Chesapeake Bay region, and was later absorbed by a cold front over Lake Huron on August 15. [SEP] [CLS] Ahead of the storm, the United States Weather Bureau issued widespread hurricane warnings, spurring evacuations, flight cancelations, and beach closures. [SEP] [CLS] Connie produced strong winds, high tides, and heavy rainfall as it moved ashore, causing heavy crop damage and 27 deaths in North Carolina. [SEP] [CLS] Four people were killed in Washington, D.C. [SEP] [CLS] due to a traffic accident caused by slick roads. [SEP] [CLS] In Chesapeake Bay, Connie capsized a boat, killing 14 people and prompting a change in Coast Guard regulations. [SEP] [CLS] There were six deaths each in Pennsylvania and New Jersey, and 14 deaths in New York, where record rainfall flooded houses and subways. [SEP] [CLS] At least 295,000 people nationwide lost electric power during the storm. [SEP] [CLS] Damage in the United States totaled around $86 million (1955 USD). [SEP] [CLS] The rains from Connie contributed to flooding from Hurricane Diane that caused $700 million in damage. [SEP] [CLS] The remnants of Connie killed three people in Ontario, and also destroyed a few houses and boats in the province. [SEP] [CLS] As a result of its impacts, including a death toll of 77, the name Connie was retired from the Atlantic hurricane naming list. [SEP] [CLS]
