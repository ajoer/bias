[CLS] Typhoon Imbudo, known in the Philippines as Typhoon Harurot, was a powerful typhoon that struck the Philippines and southern China in July 2003. [SEP] [CLS] The seventh named storm and fourth typhoon of the season, Imbudo formed on July 15 to the east of the Philippines. [SEP] [CLS] The storm moved generally west-northward for much of its duration due to a ridge to the north. [SEP] [CLS] Favorable conditions allowed Imbudo to intensify, gradually at first before undergoing rapid deepening on July 19. [SEP] [CLS] After reaching typhoon status, Imbudo strengthened further to peak 10–minute sustained winds of 165 km/h (105 mph) on July 20. [SEP] [CLS] The typhoon made landfall on northern Luzon near peak intensity on July 22, but quickly weakened over land. [SEP] [CLS] Once in the South China Sea, Imbudo re-intensified slightly before making its final landfall in southern China near Yangjiang on July 24, dissipating the next day. [SEP] [CLS] In the Philippines, Imbudo was the strongest typhoon in five years, causing widespread flooding and power outages in the Cagayan Valley for weeks. [SEP] [CLS] Damage was heaviest in Isabela province near where the storm struck. [SEP] [CLS] Most of the banana crop was destroyed, and other crops sustained similar but lesser damage. [SEP] [CLS] Imbudo disrupted transportation across much of Luzon. [SEP] [CLS] Nationwide, the storm damaged or destroyed 62,314 houses, causing P4.7 billion (PHP, $86 million USD) in damage, mostly in the Cagayan Valley. [SEP] [CLS] There were also 64 deaths in the country. [SEP] [CLS] In Hong Kong, strong winds killed a man after knocking him off a platform.

[SEP] [CLS] Hundreds of canceled flights stranded travelers across the region. [SEP] [CLS] In Guangxi, high rainfall increased water levels in 45 reservoirs to warning levels.
