[CLS] Johanna Clara Louise Lehzen (3 October 1784 – 9 September 1870), also known as Baroness Louise Lehzen, was the governess and later companion to Queen Victoria. [SEP] [CLS] Born to a Lutheran pastor in Hanover, in 1819 Lehzen entered the household of the Duke of Kent, fourth son of King George III. [SEP] [CLS] Five years later, Lehzen was appointed governess to his only child, Princess Alexandrina Victoria. [SEP] [CLS] The young princess became second-in-line to the British throne in 1827. [SEP] [CLS] Victoria's upbringing was dominated by the controlling Kensington System, implemented by the now widowed Duchess of Kent and her comptroller Sir John Conroy. [SEP] [CLS] Lehzen was strongly protective of Victoria, and encouraged the princess to be strong, informed, and independent from the Duchess and Conroy's influence, causing friction within the household. [SEP] [CLS] Attempts to remove the governess were unsuccessful, as Lehzen had the support of Victoria’s royal uncles. [SEP] [CLS] "Dear, good Lehzen" soon came to supersede all others–including her own mother–in Victoria’s eyes. [SEP] [CLS] When Victoria became queen in 1837, Lehzen served as a sort of unofficial private secretary, enjoying apartments adjacent to Victoria. [SEP] [CLS] The Queen's marriage to Prince Albert in 1840 led to significant changes in the royal household. [SEP] [CLS] Albert and Lehzen detested each other, and after an illness of the Princess Royal in 1841, Lehzen was dismissed. [SEP] [CLS] Her close relationship with the queen came to an end, although the two continued to correspond. [SEP] [CLS] Lehzen spent her final years in Hanover on a generous pension, dying in 1870. [SEP] [CLS] Lehzen was a major influence on Victoria's character, in particular giving her the strength of will to survive her troubled childhood and life as a young queen. [SEP] [CLS]
