Typhoon Tingting was a destructive tropical cyclone that produced record-breaking rains in Guam. [CLS] [SEP] The eighth named storm of the 2004 Pacific typhoon season, Tingting originated from a tropical depression over the open waters of the western Pacific Ocean. [CLS] [SEP] The storm gradually intensified as it traveled northwest, becoming a typhoon on June 28 and reaching its peak the following day while passing through the Mariana Islands. [CLS] [SEP] After maintaining typhoon intensity for three days, a combination of dry air and cooler sea surface temperatures caused the storm to weaken as it traveled northward.
