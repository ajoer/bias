[CLS] Hurricane Beryl was the second-earliest Atlantic hurricane to form in the main development region (MDR) on record, the first to form in the MDR in July since Bertha in 2008, and the first July Atlantic hurricane since Arthur in 2014. [SEP] [CLS] The second named storm and first hurricane of the 2018 Atlantic hurricane season, Beryl formed from a vigorous tropical wave that moved off the west coast of Africa on July 2. [SEP] [CLS] The wave quickly organized into a tropical depression over the central Atlantic by July 4. [SEP] [CLS] Rapid intensification took place and it quickly became a tropical storm at 18:30 UTC that day. [SEP] [CLS] Just less than 15 hours later, Beryl strengthened into the first hurricane of the season, reaching its peak intensity on July 6. [SEP] [CLS] Increasingly unfavorable conditions caused a rapid deterioration of the cyclone shortly after peak, with Beryl falling to tropical storm status on the next day as it began to accelerate towards the Caribbean. [SEP] [CLS] Late on July 8, it degenerated into a tropical wave shortly before reaching the Lesser Antilles. [SEP] [CLS] The remnants were monitored for several days, although they failed to organize significantly until July 14, when it regenerated into a subtropical storm six days after its initial dissipation. [SEP] [CLS] However, the newly-reformed storm quickly lost convection, and it degenerated into a remnant low early on July 16, while over the Gulf Stream. [SEP] [CLS] Beryl prompted multiple islands in the Lesser Antilles to issue warnings and watches, including a hurricane watch as it was initially expected to pass through the islands of Dominica and Guadeloupe as a hurricane. [SEP] [CLS] The storm weakened faster than expected and Beryl dissipated before it reached the islands, though effects were still felt across the eastern Caribbean. [SEP] [CLS] Several areas in the region were recovering from the catastrophic impacts from Hurricanes Irma and Maria during the previous season. [SEP] [CLS] Beryl's remnants caused flash flooding and landslides across the island of Puerto Rico and caused several schools to close; approximately 47,000 lost power on the island. [SEP] [CLS]
