A train is a form of rail transport consisting of a series of connected vehicles that generally run along a railroad (or railway) track to transport passengers or cargo (also known as "freight" or "goods"). [CLS] [SEP] The word "train" comes from the Old French trahiner, derived from the Latin trahere meaning "to pull" or "to draw".Motive power for a train is provided by a separate locomotive or individual motors in a self-propelled multiple unit. [CLS] [SEP] The term "engine" is often used as an alternative to locomotive. [CLS] [SEP] Although historically steam propulsion dominated, the most common types of locomotive are diesel and electric, the latter supplied by overhead wires or additional rails. [CLS] [SEP] Trains can also be hauled by horses, pulled by engine or water-driven cable or wire winch, run downhill using gravity, or powered by pneumatics, gas turbines or electric batteries. [CLS] [SEP] The track usually consists of two running rails with a fixed spacing, which may be supplemented by additional rails such as electric conducting rails ("third rail") and rack rails. [CLS] [SEP] Monorails and maglev guideways are also occasionally used.Passenger trains include passenger-carrying vehicles and can often be very long and fast. [CLS] [SEP] High-speed rail systems began expanding rapidly in the late 20th century, and this remains a major subject of further development. [CLS] [SEP] The term "light rail" is sometimes used to refer to a modern tram system, but it may also mean an intermediate form between a tram and a train, similar to a heavy rail rapid transit system. [CLS] [SEP] Freight (goods) trains use freight cars (or wagons/trucks) to transport goods or materials (cargo). [CLS] [SEP] It is possible to carry passengers and freight in the same train using a mixed consist. [CLS] [SEP] Rail cars and machinery that are used for the maintenance and repair of tracks, are termed "maintenance of way" equipment; these may be assembled into maintenance of way trains. [CLS] [SEP] Similarly, dedicated trains may be used to provide support services to stations along a train line, such as garbage or revenue collection. [CLS] [SEP]
