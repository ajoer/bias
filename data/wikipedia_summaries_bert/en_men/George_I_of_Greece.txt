[CLS] George I (Greek: Γεώργιος Α΄, Geórgios I; 24 December 1845 – 18 March 1913) was King of Greece from 1863 until his assassination in 1913. [SEP] [CLS] Originally a Danish prince, he was born in Copenhagen, and seemed destined for a career in the Royal Danish Navy. [SEP] [CLS] He was only 17 years old when he was elected king by the Greek National Assembly, which had deposed the unpopular former king Otto. [SEP] [CLS] His nomination was both suggested and supported by the Great Powers: the United Kingdom of Great Britain and Ireland, the Second French Empire and the Russian Empire. [SEP] [CLS] He married Grand Duchess Olga Constantinovna of Russia in 1867, and became the first monarch of a new Greek dynasty. [SEP] [CLS] Two of his sisters, Alexandra and Dagmar, married into the British and Russian royal families. [SEP] [CLS] King Edward VII and Tsar Alexander III were his brothers-in-law, and King George V, Tsar Nicholas II, King Christian X of Denmark and King Haakon VII of Norway were his nephews. [SEP] [CLS] George's reign of almost 50 years (the longest in modern Greek history) was characterized by territorial gains as Greece established its place in pre-World War I Europe. [SEP] [CLS] Britain ceded the Ionian Islands peacefully in 1864, while Thessaly was annexed from the Ottoman Empire after the Russo-Turkish War (1877–1878). [SEP] [CLS] Greece was not always successful in its territorial ambitions; it was defeated in the Greco-Turkish War (1897). [SEP] [CLS] During the First Balkan War, after Greek troops had captured much of Greek Macedonia, George was assassinated in Thessaloniki. [SEP] [CLS] Compared with his own long tenure, the reigns of his successors Constantine I, Alexander, and George II proved short and insecure. [SEP] [CLS]
