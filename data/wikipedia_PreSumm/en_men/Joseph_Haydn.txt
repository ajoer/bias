[CLS] Franz Joseph Haydn (; German: [ˈfʁants ˈjoːzɛf ˈhaɪdn̩] (listen); 31 March 1732 – 31 May 1809) was an Austrian composer of the Classical period. [SEP] [CLS] He was instrumental in the development of chamber music such as the piano trio. [SEP] [CLS] His contributions to musical form have earned him the epithets "Father of the Symphony" and "Father of the String Quartet".Haydn spent much of his career as a court musician for the wealthy Esterházy family at their remote estate. [SEP] [CLS] Until the later part of his life, this isolated him from other composers and trends in music so that he was, as he put it, "forced to become original". [SEP] [CLS] Yet his music circulated widely, and for much of his career he was the most celebrated composer in Europe. [SEP] [CLS] He was a friend and mentor of Mozart, a tutor of Beethoven, and the older brother of composer Michael Haydn. [SEP] [CLS]
