[CLS] The tale of Tiddalik the Frog is a legend from Australian Aboriginal mythology. [SEP] [CLS] In the telling of the myth, Tiddalik awoke one morning with an unquenchable thirst, and began to drink until all the fresh water was greedily consumed. [SEP] [CLS] Creatures and plant life everywhere began to die due to lack of moisture. [SEP] [CLS] Other animals conspired against Tiddalik and devised a plan for him to release all of the water he had consumed. [SEP] [CLS] This was successfully coordinated by a wise old Owl, when Nabunum the eel made Tiddalik laugh when he tied himself in comical shapes. [SEP] [CLS] As Tiddalik laughed, the water rushed out of him to replenish the lakes, swamps and rivers. [SEP] [CLS] The legend of Tiddalik is not only an important story of the Dreamtime, but has been the subject of popular modern children's books. [SEP] [CLS] In some Aboriginal cultures, Tiddalik is known as "Molok". [SEP] [CLS] The story has been said to describe the Water-holding Frog (Litoria platycephala), from central Australia. [SEP] [CLS] The frogs burrow under ground during dry periods, and emerge during the rain to absorb large amounts of water, breed and feed. [SEP] [CLS] This allows it to avoid desiccation during drought, a trait not exhibited by most frogs. [SEP] [CLS] They were used by Indigenous Australians during times of drought as a source of water.
