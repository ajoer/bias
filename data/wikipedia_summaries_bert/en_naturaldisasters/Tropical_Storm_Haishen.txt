The 2008 Pacific typhoon season had no official bounds; it ran year-round in 2008, but most tropical cyclones tend to form in the northwestern Pacific Ocean between May and November. [CLS] [SEP] These dates conventionally delimit the period of each year when most tropical cyclones form in the northwestern Pacific Ocean. [CLS] [SEP] The scope of this article is limited to the Pacific Ocean, north of the equator and west of the International Date Line. [CLS] [SEP] Storms that form east of the date line and north of the equator are called hurricanes; see 2008 Pacific hurricane season. [CLS] [SEP] Tropical storms formed in the entire Western North Pacific basin are assigned a name by the Japan Meteorological Agency. [CLS] [SEP] Tropical depressions formed in this basin are given a number with a "W" suffix by the United States' Joint Typhoon Warning Center. [CLS] [SEP] In addition, the Philippine Atmospheric, Geophysical and Astronomical Services Administration (PAGASA) assigns names to tropical cyclones (including tropical depressions) that enter or form in the Philippine area of responsibility. [CLS] [SEP] These names, however, are not in common use outside of the Philippines. [CLS] [SEP]
