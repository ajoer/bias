Aerom√©xico Connect Flight 2431 (SLI2431/5D2431) was a Mexican domestic scheduled passenger flight bound for Mexico City that crashed on takeoff from Durango International Airport on July 31, 2018. [CLS] [SEP] Shortly after becoming airborne, the plane encountered sudden wind shear caused by a microburst. [CLS] [SEP] The plane rapidly lost speed and altitude and impacted the runway, detaching the engines and skidding to a halt about 1,000 feet (300 m) beyond the runway. [CLS] [SEP] The plane caught fire and was destroyed. [CLS] [SEP] All 103 people on board survived, but 39 passengers and crew members were injured. [CLS] [SEP] A final report on the crash was released on February 23, 2019. [CLS] [SEP] Investigators found that the primary cause of the accident was adverse weather conditions encountered by the flight, and contributing factors included crew error, air traffic controller error, and the lack of equipment that could detect wind shear conditions at airports. [CLS] [SEP] Investigators determined that an unauthorized student pilot in the cockpit who was flying the plane during the takeoff caused the crew to be distracted, leading to a loss of situational awareness. [CLS] [SEP] The crew failed to react to dangerous weather conditions that were developing, and did not notice irregularities in the airspeed indicators that could have alerted them to potential hazards. [CLS] [SEP] The sole air traffic controller on duty at the airport at the time also failed to notify the aircraft of rapidly deteriorating weather conditions. [CLS] [SEP] The accident and the subsequent investigation led to changes in Mexican aviation regulations to prevent unassigned crew members from being present in the cockpit of an aircraft at any time during a flight. [CLS] [SEP] Investigators also made several recommendations for changes in flight crew and air traffic controller training, and to improve the capabilities of weather detection equipment in place at airports to improve overall aviation safety.
