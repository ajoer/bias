[CLS] James Madison Jr. [SEP] [CLS] (March 16, 1751 â€“ June 28, 1836) was an American statesman, diplomat, expansionist, philosopher and Founding Father who served as the fourth president of the United States from 1809 to 1817. [SEP] [CLS] He is hailed as the "Father of the Constitution" for his pivotal role in drafting and promoting the Constitution of the United States and the United States Bill of Rights. [SEP] [CLS] He co-wrote The Federalist Papers, co-founded the Democratic-Republican Party, and served as the fifth United States secretary of State from 1801 to 1809. [SEP] [CLS] Born into a prominent Virginia planter family, Madison served as a member of the Virginia House of Delegates and the Continental Congress during and after the American Revolutionary War. [SEP] [CLS] He became dissatisfied with the weak national government established by the Articles of Confederation and helped organize the Constitutional Convention, which produced a new constitution to supplant the Articles of Confederation. [SEP] [CLS] Madison's Virginia Plan served as the basis for the Constitutional Convention's deliberations, and he was one of the most influential individuals at the convention. [SEP] [CLS] Madison became one of the leaders in the movement to ratify the Constitution, and he joined with Alexander Hamilton and John Jay in writing The Federalist Papers, a series of pro-ratification essays that was one of the most influential works of political science in American history. [SEP] [CLS] After the ratification of the Constitution, Madison emerged as an important leader in the United States House of Representatives and served as a close adviser to President George Washington. [SEP] [CLS] He was the main force behind the ratification of the United States Bill of Rights, which enshrines guarantees of personal freedoms and rights within the Constitution. [SEP] [CLS] During the early 1790s, Madison came to oppose the economic program and accompanying centralization of power favored by Secretary of the Treasury Alexander Hamilton. [SEP] [CLS] Along with Thomas Jefferson, Madison organized the Democratic-Republican Party, which was, alongside Hamilton's Federalist Party, one of the nation's first major political parties. [SEP] [CLS] After Jefferson won the 1800 presidential election, Madison served as Secretary of State from 1801 to 1809. [SEP] [CLS] In that position, he supervised the Louisiana Purchase, which doubled the size of the United States. [SEP] [CLS] Madison succeeded Jefferson with a victory in the 1808 presidential election. [SEP] [CLS] After diplomatic protests and a trade embargo failed to end British attacks against American shipping, he led the United States into the War of 1812. [SEP] [CLS] The war was an administrative morass and ended inconclusively, but many Americans saw it as a successful "second war of independence" against Britain. [SEP] [CLS] The war convinced Madison of the necessity of a stronger federal government, and he presided over the creation of the Second Bank of the United States and the enactment of the protective Tariff of 1816. [SEP] [CLS] Madison's presidency, by treaty or war, added 23 million acres of American Indian land to the United States. [SEP] [CLS] He retired from public office in 1817 and died in 1836. [SEP] [CLS] Madison was never able to privately reconcile his Republican beliefs and his slave ownership. [SEP] [CLS] Madison is considered to be one of the most important Founding Fathers of the United States, and historians have generally ranked him as an above-average president. [SEP] [CLS]
