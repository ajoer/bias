Abraham Lincoln (; February 12, 1809 – April 15, 1865) was an American statesman and lawyer who served as the 16th president of the United States from 1861 to 1865. [CLS] [SEP] Lincoln led the nation through its greatest moral, constitutional, and political crisis in the American Civil War. [CLS] [SEP] He succeeded in preserving the Union, abolishing slavery, bolstering the federal government, and modernizing the U.S. [CLS] [SEP] economy. [CLS] [SEP] Lincoln was born into poverty in a log cabin and was raised on the frontier primarily in Indiana. [CLS] [SEP] He was self-educated and became a lawyer, Whig Party leader, Illinois state legislator, and U.S. [CLS] [SEP] Congressman from Illinois. [CLS] [SEP] In 1849 he returned to his law practice but became vexed by the opening of additional lands to slavery as a result of the Kansas–Nebraska Act. [CLS] [SEP] He reentered politics in 1854, becoming a leader in the new Republican Party, and he reached a national audience in the 1858 debates against Stephen Douglas. [CLS] [SEP] Lincoln ran for President in 1860, sweeping the North in victory. [CLS] [SEP] Pro-slavery elements in the South equated his success with the North's rejection of their right to practice slavery, and southern states began seceding from the union. [CLS] [SEP] To secure its independence, the new Confederate States fired on Fort Sumter, a U.S. [CLS] [SEP] fort in the South, and Lincoln called up forces to suppress the rebellion and restore the Union. [CLS] [SEP] As the leader of moderate Republicans, Lincoln had to navigate a contentious array of factions with friends and opponents on both sides. [CLS] [SEP] War Democrats rallied a large faction of former opponents into his moderate camp, but they were countered by Radical Republicans, who demanded harsh treatment of the Southern traitors. [CLS] [SEP] Anti-war Democrats (called "Copperheads") despised him, and irreconcilable pro-Confederate elements plotted his assassination. [CLS] [SEP] Lincoln managed the factions by exploiting their mutual enmity, by carefully distributing political patronage, and by appealing to the U.S. [CLS] [SEP] people. [CLS] [SEP] His Gettysburg Address became a historic clarion call for nationalism, republicanism, equal rights, liberty, and democracy. [CLS] [SEP] Lincoln scrutinized the strategy and tactics in the war effort, including the selection of generals and the naval blockade of the South's trade. [CLS] [SEP] He suspended habeas corpus, and he averted British intervention by defusing the Trent Affair. [CLS] [SEP] He engineered the end to slavery with his Emancipation Proclamation and his order that the Army protect and recruit former slaves. [CLS] [SEP] He also encouraged border states to outlaw slavery, and promoted the Thirteenth Amendment to the United States Constitution, which outlawed slavery across the country. [CLS] [SEP] Lincoln managed his own successful re-election campaign. [CLS] [SEP] He sought to heal the war-torn nation by through reconciliation. [CLS] [SEP] On April 14, 1865, just days after the war's end at Appomattox, Lincoln was attending a play at Ford's Theatre with his wife Mary when he was assassinated by Confederate sympathizer John Wilkes Booth. [CLS] [SEP] His marriage had produced four sons, two of whom preceded him in death, with severe emotional impact upon him and Mary. [CLS] [SEP] Lincoln is remembered as the United States' martyr hero, and he is consistently ranked as the greatest U.S. [CLS] [SEP] president in history. [CLS] [SEP]
