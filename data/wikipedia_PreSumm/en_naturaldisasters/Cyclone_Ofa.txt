[CLS] Severe Tropical Cyclone Ofa was considered to be the worst tropical cyclone to affect Polynesia since Cyclone Bebe. [SEP] [CLS] The system was first noted on January 27, 1990, near Tuvalu, as a shallow tropical depression that had developed within the South Pacific Convergence Zone. [SEP] [CLS] The cloud pattern slowly organized, and on January 31, while located east of Tuvalu, Ofa attained cyclone intensity. [SEP] [CLS] Moving slowly southeast, Ofa developed storm-force winds. [SEP] [CLS] It attained hurricane-force winds on February 2. [SEP] [CLS] Cyclone Ofa reached peak intensity on February 4. [SEP] [CLS] Shortly after, its peak Ofa began to weaken over a less favourable environment. [SEP] [CLS] Ofa was declared an extratropical cyclone on February 8, though the system was still tracked by meteorologists until February 10. [SEP] [CLS] Ofa produced gales or high winds or gales on many islands, resulting in widespread damage due to a combination of storm surge and high seas. [SEP] [CLS] In all, eight people were killed and damage totaled to US$187 million. [SEP] [CLS] The worst effects were recorded in Samoa, where seven people were killed. [SEP] [CLS] Roughly 200 people were evacuated, and 10 to 20 others were injured through the islands. [SEP] [CLS] Extreme damage to crops and trees was also recorded. [SEP] [CLS] Elsewhere, Ofa was blamed for the lowest ever recorded pressure on the island of Niue, along with considerable damage. [SEP] [CLS]
