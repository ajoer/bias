[CLS] The Gilgamesh flood myth is a flood myth in the Epic of Gilgamesh. [SEP] [CLS] Many scholars believe that the flood myth was added to Tablet XI in the "standard version" of the Gilgamesh Epic by an editor who used the flood story from the Epic of Atrahasis. [SEP] [CLS] A short reference to the flood myth is also present in the much older Sumerian Gilgamesh poems, from which the later Babylonian versions drew much of their inspiration and subject matter.
