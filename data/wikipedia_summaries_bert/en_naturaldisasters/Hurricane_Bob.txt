Hurricane Bob was one of the costliest hurricanes in New England history. [CLS] [SEP] The second named storm and first hurricane of the 1991 Atlantic hurricane season, Bob developed from an area of low pressure near The Bahamas on August 16. [CLS] [SEP] The depression steadily intensified, and became Tropical Storm Bob late on August 16. [CLS] [SEP] Bob curved north-northwestward as a tropical storm, but re-curved to the north-northeast after becoming a hurricane on August 17. [CLS] [SEP] As such, it brushed the Outer Banks of North Carolina on August 18 and August 19, and subsequently intensified into a major hurricane (Category 3 or greater on the Saffir-Simpson Hurricane Scale). [CLS] [SEP] After peaking in intensity with maximum sustained winds of 115 mph (185 km/h), Bob weakened slightly as it approached the coast of New England. [CLS] [SEP] Some sources say the winds of Bob might have gone as high as 125 mph sustained.Bob made landfall twice in Rhode Island as a Category 2 hurricane on August 19, first on Block Island and then in Newport. [CLS] [SEP] Upon doing so, it became the only hurricane to make landfall in the contiguous United States during the 1991 season. [CLS] [SEP] Moving further inland, Bob rapidly weakened, and deteriorated to a tropical storm while emerging into the Gulf of Maine. [CLS] [SEP] Shortly thereafter, Bob made landfall in Maine as a strong tropical storm early on August 20. [CLS] [SEP] Bob entered the Canadian province of New Brunswick a few hours later, where it transitioned into an extratropical cyclone. [CLS] [SEP] By August 21, the remnants of Bob crossed Newfoundland and re-emerged into the open Atlantic Ocean. [CLS] [SEP] The remnants traveled a long distance across the northern Atlantic Ocean, and finally dissipated west of Portugal on August 29. [CLS] [SEP] Bob left extensive damage throughout New England in its wake, totaling approximately $1.5 billion (1991 USD, $2.82 billion 2020 USD). [CLS] [SEP] This made it one of the costliest United States hurricanes at the time; as of 2013, it ranked thirty-second in the category. [CLS] [SEP] But some sources say that Bob might have caused as much as $3 billion (1991 USD, $5.63 billion 2020 USD) in damage. [CLS] [SEP] In addition, eighteen fatalities were reported in association with Bob. [CLS] [SEP] The loss of life and most of the damage occurred as a result of high winds and rough seas. [CLS] [SEP] There were six confirmed tornadoes during its passage. [CLS] [SEP] Bob is the most recent hurricane to hit the New England states directly as a hurricane. [CLS] [SEP]
