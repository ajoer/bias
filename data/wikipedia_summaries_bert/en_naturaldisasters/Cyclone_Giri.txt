[CLS] Very Severe Cyclonic Storm Giri (IMD designation: BOB 04, JTWC designation 04B, also known as Cyclone Giri) was a powerful tropical cyclone which caused catastrophic damage in parts of Myanmar in late October 2010. [SEP] [CLS] Originating from an area of low pressure over the Bay of Bengal on October 19, the system began as a weak depression 250 km (155 mi) south of Myanmar. [SEP] [CLS] Over the following few days, the depression underwent explosive intensification, reaching its peak intensity with winds of 195 km/h (120 mph 3-minute sustained) on October 22. [SEP] [CLS] Cyclone Giri made landfall roughly 50 km (31 mi) northwest of Kyaukpyu, shortly after peaking. [SEP] [CLS] Within hours of moving onshore, the system had substantially weakened. [SEP] [CLS] By the following day, Giri had degenerated into a tropical depression and the final advisory was issued on the storm. [SEP] [CLS] Unlike during Cyclone Nargis in 2008, the Government of Myanmar took steps to ensure the safety of residents in the path of Cyclone Giri. [SEP] [CLS] An estimated 53,000 are believed to have evacuated Kyaukphyu before the arrival of the storm. [SEP] [CLS] Throughout central Myanmar, at least 157 people are known to have been killed by Giri. [SEP] [CLS] Thousands of structures near where the storm made landfall were destroyed, leaving more than 70,000 people homeless. [SEP] [CLS] An international relief effort began shortly after the storm passed to assist survivors of the storm. [SEP] [CLS] Initially, local and foreign media initially criticized the Myanmar government for not giving residents enough warning of the storm and later for keeping quiet on the situation. [SEP] [CLS] However, the focus later shifted to the loss of life and relief efforts. [SEP] [CLS]
