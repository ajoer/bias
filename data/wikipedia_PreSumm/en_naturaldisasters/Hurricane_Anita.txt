[SEP] [CLS] Initially, Anita was forecast to strike Texas, though a building ridge turned it to the west-southwest. [SEP] [CLS] The hurricane rapidly strengthened to attain peak winds of 175 mph (280 km/h), and on September 2 Anita made landfall in eastern Tamaulipas as a Category 5 hurricane. [SEP] [CLS] It quickly weakened as it crossed Mexico, and after briefly redeveloping into a tropical depression in the eastern Pacific Ocean, Anita dissipated on September 4 to the south of the Baja California Peninsula. [SEP] [CLS] The hurricane produced light rainfall and high tides along the Gulf Coast of the United States. [SEP] [CLS] Some low-level flooding was reported, but damage was slight.
