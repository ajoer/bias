[CLS] Emperor Jianwen of Jin (simplified Chinese: 晋简文帝; traditional Chinese: 晉簡文帝; pinyin: Jìn Jiǎnwén Dì; Wade–Giles: Chin Chien-wen-ti; 320 – September 12, 372), personal name Sima Yu (司馬昱), courtesy name Daowan (道萬), was an emperor of the Eastern Jin Dynasty (265-420) in China. [SEP] [CLS] He was the younger brother of Emperor Ming and installed by military leader Huan Wen. [SEP] [CLS] Prior to taking the throne, he had served in important roles in the administrations of his grandnephews Emperor Mu, Emperor Ai, and Emperor Fei. [SEP] [CLS] Both in his service to his grandnephews and in his own reign as emperor, he is generally viewed as a weak-willed figure who showed enough wisdom to continue to survive and extend Jin rule, but whose effectiveness was also compromised by his over-dedication to philosophical discussions of Taoism and other related philosophies.
