[CLS] [SEP] While still in his teens, he was able to determine a necessary and sufficient condition for a polynomial to be solvable by radicals, thereby solving a problem standing for 350 years. [CLS] [SEP] His work laid the foundations for Galois theory and group theory, two major branches of abstract algebra, and the subfield of Galois connections. [CLS] [SEP] He died at age 20 from wounds suffered in a duel. [CLS] [SEP]
