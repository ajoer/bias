[CLS] Pelagius (c. [SEP] [CLS] AD 354 â€“ 418) was a theologian who advocated free will and asceticism. [SEP] [CLS] He was accused by Augustine of Hippo and others of denying the need for divine aid in performing good works. [SEP] [CLS] They understood him to have said that the only grace necessary was the declaration of the law; humans were not wounded by Adam's sin and were perfectly able to fulfill the law without divine aid. [SEP] [CLS] Pelagius denied Augustine's theory of original sin. [SEP] [CLS] Adherents of Pelagius cited Deuteronomy 24:16 in support of their position. [SEP] [CLS] Pelagius was declared a heretic by the Council of Ephesus in 431. [SEP] [CLS] His interpretation of a doctrine of free will became known as Pelagianism. [SEP] [CLS] He was well educated, fluent in both Greek and Latin, and learned in theology. [SEP] [CLS] He spent time as an ascetic, focusing on practical asceticism. [SEP] [CLS] He was well known in Rome, both for the harsh asceticism of his public life and the power and persuasiveness of his speech. [SEP] [CLS] His reputation earned him praise early in his career even from such pillars of the Church as Augustine, who referred to him as a "saintly man." However, he was later accused of lying about his own teachings to avoid public condemnation. [SEP] [CLS] Most of his later life was spent defending his doctrine against Christian theologians who held that Pelagius was spreading novelties in the Faith unknown to the apostolic tradition. [SEP] [CLS] Despite being considered an arch-heretic for more than a thousand years, Pelagius and his teachings have been reevaluated in the twentieth century. [SEP] [CLS]
