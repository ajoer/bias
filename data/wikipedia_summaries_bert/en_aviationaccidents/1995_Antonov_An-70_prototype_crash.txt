[CLS] The Antonov An-70 (Ukrainian: Антонов Ан-70) is a four-engine medium-range transport aircraft, and the first aircraft to take flight powered only by propfan engines. [SEP] [CLS] It was developed in the late 1980s by the Antonov Design Bureau to replace the obsolete An-12 military transport aircraft. [SEP] [CLS] The maiden flight of the first prototype took place in December 1994 in Kiev, now independent Ukraine. [SEP] [CLS] Within months the prototype had suffered a mid-air collision. [SEP] [CLS] A second airframe was produced to allow the flight-test programme to proceed. [SEP] [CLS] Both prototypes were produced by the Kiev Aircraft Production Plant. [SEP] [CLS] Following the dissolution of the Soviet Union in the early 1990s, the programme became a joint development between Russia and Ukraine. [SEP] [CLS] The former compounded the issue of a reduced market with its intermittent commitment to the project. [SEP] [CLS] Repeated attempts to start production have had limited success. [SEP] [CLS] Western European countries, including Germany, at one stage assessed the aircraft for procurement, but many later decided against it. [SEP] [CLS]
