Severe Tropical Cyclone Gwenda was tied with Cyclone Inigo as the most intense Australian tropical cyclone on record (with the possible exception of Cyclone Mahina), with a barometric pressure of 900 hPa (mbar) and was the most intense storm worldwide in 1999. [CLS] [SEP] Forming out of a tropical disturbance over the Arafura Sea on 2 April 1999, the precursor to Gwenda tracked slowly westward and gradually became more organised. [CLS] [SEP] On 4 April, the system developed into a Category 1 cyclone and was named Gwenda. [CLS] [SEP] It began to undergo explosive intensification the following day, and in a 30-hour span ending early on 7 April, the storm's maximum 10-minute sustained wind speed increased from 75 km/h (45 mph) to 225 km/h (140 mph) and its barometric pressure decreased to 900 hPa (mbar). [CLS] [SEP] The Joint Typhoon Warning Center reported that the storm had peaked as a high-end Category 4 equivalent on the Saffirâ€“Simpson hurricane scale. [CLS] [SEP] Increasing wind shear and an acceleration in forward speed caused Gwenda to quickly weaken. [CLS] [SEP] Less than 18 hours after peaking, the storm made landfall roughly 45 km (28 mi) east of Port Hedland, Western Australia with winds of 100 km/h (65 mph). [CLS] [SEP] After moving ashore, Gwenda abruptly stalled before dissipating on 8 April. [CLS] [SEP] Although it was once an extremely intense cyclone, the factors that caused its deterioration also prevented significant damage. [CLS] [SEP] Rainfall from the storm peaked at 205 mm (8.1 in). [CLS] [SEP] Minor structural damage was reported, and only localised flooding was recorded. [CLS] [SEP] Following its usage, the name Gwenda was retired at the end of the season. [CLS] [SEP]
