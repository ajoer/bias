[CLS] The 2010 Mount Meager landslide was a large catastrophic debris avalanche that occurred in southwestern British Columbia, Canada, on August 6 at 3:27 a.m. [SEP] [CLS] PDT (UTC-7). [SEP] [CLS] More than 45,000,000 m3 (1.6Ã—109 cu ft) of debris slid down Mount Meager, temporarily blocking Meager Creek and destroying local bridges, roads and equipment. [SEP] [CLS] It was one of the largest landslides in Canadian history and one of over 20 landslides to have occurred from the Mount Meager massif in the last 10,000 years. [SEP] [CLS] Although voluminous, there were no fatalities caused by the event due in part to its remote and uninhabited location. [SEP] [CLS] The landslide was large enough to send seismic waves more than 2,000 km (1,200 mi) away into the neighbouring U.S. [SEP] [CLS] states of Alaska and Washington and beyond. [SEP] [CLS] Multiple factors led to the slide: Mount Meager's weak slopes have left it in a constant state of instability. [SEP] [CLS]
