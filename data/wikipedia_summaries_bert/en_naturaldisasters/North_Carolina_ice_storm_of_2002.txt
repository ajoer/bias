[CLS] The North Carolina ice storm of 2002 caused up to an inch of freezing rain from December 4â€“5 in central North Carolina. [SEP] [CLS] A total of 24 people were killed, and as many as 1.8 million people were left without electricity on December 6. [SEP] [CLS] Power outages began December 4, and power was not completely restored until December 14. [SEP] [CLS] Raleigh received the most freezing rain from a single storm since 1948, and Bristol, Tennessee received the most ice it had seen in 28 years. [SEP] [CLS] The storm also produced heavy rain in both the mountains and coastal plain of North Carolina. [SEP] [CLS] Much of the Southern Plains and the Northeast received snow with this system. [SEP] [CLS] During the power outages many residents used propane and kerosene powered generators and heaters to combat the cold, with some resorting to moving charcoal grills indoors to heat their households. [SEP] [CLS] The increased usage of these heating methods, particularly grills led to a substantial number of cases of carbon monoxide poisoning. [SEP] [CLS] Varying reports allege 48 to 200 cases of poisoning. [SEP] [CLS] Hispanic residents were disproportionately affected by the impacts of the ice storm, sustaining 23% of total injuries and 65% of carbon monoxide poisonings during the storm period.
