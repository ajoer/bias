[CLS] Cyclone Geralda (also known as Intense Tropical Cyclone Geralda) was a powerful tropical cyclone that caused catastrophic damage in Madagascar in late January 1994, among the strongest to hit the country. [SEP] [CLS] It originated from an area of low pressure over the Indian Ocean on January 25. [SEP] [CLS] Over the following few days, the depression underwent gradual intensification, reaching its peak intensity with ten-minute sustained winds of 200 km/h (125 mph) on January 31. [SEP] [CLS] Cyclone Geralda made landfall near Toamasina, Madagascar after weakening from its peak intensity. [SEP] [CLS] Within hours of moving onshore, the system had substantially weakened, and by February 5, Geralda had degenerated into a land depression, and it became extratropical three days later. [SEP] [CLS] Geralda was the second cyclone in as many months to strike eastern Madagascar, after Daisy in January. [SEP] [CLS] Geralda produced wind gusts as strong as 350 km/h (220 mph), which were the highest worldwide for several decades. [SEP] [CLS] The cyclone also dropped heavy rainfall that caused flooding, particularly in valleys. [SEP] [CLS] About 80% of the city of Toamasina was destroyed, including most schools, homes, and churches. [SEP] [CLS] The cyclone heavily damaged roads and rail lines, which later disrupted relief efforts. [SEP] [CLS] In the capital Antananarivo, Geralda killed 43 people after flooding many houses. [SEP] [CLS] Overall, more than 40,000 homes were destroyed, leaving 356,000 people homeless. [SEP] [CLS] Nationwide, the cyclone killed 231 people and caused over $10 million in damage (1994 USD). [SEP] [CLS] Relief work in the storm's aftermath was hampered by lack of coordination, and the Malagasy military were deployed to help storm victims. [SEP] [CLS] Few stocks were pre-positioned, causing food prices to rise greatly. [SEP] [CLS] Several countries and departments of the United Nations donated money or supplies to the country.
