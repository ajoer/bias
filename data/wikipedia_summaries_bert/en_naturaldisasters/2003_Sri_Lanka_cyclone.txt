[SEP] [CLS] The first storm of the 2003 North Indian Ocean cyclone season, it developed over the Bay of Bengal on May 10.

[SEP] [CLS] The storm reached peak maximum sustained winds of 140 km/h (85 mph) on May 13, making it a very severe cyclonic storm according to the India Meteorological Department (IMD), which is the official Regional Specialized Meteorological Center for the basin. [SEP] [CLS] The cyclone drifted north over the central Bay of Bengal, gradually weakening due to heightened wind shear.
