Bartholomew JoJo Simpson is a fictional character in the American animated television series The Simpsons and part of the Simpson family. [CLS] [SEP] He is voiced by Nancy Cartwright and first appeared on television in The Tracey Ullman Show short "Good Night" on April 19, 1987. [CLS] [SEP] Cartoonist Matt Groening created and designed Bart while waiting in the lobby of James L. [CLS] [SEP] Brooks' office. [CLS] [SEP] Groening had been called to pitch a series of shorts based on his comic strip, Life in Hell, but instead decided to create a new set of characters. [CLS] [SEP] While the rest of the characters were named after Groening's family members, Bart's name is an anagram of the word brat. [CLS] [SEP] After appearing on The Tracey Ullman Show for three years, the Simpson family received its own series on Fox, which debuted December 17, 1989. [CLS] [SEP] Bart has appeared in every Simpsons episode except "Four Great Women and a Manicure". [CLS] [SEP] At ten years old, Bart is the eldest child and only son of Homer and Marge, and the brother of Lisa and Maggie. [CLS] [SEP] Bart's most prominent and popular character traits are his mischievousness, rebelliousness and disrespect for authority. [CLS] [SEP] Hallmarks of the character include his chalkboard gags in the opening sequence; his prank calls to Moe; and his catchphrases "Eat my shorts", "¡Ay, caramba!", "Don't have a cow, man!", and "I'm Bart Simpson. [CLS] [SEP] Who the hell are you?". [CLS] [SEP] However, the exception of "Ay, caramba!", these hallmarks have been retired or not often used. [CLS] [SEP] Bart has appeared in other media relating to The Simpsons – including video games, The Simpsons Movie, The Simpsons Ride, commercials, and comic books – and inspired an entire line of merchandise. [CLS] [SEP] In casting, Cartwright originally planned to audition for the role of Lisa, while Yeardley Smith tried out for Bart. [CLS] [SEP] Smith's voice was too high for a boy, so she was given the role of Lisa. [CLS] [SEP] Cartwright found that Lisa was not interesting at the time, so instead auditioned for Bart, which she thought was a better role.During the first two seasons of The Simpsons, Bart was the show's breakout character and "Bartmania" ensued, spawning Bart Simpson-themed merchandise touting his rebellious attitude and pride at underachieving, which caused many parents and educators to cast him as a bad role model for children. [CLS] [SEP] Around the third season, the series started to focus more on the family as a whole, though Bart still remains a prominent character. [CLS] [SEP] Time named Bart one of the 100 most important people of the 20th century, and he was named "entertainer of the year" in 1990 by Entertainment Weekly. [CLS] [SEP] Cartwright has won several awards for voicing Bart, including a Primetime Emmy Award in 1992 and an Annie Award in 1995. [CLS] [SEP] In 2000, Bart, along with the rest of his family, was awarded a star on the Hollywood Walk of Fame. [CLS] [SEP]
