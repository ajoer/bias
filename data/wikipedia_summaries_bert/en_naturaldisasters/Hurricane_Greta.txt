Hurricane Greta–Olivia was one of ten named Atlantic hurricanes to cross over Central America into the eastern Pacific while remaining a tropical cyclone. [CLS] [SEP] The seventh named storm of the 1978 Atlantic hurricane season, Greta formed from a tropical wave just northwest of Trinidad on September 13, and despite being in a climatologically unfavorable area, gradually intensified while moving west-northwestward. [CLS] [SEP] On September 16, it became a hurricane south of Jamaica. [CLS] [SEP] Two days later, the well-defined eye approached northeastern Honduras but veered to the northwest. [CLS] [SEP] After reaching peak winds of 130 mph (215 km/h) that day, Greta weakened while paralleling the northern Honduras coast just offshore. [CLS] [SEP] On September 19, it made landfall on Belize near Dangriga and quickly weakened into a tropical depression while crossing Guatemala and southeastern Mexico. [CLS] [SEP] After entering the eastern Pacific, the system re-intensified into a hurricane and was renamed Olivia, which weakened before dissipating over Chiapas on September 23. [CLS] [SEP] Taking a similar path to Hurricane Fifi four years prior, Greta threatened to reproduce the devastating effects of the catastrophic storm; however, damage and loss of life was significantly less than feared. [CLS] [SEP] In Honduras, about 1,200 homes were damaged, about half of which in towns along the coastline. [CLS] [SEP] The storm damaged about 75% of the houses on Roatán along the offshore Bay Islands, and there was one death in the country. [CLS] [SEP] In the Belize Barrier Reef, Greta downed trees and produced high waves, while on the mainland, there was minimal flooding despite a high storm surge. [CLS] [SEP] In Dangriga where it made landfall, the hurricane damaged or destroyed 125 houses and the primary hospital. [CLS] [SEP] In Belize City, a tornado flipped over a truck and damaged four houses. [CLS] [SEP] Damage in Belize was estimated at $25 million (1978 USD), and there were four deaths. [CLS] [SEP]
