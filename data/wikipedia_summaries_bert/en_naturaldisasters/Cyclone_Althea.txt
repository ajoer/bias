[CLS] Severe Tropical Cyclone Althea was a powerful tropical cyclone that devastated parts of North Queensland just before Christmas 1971. [SEP] [CLS] One of the strongest storms ever to affect the Townsville area, Althea was the fourth system and second severe tropical cyclone of the 1971–72 Australian region cyclone season. [SEP] [CLS] After forming near the Solomon Islands on 19 December and heading southwest across the Coral Sea, the storm reached its peak intensity with 10-minute average maximum sustained winds of 130 km/h (80 mph) – Category 3 on the Australian cyclone scale. [SEP] [CLS] At 09:00 AEST on Christmas Eve, Althea struck the coast of Queensland near Rollingstone, about 50 km (30 mi) north of Townsville. [SEP] [CLS] Although early weather satellites provided only occasional glimpses into the cyclone's formative stages, its landfall was monitored closely by land-based radar that depicted an ongoing eyewall replacement cycle. [SEP] [CLS] Althea produced copious rainfall over central and western Queensland as it turned toward the southeast, and on 26 December the cyclone emerged over open waters. [SEP] [CLS] After briefly re-intensifying, the system dissipated on 29 December. [SEP] [CLS] While moving ashore, Althea generated wind gusts as high as 215 km/h (134 mph) that wrought significant destruction around Townsville and left nearby Magnetic Island in a state of ruin; almost all of the buildings on the island were damaged to some degree. [SEP] [CLS] A significant 3.66 m (12.0 ft) storm surge battered the mainland, while high waves destroyed roads and seawalls. [SEP] [CLS] Beaches receded by up to 15.8 m (52 ft) due to coastal erosion. [SEP] [CLS] In Townsville, thousands of homes were damaged and many were destroyed. [SEP] [CLS] The most widespread damage was to roofs, which were often poorly or not at all secured. [SEP] [CLS] The damage from Althea prompted Queensland to develop its first statewide building codes, requiring new homes to be cyclone-resistant. [SEP] [CLS] Townsville was the first community to adopt the enhanced construction standards. [SEP] [CLS] In addition to the coastal effects, Althea triggered extensive river flooding in interior Queensland. [SEP] [CLS] Most major roads in western portions of the state were cut off by floodwaters, and hundreds of families had to leave their homes for higher ground. [SEP] [CLS] In the aftermath of the cyclone, 600 Australian Army soldiers aided recovery efforts in Townsville and Magnetic Island, while both state and federal governments contributed disaster relief funds. [SEP] [CLS] Three people were killed and damage totaled $120 million (1971 AUD). [SEP] [CLS]
