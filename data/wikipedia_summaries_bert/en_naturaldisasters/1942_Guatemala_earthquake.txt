[SEP] [CLS] The epicenter was located off the southern coast of Guatemala, and it was one of the strongest earthquakes ever recorded there. [SEP] [CLS] The earthquake caused widespread damage in the west-central highlands of Guatemala. [SEP] [CLS] Thirty-eight people died in the earthquake.

[SEP] [CLS] The earthquake could also be felt strongly in Mexico and El Salvador.This earthquake was a lower crustal intraplate earthquake with a compressional focal mechanism. [SEP] [CLS] Tensional activity has been dominant along the down-dip edge along the 1942 rupture zone. [SEP] [CLS] It was estimated that earthquakes near the Middle America Trench with magnitudes of about 7.5~8.0 occurred at intervals of 94 ± 54 yrs in southwestern Guatemala. [SEP] [CLS] Such historical earthquakes included the earthquakes in 1765, 1902, and 1942. [SEP] [CLS]
