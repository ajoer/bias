The February flood of 1825, also known in Germany as the Great Hallig Flood (Gro√üe Halligflut), was a devastating flood that occurred from 3 to 5 February 1825 on the North Sea coast, in which about 800 people were drowned. [CLS] [SEP] Particularly affected was the North Sea coast of Jutland, Slesvig and Germany. [CLS] [SEP] The sand spit Agger Tange was broken through and the Limfjord got its western opening to the sea. [CLS] [SEP] Henceforth, North Jutland has been an island. [CLS] [SEP] In North Frisia the unprotected islets, known as Halligen, were hit. [CLS] [SEP] Many dykes had already been damaged in November of the year before by a severe storm surge. [CLS] [SEP] The island of Pellworm was completely flooded. [CLS] [SEP] In East Frisia, the town of Emden was particularly hard hit. [CLS] [SEP] But because the levees in the East Frisian area had been raised significantly in many places in the preceding years, the number of casualties - about 200 - was less than it might have been. [CLS] [SEP] In the Netherlands, the February flood was the worst natural disaster of the 19th century. [CLS] [SEP] Most of the dead and the worst damage was in Groningen, Friesland and Overijssel. [CLS] [SEP] The reaction at national level was quite similar to that during the flood of 1953; yet the event was surprisingly quickly forgotten once the damage had been repaired and had no political or engineering consequences. [CLS] [SEP] It needed the disaster of 1953 in order for a delta law to be passed and to improve coastal protection significantly. [CLS] [SEP]
