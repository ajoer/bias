Typhoon Yunya, known in the Philippines as Typhoon Diding, was a strong tropical cyclone that struck the Philippines at the time of the colossal eruption of Mount Pinatubo in June 1991. [CLS] [SEP] A small tropical cyclone, Yunya rapidly developed from a tropical disturbance near East Samar on June 11. [CLS] [SEP] By June 13 the storm had reached typhoon status as it moved west-northwest near the Philippines. [CLS] [SEP] Yunya attained its peak intensity the following day with estimated winds of 145 km/h (90 mph); however, strong wind shear soon impacted the typhoon and caused it to rapidly decay. [CLS] [SEP] The storm struck southern Luzon early on June 15 as a minimal typhoon before moving over the South China Sea later that day. [CLS] [SEP] After turning north and weakening to a tropical depression, the system brushed the southern tip of Taiwan on June 16 before dissipating the following day. [CLS] [SEP] Across the Philippines, Yunya produced heavy rains that triggered significant flooding. [CLS] [SEP] Hundreds of homes and several bridges were washed away by swollen rivers. [CLS] [SEP] Six people were killed as a direct result of the storm, 2,013 homes were destroyed, and 24 others were damaged. [CLS] [SEP] Although the storm itself caused significant damage, the worst effects were related to the system's heavy rains mixing with volcanic ash from Mount Pinatubo, creating massive lahars that killed 320 people.
