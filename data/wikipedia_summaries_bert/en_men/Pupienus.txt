[CLS] Pupienus (Marcus Clodius Pupienus Maximus; born c. [SEP] [CLS] 165/170 â€“ 29 July 238) was Roman emperor with Balbinus for three months in 238, during the Year of the Six Emperors. [SEP] [CLS] The sources for this period are scant, and thus knowledge of the emperor is limited. [SEP] [CLS] In most contemporary texts Pupienus is referred to by his cognomen "Maximus" rather than by his second nomen (family name) Pupienus. [SEP] [CLS]
