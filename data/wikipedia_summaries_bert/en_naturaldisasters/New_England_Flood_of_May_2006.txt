[CLS] The New England Flood of May 2006, often locally referred to as the Mother's Day Flood, was a flood event that occurred in New England, especially in New Hampshire and Massachusetts, during the month of May, 2006. [SEP] [CLS] It started on May 11, 2006 as a result of an unusually strong low pressure system that stalled over the central United States, drawing copious amounts of moisture from the Atlantic Ocean. [SEP] [CLS] Most of this moisture was drawn directly over New England, producing continuous heavy rain that led to record flooding near several rivers. [SEP] [CLS] It was described as the worst flooding since the New England Hurricane of 1938. [SEP] [CLS] There were at least two fatalities, both in Topsfield, Massachusetts. [SEP] [CLS] Some called it the Mother's Day Flood, since it occurred on that holiday. [SEP] [CLS]
