[CLS] Hurricane Camille was the second most intense tropical cyclone on record to strike the United States. [SEP] [CLS] The most intense storm of the 1969 Atlantic hurricane season, Camille originated as a tropical depression on August 14, south of Cuba, from a long-tracked tropical wave. [SEP] [CLS] Located in a favorable environment for strengthening, the storm quickly intensified into a Category 2 hurricane before striking the western part of Cuba on August 15. [SEP] [CLS] Emerging into the Gulf of Mexico, Camille underwent another period of rapid intensification and became a Category 5 hurricane the next day as it moved northward towards the Louisianaâ€“Mississippi region. [SEP] [CLS] Despite weakening slightly on August 17, the hurricane quickly re-intensified back into a Category 5 hurricane before it made landfall a half-hour before midnight in Bay St. [SEP] [CLS] Louis, Mississippi. [SEP] [CLS] At peak intensity, the hurricane had a minimum pressure of 900 mbar (26.58 inHg). [SEP] [CLS] This was the second-lowest pressure recorded for a U.S. [SEP] [CLS] landfall, and is one of just four hurricanes to make landfall in the U.S at Category 5 status. [SEP] [CLS] Only the 1935 Labor Day hurricane had a lower pressure at landfall. [SEP] [CLS] As Camille pushed inland, it quickly weakened and was a tropical depression by the time it was over the Ohio Valley. [SEP] [CLS] Once it emerged offshore, Camille was able to restrengthen to a strong tropical storm, before it became extratropical on August 22. [SEP] [CLS] Camille was subsequently absorbed by a frontal storm over the North Atlantic on the same day. [SEP] [CLS] Camille caused tremendous damage in its wake, and produced a peak official storm surge of 24 feet (7.3 m). [SEP] [CLS] The hurricane flattened nearly everything along the coast of the U.S. [SEP] [CLS] state of Mississippi, and caused additional flooding and deaths inland while crossing the Appalachian Mountains of Virginia. [SEP] [CLS] In the U.S., Camille killed more than 259 people and caused $1.42 billion in damages (equivalent to $9.9 billion in 2019). [SEP] [CLS]
