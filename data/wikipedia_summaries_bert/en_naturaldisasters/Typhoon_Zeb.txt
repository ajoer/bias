Typhoon Zeb, known in the Philippines as Typhoon Iliang, was a powerful typhoon that struck the island of Luzon in October 1998. [CLS] [SEP] The tenth tropical storm of the season, Zeb formed on October 10 from the monsoon trough near the Caroline Islands. [CLS] [SEP] It moved westward initially and quickly intensified. [CLS] [SEP] Zeb's inflow briefly spawned another tropical storm, which it ultimately absorbed. [CLS] [SEP] Developing an eye, Zeb rapidly intensified into a super typhoon, officially reaching maximum sustained winds of 205 km/h (125 mph); one warning agency estimated winds as high as 285 km/h (180 mph). [CLS] [SEP] After reaching peak intensity, the typhoon struck northern Luzon and quickly weakened over land. [CLS] [SEP] Turning to the north, Zeb brushed the east coast of Taiwan at a reduced intensity, and after accelerating to the northeast it moved through Japan. [CLS] [SEP] It became extratropical on October 18 and moved eastward over open waters. [CLS] [SEP] First affecting the Philippines, Zeb dropped torrential rainfall in Luzon, reaching 1,116 millimetres (43.9 inches) in one day in La Trinidad, estimated as a one-in-1,147-year event. [CLS] [SEP] The rains caused floods and landslides, which compounded with high winds to leave heavy crop damage. [CLS] [SEP] Zeb destroyed or damaged 85,844 houses in the Philippines, and damage in the country was estimated at â‚±5.375 billion (1998 Philippine pesos, $126 million U.S. [CLS] [SEP] dollars), the fifth-costliest at the time. [CLS] [SEP] There were also 83 deaths in the country, a number compounded upon when Typhoon Babs struck the same region a week later. [CLS] [SEP] High winds and rainfall from Zeb later affected Taiwan, causing NT$4.15 billion (New Taiwan dollar, $125 million USD) in damage as well as 31 deaths. [CLS] [SEP] Gusty winds affected much of Japan, while heavy rainfall peaked at 586 mm (23.1 in) on Mount Ontake. [CLS] [SEP] The storm killed 14 people in the country, several related to landslides. [CLS] [SEP] Zeb destroyed 770 homes and flooded another 12,548 in Japan. [CLS] [SEP]
