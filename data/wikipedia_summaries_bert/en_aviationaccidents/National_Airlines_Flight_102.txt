[CLS] [SEP] On 29 April 2013, the Boeing 747-400 operating the flight crashed moments after taking off from Bagram, killing all seven people on board.The subsequent investigation concluded that improperly secured cargo broke free during the take-off and rolled to the back of the cargo hold, crashing through the rear pressure bulkhead and disabling the rear flight control systems. [CLS] [SEP] This rendered the aircraft uncontrollable, making recovery from a stall brought on by a change of balance from the shifted cargo impossible. [CLS] [SEP]
