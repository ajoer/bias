Hurricane Omar was a powerful tropical cyclone that took an unusual southwest to northeast track through the eastern Caribbean Sea during mid-October 2008. [CLS] [SEP] Forming out of a tropical disturbance on October 13, Omar initially moved slowly in the eastern Caribbean Sea. [CLS] [SEP] By October 15, Omar began to quickly intensify as deep convection developed around the center of circulation. [CLS] [SEP] Later that day, an eye developed and the storm began to accelerate to the northeast. [CLS] [SEP] Early on October 16, Omar reached its peak intensity with maximum winds of 130 mph (215 km/h) and a barometric pressure of 958 mbar (hPa; 28.29 inHg). [CLS] [SEP] Shortly after, the hurricane rapidly weakened to Category 1 intensity. [CLS] [SEP] After slightly re-strengthening the next day, Omar weakened to a tropical storm before degenerating into a non-convective low pressure area. [CLS] [SEP] The remnants of Omar persisted until October 21, at which time they dissipated to the west of the Azores. [CLS] [SEP] Throughout the eastern Caribbean, Omar affected numerous islands, most of which only recorded minor impacts. [CLS] [SEP] Large swells and heavy rains impacted the ABC islands. [CLS] [SEP] Antigua and Barbuda sustained $54 million in damages, mainly on Antigua as nine homes were destroyed, several others damaged and many farms were inundated by flood waters. [CLS] [SEP] One person died in Puerto Rico after suffering a stress-induced cardiac arrest. [CLS] [SEP] The United States Virgin Islands also sustained significant damage, costing roughly $6 million. [CLS] [SEP] Numerous boats and homes were damaged and over 100 power poles were snapped. [CLS] [SEP] Total losses from the storm were estimated at $79 million. [CLS] [SEP]
