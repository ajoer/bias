Daraisung Guden Khan (Mongolian: Дарайсүн гүдэн хаан; Chinese: 打來孫; 1520–1557) or Darayisung Gudeng Khan was the Mongol Khan of the Northern Yuan dynasty based in Mongolia. [CLS] [SEP] He was the eldest son of Bodi Alagh Khan, whom he succeeded as Khan. [CLS] [SEP] During his rule, Altan Khan became stronger and more disrespectful of the power of the Great Khan and Daraisung Khan was unable to achieve victory in their conflicts. [CLS] [SEP] Altan Khan forced Daraisung Guden Khan to flee eastward. [CLS] [SEP] Four years later in 1551, Daraisung made a compromise with Altan accepting Altan's leadership in exchange for giving the title "Gegeen Khan" to him. [CLS] [SEP] As a result, Daraisung Guden Khan was forced to relocate his imperial court to the east near Manchuria, and the power of the Great Khan began to decline. [CLS] [SEP] Although most Mongol nobles still recognized the Great Khan as the leader, it was in name only and two Borjin nobles declare themselves as khans of their own turfs. [CLS] [SEP] With the decline of a unified Mongol state, his great-grandson, Ligden Khan, the last Borjigin Khan of Mongolia, eventually became known as Ligden of the Chahar, and eventually was subjugated by the Qing dynasty.
