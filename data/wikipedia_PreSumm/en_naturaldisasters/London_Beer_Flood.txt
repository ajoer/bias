[CLS] The London Beer Flood was an accident at Meux & Co's Horse Shoe Brewery, London, on 17 October 1814. [SEP] [CLS] It took place when one of the 22-foot-tall (6.7 m) wooden vats of fermenting porter burst. [SEP] [CLS] The pressure destroyed another vessel, and between 128,000 and 323,000 imperial gallons (580,000–1,470,000 l; 154,000–388,000 US gal) of beer were released. [SEP] [CLS] The resulting wave of porter destroyed the back wall of the brewery and swept into an area of slum-dwellings known as the St Giles rookery. [SEP] [CLS] Eight people were killed, five of them mourners at the wake being held by an Irish family for a two-year-old boy. [SEP] [CLS] The coroner's inquest returned a verdict that the eight had lost their lives "casually, accidentally and by misfortune". [SEP] [CLS] The brewery was nearly bankrupted by the event; it avoided collapse after a rebate from HM Excise on the lost beer. [SEP] [CLS] The brewing industry gradually stopped using large wooden vats after the accident. [SEP] [CLS] The brewery moved in 1921, and the Dominion Theatre is now where the brewery used to stand. [SEP] [CLS] Meux & Co went into liquidation in 1961. [SEP] [CLS]
