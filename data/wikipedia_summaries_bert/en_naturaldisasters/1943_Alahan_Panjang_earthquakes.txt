[SEP] [CLS] The magnitude was given as Mw 7.5, or Ms 7.4.Alahan Panjang was damaged in the earthquakes. [SEP] [CLS] Right lateral offsets were reported near the town of Solok.Near the Sumani segment, earthquake doublets occurred repeatedly. [SEP] [CLS] Similar earthquake doublet nearby include the earthquakes in 1926 and 2007. [SEP] [CLS]
