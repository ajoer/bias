Gace Brulé (c. [CLS] [SEP] 1160 – after 1213), French trouvère, was a native of Champagne. [CLS] [SEP] His name is simply a description of his blazonry. [CLS] [SEP] He owned land in Groslière and had dealings with the Knights Templar, and received a gift from the future Louis VIII. [CLS] [SEP] These facts are known from documents from the time. [CLS] [SEP] The rest of his history has been extracted from his poetry. [CLS] [SEP] It has generally been asserted that he taught Thibaut of Champagne the art of verse, an assumption which is based on a statement in the Chroniques de Saint-Denis: "Si l'est entre lui [Thibaut] et Gace Brulé les plus belles chançons et les plus delitables et melodieuses qui onque fussent ales." This has been taken as evidence of collaboration between the two poets. [CLS] [SEP] The passage will bear the interpretation that with those of Gace the songs of Thibaut were the best hitherto known. [CLS] [SEP] Paulin Paris, in the Histoire littéraire de la France (vol. [CLS] [SEP] xxiii.), quotes a number of facts that fix an earlier date for Gace's songs. [CLS] [SEP] Some scholars believe that Gace is the author of the earliest known jeu parti, although the early twentieth-century editor of the jeux partis, Arthur Langfors, considered this to be a misattribution, based on discrepancies between manuscripts. [CLS] [SEP] The interlocutors are Gace and a count of Brittany who is identified with Geoffrey of Brittany, son of Henry II of England. [CLS] [SEP] Gace appears to have been banished from Champagne and to have found refuge in Brittany. [CLS] [SEP] A deed dated 1212 attests a contract between Gatho Bruslé (Gace Ernie) and the Templars for a piece of land in Dreux. [CLS] [SEP] It seems most probable that Gace died before 1220, at the latest in 1225. [CLS] [SEP] See Gedeon Busken Huet, Chansons de Gace Brulé, edited for the Société des anciens textes français (1902), with an exhaustive introduction. [CLS] [SEP] Dante quotes a song by Gace, Ire d'amor qui en mon over repaire, which he attributes erroneously to Thibaut of Champagne (De vulgari eloquentia, p. [CLS] [SEP] 151, ed. [CLS] [SEP] P Rajna, Florence, 1895). [CLS] [SEP]
