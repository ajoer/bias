Typhoon Karen was the most powerful tropical cyclone to strike the island of Guam, and has been regarded as one of the most destructive events in the island's history. [CLS] [SEP] It was first identified as a tropical disturbance on November 6, 1962, well to the southeast of Truk. [CLS] [SEP] Over the following two days, the system tracked generally northward and quickly intensified. [CLS] [SEP] Karen became a tropical storm late on November 7, and within two days it explosively intensified into a Category 5-equivalent super typhoon on the Saffirâ€“Simpson scale. [CLS] [SEP] Turning westward, the typhoon maintained its intensity and struck Guam with winds of 280 km/h (175 mph) on November 11. [CLS] [SEP] Once clear of the island, it strengthened slightly and reached its peak intensity on November 13 with winds of 295 km/h (185 mph) and a barometric pressure of 894 mb (hPa; 26.40 inHg). [CLS] [SEP] The storm then gradually turned northward as it weakened, brushing the Ryukyu Islands on November 15, before moving east-northeastward over the open waters of the Pacific. [CLS] [SEP] Karen continued to weaken and transitioned into an extratropical cyclone on November 17 before losing its identity the following day between Alaska and Hawaii. [CLS] [SEP] Karen devastated Guam with wind gusts estimated up to 280 km/h (185 mph). [CLS] [SEP] Ninety-five percent of homes were damaged or destroyed, leaving at least 45,000 people homeless. [CLS] [SEP] Communication and utilities were crippled, forcing officials to set up water distribution centers to prevent disease. [CLS] [SEP] Total losses on the island amounted to $250 million. [CLS] [SEP] Despite the severity of the damage, only 11 people were killed. [CLS] [SEP] In the wake of the storm, a massive relief operation evacuated thousands to California, Hawaii, and Wake Island. [CLS] [SEP] Thousands more were sheltered in public buildings, and later tent villages, for many months. [CLS] [SEP] More than $60 million in relief funds were sent to Guam over the following years to aid in rehabilitation. [CLS] [SEP] Though the storm was devastating, it spurred new building codes and a revitalized economy. [CLS] [SEP]
