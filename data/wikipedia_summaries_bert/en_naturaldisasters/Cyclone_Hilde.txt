[CLS] 2013 Nordic storms were a series of storms affecting predominantly the Nordic nations with other northern European nations also affected. [SEP] [CLS] The first storm in the series Hilde, named Otto by Free University of Berlin, and Eino in Finland was an extratropical cyclone affecting parts of northern Europe, causing disruption to electricity supplies and transportation across mid Norway, northern Sweden and central Finland during 15â€“18 November 2013. [SEP] [CLS] The storm brought a new record average wind speed to Sweden (at altitude), however wind speeds at lower altitudes were less than seen during Cyclone Dagmar of 2011. [SEP] [CLS] Most damage was caused by falling trees along the storm's path likely exacerbated by unfrozen ground. [SEP] [CLS] The total cost of damage is likely to be low, as the storm passed over relatively unpopulated regions of the Nordic nations. [SEP] [CLS]
