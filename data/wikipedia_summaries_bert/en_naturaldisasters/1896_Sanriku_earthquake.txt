The 1896 Sanriku earthquake (明治三陸地震, Meiji Sanriku Jishin) was one of the most destructive seismic events in Japanese history. [CLS] [SEP] The 8.5 magnitude earthquake occurred at 19:32 (local time) on June 15, 1896, approximately 166 kilometres (103 mi) off the coast of Iwate Prefecture, Honshu. [CLS] [SEP] It resulted in two tsunamis which destroyed about 9,000 homes and caused at least 22,000 deaths. [CLS] [SEP] The waves reached a then-record height of 38.2 metres (125 ft); this would remain the highest on record until waves from the 2011 Tōhoku earthquake exceeded that height by more than 2 metres (6 ft 7 in).Seismologists have discovered the tsunami's magnitude (Mt = 8.2) was much greater than expected for the estimated seismic magnitude. [CLS] [SEP] This earthquake is now regarded as being part of a distinct class of seismic events, the tsunami earthquake. [CLS] [SEP]
