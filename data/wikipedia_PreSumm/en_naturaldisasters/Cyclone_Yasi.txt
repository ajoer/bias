[CLS] Severe Tropical Cyclone Yasi was a powerful and destructive tropical cyclone that made landfall in northern Queensland, Australia in early 2011, causing major damage to the affected areas. [SEP] [CLS] Originating as a tropical low near Fiji on 26 January, the system intensified to tropical cyclone status during the evening of 30 January. [SEP] [CLS] Yasi deepened rapidly over the next 24 hours, and was classified as a Category 3 cyclone at about 5 PM AEST (07:00 UTC) on 31 January 2011. [SEP] [CLS] Late on 1 February, the cyclone strengthened to a Category 4 system; then, early on 2 February, the cyclone intensified into a Category 5 Severe Tropical Cyclone. [SEP] [CLS] The system had a well-defined eye and continued to track west-southwestward, maintaining a central pressure of 930 hPa (27 inHg) and a Dvorak intensity of T6.5 into the evening.At about 12:00 AM AEST (14:00 UTC) on 3 February, Yasi crossed the Australian coastline as a Category 5 severe tropical cyclone near Mission Beach, with estimated maximum 3-second gusts of 285 km/h spanning an area from Ingham to Cairns. [SEP] [CLS] A record low pressure of 929 hPa (27.43 inHg) was measured as the eye passed over Tully. [SEP] [CLS] Due to the size of the system and its strong core, Yasi maintained cyclonic intensity farther inland than normal, finally dissipating into a tropical low near Mount Isa, at 10 PM on 3 February 2011, 22 hours after the storm first crossed the coast. [SEP] [CLS] The storm caused an estimated AU$3.5 billion (US$3.6 billion) in damage, making it the costliest tropical cyclone to hit Australia on record (not accounting for inflation; otherwise, Cyclone Tracy was costlier). [SEP] [CLS] Yasi was also indirectly responsible for the death of a 23-year-old man, who died from suffocation by generator exhaust fumes.Tropical Cyclone Yasi was the biggest storm in Queensland's history, with more than 10,000 people moved from their homes. [SEP] [CLS] The storm passed between the two big cities of Cairns and Townsville which only suffered minor damage. [SEP] [CLS] Early estimates of damage put the cost at about AU$100 million. [SEP] [CLS] It did not cause as much damage as government expected, as it missed major cities. [SEP] [CLS] It did however destroy 30% of the houses in Tully. [SEP] [CLS] At least 75% of the banana crop was destroyed, and damage to the sugar cane farms was expected to cost about AU$500 million. [SEP] [CLS] Damage to power lines left 150,000 homes without electricity. [SEP] [CLS]
