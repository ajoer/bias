[CLS] Charles John Huffam Dickens (; 7 February 1812 – 9 June 1870) was an English writer and social critic. [SEP] [CLS] He created some of the world's best-known fictional characters and is regarded by many as the greatest novelist of the Victorian era. [SEP] [CLS] His works enjoyed unprecedented popularity during his lifetime, and by the 20th century, critics and scholars had recognised him as a literary genius. [SEP] [CLS] His novels and short stories are still widely read today.Born in Portsmouth, Dickens left school to work in a factory when his father was incarcerated in a debtors' prison. [SEP] [CLS] Despite his lack of formal education, he edited a weekly journal for 20 years, wrote 15 novels, five novellas, hundreds of short stories and non-fiction articles, lectured and performed readings extensively, was an indefatigable letter writer, and campaigned vigorously for children's rights, education, and other social reforms. [SEP] [CLS] Dickens's literary success began with the 1836 serial publication of The Pickwick Papers. [SEP] [CLS] Within a few years he had become an international literary celebrity, famous for his humour, satire, and keen observation of character and society. [SEP] [CLS] His novels, most published in monthly or weekly instalments, pioneered the serial publication of narrative fiction, which became the dominant Victorian mode for novel publication. [SEP] [CLS] Cliffhanger endings in his serial publications kept readers in suspense. [SEP] [CLS] The installment format allowed Dickens to evaluate his audience's reaction, and he often modified his plot and character development based on such feedback. [SEP] [CLS] For example, when his wife's chiropodist expressed distress at the way Miss Mowcher in David Copperfield seemed to reflect her disabilities, Dickens improved the character with positive features. [SEP] [CLS] His plots were carefully constructed, and he often wove elements from topical events into his narratives. [SEP] [CLS] Masses of the illiterate poor chipped in ha'pennies to have each new monthly episode read to them, opening up and inspiring a new class of readers.His 1843 novella A Christmas Carol remains especially popular and continues to inspire adaptations in every artistic genre. [SEP] [CLS] Oliver Twist and Great Expectations are also frequently adapted and, like many of his novels, evoke images of early Victorian London. [SEP] [CLS] His 1859 novel A Tale of Two Cities (set in London and Paris) is his best-known work of historical fiction. [SEP] [CLS] The most famous celebrity of his era, he undertook, in response to public demand, a series of public reading tours in the later part of his career. [SEP] [CLS] Dickens has been praised by many of his fellow writers – from Leo Tolstoy to George Orwell, G. [SEP] [CLS] K. [SEP] [CLS] Chesterton, and Tom Wolfe – for his realism, comedy, prose style, unique characterisations, and social criticism. [SEP] [CLS] However, Oscar Wilde, Henry James, and Virginia Woolf complained of a lack of psychological depth, loose writing, and a vein of sentimentalism. [SEP] [CLS] The term Dickensian is used to describe something that is reminiscent of Dickens and his writings, such as poor social conditions or comically repulsive characters. [SEP] [CLS]
