[CLS] The 1985 Mendoza earthquake occurred with medium intensity in the province of Mendoza, Argentina. [SEP] [CLS] It took place 7 minutes after midnight on 26 January 1985, and had a magnitude of 6.2 in the Richter scale. [SEP] [CLS] Its epicenter was located about 45 km southwest of Mendoza, the provincial capital, at the southern end of the region's pre-Andes range, and at a depth of 15 km. [SEP] [CLS] It was felt as grade VIII in the Mercalli intensity scale. [SEP] [CLS] The earthquake caused 6 deaths and about 100 injuries. [SEP] [CLS] In the affected Greater Mendoza area, where most of the provincial population is concentrated, one third of the buildings were built of adobe. [SEP] [CLS] Some 23,000 homes were destroyed or condemned, though the actual number might have been larger. [SEP] [CLS] Estimates vary between 50,000 and 100,000 people left homeless. [SEP] [CLS] A report released soon afterwards stated that the main reason why the event did not produce thousands of casualties was its short duration (less than 10 seconds). [SEP] [CLS] In addition, the fact that it was a summer Friday night might have led many people to be sitting outside their homes, chatting with their neighbors, rather than sleeping inside.
