The 1997 Punitaqui earthquake occurred at 01:03 UTC on October 15. [CLS] [SEP] It had an estimated magnitude of 7.1 Mwc. [CLS] [SEP] This earthquake was one of the most destructive in the epicentral area compared to other events of subduction of the same size. [CLS] [SEP] The extensive damage to structures was the result of an amplification effect on the ground and the poor quality of building materials, this reflects the potential for damage incurred in an intraplate earthquake with vertical fault and how it can be much greater than what which can cause one of interplate of similar magnitude, and caused severe damage in Chilean cities of La Serena, Ovalle, Illapel and Punitaqui.
