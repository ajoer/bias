[CLS] Delbeg (ᠳᠡᠯᠪᠡᠭ, Дэлбэг, or Dalbag; Chinese: 答里巴; 1395–1415) was the Mongol Khan of the Northern Yuan dynasty based in Mongolia. [SEP] [CLS] The Oirats finally installed the young Delbeg in 1412 as their puppet Mongol Khan, but this was not recognized by most of Mongol clans in the central and eastern Mongol territories. [SEP] [CLS] According to Saghan Secen, Delbeg was a son of Öljei Temür Khan Buyanshir who had instructed the Oirat leader Bahamu to make Delbeg the new Khan. [SEP] [CLS] Delbeg became Khagan in 1412. [SEP] [CLS] Whatever of his origin, Delbeg was a direct descendant of Ariq Böke, and this blood lineage able to rally some support from Mongol populace in west. [SEP] [CLS] However, his authority only prevailed in less than a third of Mongol territory, the western parts, while the eastern and central parts were under the control of Arughtai, and the two sides fought continuously for more than two decades. [SEP] [CLS] The Oirats forced Arughtai to seek refuge in the lands near China in 1414. [SEP] [CLS] In 1415, the western Mongols led by Bahamu, Delbeg and Bolad were defeated by the Ming army which penetrated as far as Tuul River. [SEP] [CLS] However, it was a pyrrhic victory and the number of killed was about the same on both sides. [SEP] [CLS] The Ming Emperor was persuaded to return by his followers while the Mongols retired northwards. [SEP] [CLS] Although Adai Khan did not proclaim the throne of Great Khan until 1425, he was able to first unify the eastern part and then the central part of the Mongol territory while denouncing the legitimacy of Delbeg Khan, and carried on campaigns against Delbeg, eventually succeeding in defeating and killing Delbeg Khan in 1415, along with many of his Oirats supporters. [SEP] [CLS] Delbeg Khan was succeeded by another direct descendant of Ariq Böke, Oyiradai Khan, chosen by the Oirats to boost the legitimacy of their rule. [SEP] [CLS]
