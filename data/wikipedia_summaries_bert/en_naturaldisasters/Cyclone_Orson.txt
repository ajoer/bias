Severe Tropical Cyclone Orson was the fourth most intense cyclone ever recorded in the Australian region. [CLS] [SEP] Forming out of a tropical low on 17 April 1989, Orson gradually intensified as it tracked towards the west. [CLS] [SEP] After attaining Category 5 intensity on 20 April, the storm began to track southward and accelerated. [CLS] [SEP] The following day, the cyclone reached its peak intensity with winds of 250 km/h (155 mph 10-minute sustained) and a barometric pressure of 904 hPa (mbar). [CLS] [SEP] Orson maintained this intensity for nearly two days before making landfall near Dampier. [CLS] [SEP] The cyclone rapidly weakened after landfall as it accelerated to the southeast. [CLS] [SEP] After moving into the Great Australian Bight on 24 April, the storm dissipated. [CLS] [SEP] Despite Orson's extreme intensity, damage was relatively minimal as it struck a sparsely populated region of Western Australia. [CLS] [SEP] Five people were killed offshore and damages amounted to A$20 million (US$16.8 million). [CLS] [SEP] The storm damaged a new gas platform, delaying the project for nearly two weeks.
