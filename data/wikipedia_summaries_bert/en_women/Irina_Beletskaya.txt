Irina Petrovna Beletskaya (Russian: Ири́на Петро́вна Беле́цкая) (born 1933) is a professor of chemistry at Moscow State University. [CLS] [SEP] She specialises in organometallic chemistry and its application to problems in organic chemistry. [CLS] [SEP] She is best known for her studies on aromatic reaction mechanisms, as well as work on carbanion acidity and reactivity. [CLS] [SEP] She developed some of the first methods for carbon-carbon bond formation using palladium or nickel catalysts, and extended these reactions to work in aqueous media. [CLS] [SEP] She also helped to open up the chemistry of organolanthanides. [CLS] [SEP]
