[CLS] Intense Tropical Cyclone Hondo (JTWC designation: 16S) was the strongest and longest lived tropical cyclone to develop during the 2007–08 South-West Indian Ocean cyclone season. [SEP] [CLS] The third tropical cyclone and first intense tropical cyclone of the season, Hondo developed out of a tropical disturbance in early February about 1,020 km (635 mi) east-southeast of Diego Garcia. [SEP] [CLS] The disturbance quickly strengthened, becoming a moderate tropical storm on February 4 and a severe tropical storm the following day. [SEP] [CLS] After a brief period of slower intensification, Hondo rapidly intensified into an intense tropical cyclone and reached its peak intensity with winds of 215 km/h (130 mph 10-minute winds) on February 7. [SEP] [CLS] The cyclone gradually weakened over the next several days due to an increase in forward speed and a decrease in sea surface temperatures. [SEP] [CLS] On February 12, Hondo rapidly degenerated into a remnant-low pressure area. [SEP] [CLS] Over the following week, the remnant low traveled in a general west-northwest direction with no development. [SEP] [CLS] On February 20, about 2,780 km (1,725 mi) northeast of where the final advisories were issued, the storm began to regenerate. [SEP] [CLS] The next day, advisories were issued on Tropical Disturbance Ex-Hondo, which briefly strengthened into a tropical depression. [SEP] [CLS] However, according to the Joint Typhoon Warning Center, Hondo continued to strengthen and attained winds of 95 km/h (60 mph 1-minute winds) before passing directly over Réunion. [SEP] [CLS] Interaction with the island caused the storm to weaken and degenerate into a remnant low once more. [SEP] [CLS] The storm dissipated on February 29 after executing a counterclockwise loop. [SEP] [CLS]
