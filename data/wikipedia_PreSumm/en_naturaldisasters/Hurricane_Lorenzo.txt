[CLS] Hurricane Lorenzo, also known as Storm Lorenzo for Ireland and the United Kingdom while extratropical, was the easternmost Category 5 Atlantic hurricane on record. [SEP] [CLS] The twelfth named storm, fifth hurricane, third major hurricane and second Category 5 hurricane of the 2019 Atlantic hurricane season, Lorenzo developed from a tropical wave that moved off the west coast of Africa on 22 September, growing larger in size over the course of its development. [SEP] [CLS] On September 26, it rapidly intensified into a Category 4 hurricane before weakening due to an eyewall replacement cycle. [SEP] [CLS] After completing the cycle, Lorenzo rapidly restrengthened, peaking at Category 5 intensity. [SEP] [CLS] Steady weakening followed as the storm moved through unfavorable atmospheric conditions. [SEP] [CLS] Accelerating northeastward, Lorenzo skirted the western Azores on 2 October, and transitioned into an extratropical cyclone. [SEP] [CLS] The extratropical cyclone moved quickly towards Ireland and the United Kingdom and became the first named storm of the 2019â€“20 European windstorm season. [SEP] [CLS] Through late September and early October, large swells were generated by the hurricane's massive wind field, impacting much of the Atlantic basin. [SEP] [CLS] The French ship Bourbon Rhode capsized amid the violent seas on 27 September; among its 14 crew members, three were rescued, four drowned, and the remaining seven are presumed dead. [SEP] [CLS] Four people drowned in rip currents along the coast of North Carolina, and two people were found dead after being swept away by large waves along the coast of New York. [SEP] [CLS] Dangerous sea conditions also spread to Bermuda and as far south as the Caribbean coasts of South America. [SEP] [CLS] On 2 October, Lorenzo passed near the western Azores, briefly bringing strong winds to much of the archipelago. [SEP] [CLS] Flores and Corvo endured the worst of these winds, with a maximum gust of 163 km/h (101 mph) recorded on the latter island. [SEP] [CLS] The extratropical remnants of Lorenzo then affected Ireland and the United Kingdom on October 3 and 4, bringing gusty winds and heavy rains. [SEP] [CLS]
