[SEP] [CLS] apart from using a bit of Pascal and FORTRAN as part of my degree course."Almost immediately after Berners-Lee completed the WorldWideWeb web browser for the NeXT platform, Pellow was tasked with creating a browser, after a quick lesson in C programming. [SEP] [CLS] She wrote the generic Line Mode Browser that could run on non-NeXT systems. [SEP] [CLS] The WWW team began to improve on her work, creating several experimental versions. [SEP] [CLS] Pellow was involved in porting the browser to different types of computers.She left CERN at the end of August 1991 but returned after graduating in 1992 and worked with Robert Cailliau on MacWWW, the first web browser for the classic Mac OS.
