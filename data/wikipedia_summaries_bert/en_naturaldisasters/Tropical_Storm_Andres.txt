The 2015 Pacific hurricane season is the second-most active Pacific hurricane season on record, with 26 named storms, only behind the 1992 season. [CLS] [SEP] A record-tying 16 of those storms became hurricanes, and a record 11 storms further intensified into major hurricanes throughout the season. [CLS] [SEP] The Central Pacific, the portion of the Northeast Pacific Ocean between the International Date Line and the 140th meridian west, had its most active year on record, with 16 tropical cyclones forming in or entering the basin. [CLS] [SEP] Moreover, the season was the third-most active season in terms of accumulated cyclone energy, amassing a total of 287 units. [CLS] [SEP] The season officially started on May 15 in the Eastern Pacific and on June 1 in the Central Pacific; they both ended on November 30. [CLS] [SEP] These dates conventionally delimit the period of each year when most tropical cyclones form in the Northeast Pacific basin. [CLS] [SEP] However, the formation of tropical cyclones is possible at any time of the year. [CLS] [SEP] This was shown when a tropical depression formed on December 31. [CLS] [SEP] The above-average activity during the season was attributed in part to the very strong 2014–16 El Niño event. [CLS] [SEP] The season featured several long-tracking and powerful storms, although land impacts were often minimal. [CLS] [SEP] In June, Hurricane Blanca, an early season Category 4 hurricane, killed four people due to rough seas. [CLS] [SEP] Hurricane Carlos caused minor damage while passing a short distance off the coast of Mexico. [CLS] [SEP] In July, the remnants of Hurricane Dolores brought record rainfall to Southern California, killing one and causing losses worth over $50 million. [CLS] [SEP] On August 29, three Category 4 hurricanes (Kilo, Ignacio, Jimena) were all active simultaneously in the Pacific east of the International Date Line for the first time in recorded history. [CLS] [SEP] In September, moisture from Hurricane Linda contributed to storms that killed 21 people in Utah. [CLS] [SEP] Later that month, Hurricane Marty inflicted $30 million in damage to the southwestern coast of Mexico. [CLS] [SEP] In October, Hurricane Patricia became the most intense hurricane ever recorded in the Western Hemisphere, with a central pressure of 872 mbar (hPa; 25.75 inHg) and 1-minute sustained winds of 215 mph (345 km/h). [CLS] [SEP] After also becoming the strongest landfalling Pacific hurricane on record, Patricia claimed 13 lives and was responsible for $463 million in damage. [CLS] [SEP] The season's activity continued into November when Hurricane Sandra became the strongest Pacific hurricane ever recorded in that month. [CLS] [SEP] Damage across the basin reached $566 million (2015 USD), while 45 people were killed by the various storms. [CLS] [SEP]
