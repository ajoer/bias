Southwest Airlines Flight 1380 was a Boeing 737-7H4 that experienced a failure in the left CFM56-7B engine after departing from New Yorkâ€“LaGuardia Airport en route to Dallas Love Field on April 17, 2018. [CLS] [SEP] The engine cowl was broken in the failure and cowl fragments damaged the fuselage, causing rapid depressurization of the aircraft after damaging a cabin window. [CLS] [SEP] Other fragments caused damage to the wing. [CLS] [SEP] The crew conducted an emergency descent and diverted to Philadelphia International Airport. [CLS] [SEP] One passenger was partially ejected from the aircraft and later died. [CLS] [SEP] Eight other passengers received minor injuries. [CLS] [SEP] The aircraft was substantially damaged.This accident was identical to the accident suffered 20 months earlier by Southwest Airlines Flight 3472 flying the same aircraft type, with the same engine type. [CLS] [SEP] After that accident, the engine manufacturer, CFM, issued a service directive calling for ultrasonic inspections of the turbine fan blades, with certain serial numbers, service cycles, or service time. [CLS] [SEP] Southwest did not do this as this engine was not within the parameters specified by the directive.It was the first fatal airline accident involving a U.S. [CLS] [SEP] passenger carrier since the crash of Colgan Air Flight 3407 in February 2009, and the first aircraft accident involving Southwest Airlines that resulted in the death of a passenger.
