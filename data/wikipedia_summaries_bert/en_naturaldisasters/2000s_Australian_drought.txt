[CLS] The 2000s drought in Australia, also known as the Millennium drought is said by some to be the worst drought recorded since European settlement.This drought affected most of southern Australia, including its largest cities and largest agricultural region (the Murray–Darling basin). [SEP] [CLS] It commenced with low rainfall conditions in late 1996 and through 1997, and worsened through particularly dry years in 2001 and 2002. [SEP] [CLS] By 2003 it was recognised as the worst drought on record.The year 2006 was the driest on record for many parts of the country and conditions remained hot and dry through to early 2010. [SEP] [CLS] The emergence of La Niña weather conditions in 2010 rapidly ended the drought, and led to floods in some locations. [SEP] [CLS] The drought placed extreme pressure on agricultural production and urban water supply in much of southern Australia. [SEP] [CLS] It has led to the construction of six major seawater desalination plants to provide water to Australia's major cities, and to changes in the management of water in the Murray–Darling basin, particularly the formation of the Murray–Darling Basin Authority.
