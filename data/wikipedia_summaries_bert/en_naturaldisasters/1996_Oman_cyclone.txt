The 1996 Oman cyclone (also known as Cyclone 02A) was a tenacious and deadly system that caused historic flooding in the southern Arabian Peninsula. [CLS] [SEP] It originated from a disturbance in the Gulf of Aden, the first such tropical cyclogenesis on record. [CLS] [SEP] After moving eastward, the system interacted with the monsoon trough and became a tropical storm on June 11. [CLS] [SEP] Later that day, it turned toward Oman and struck the country's southeast coast. [CLS] [SEP] It weakened over land, dissipating on June 12, although it continued to produce rainfall – heavy at times – over the next few days. [CLS] [SEP] Offshore Oman, the storm's rough waves disabled an oil tanker and damaged a fishing boat, killing one person in the latter incident. [CLS] [SEP] Striking Oman, the storm produced significant rainfall totals well above the monthly average, peaking at 234 mm (9.2 in) in the Dhofar region. [CLS] [SEP] Strong winds where the storm moved ashore damaged buildings and the local water plant. [CLS] [SEP] The rains washed out roads and isolated villages, killing two people due to drowning in Al-Ghubra. [CLS] [SEP] However, the effects were more severe in Yemen, where the floods were considered the worst on record. [CLS] [SEP] The storm produced the heaviest rainfall in 70 years, reaching 189 mm (7.4 in) in Ma'rib. [CLS] [SEP] Flood waters washed away or damaged 1,068 km (664 mi) of roads and 21 bridges, some of them dating back 2,000 years to the Roman era. [CLS] [SEP] The storm washed away the topsoil or otherwise wrecked 42,800 ha (106,000 acres) of crop fields, accounting for US$100 million in agriculture damage. [CLS] [SEP] At least 1,820 houses were destroyed, many of them built on wadis, or dry river beds. [CLS] [SEP] Overall damage was estimated at US$1.2 billion, and there were 338 deaths in Yemen. [CLS] [SEP] The World Bank assisted in a project to rebuild the damaged infrastructure in Yemen and to mitigate against future floods. [CLS] [SEP]
