[CLS] Hurricane Vince was an unusual hurricane that developed in the northeastern Atlantic basin. [SEP] [CLS] Forming in October during the 2005 Atlantic hurricane season, it strengthened over waters thought to be too cold for tropical development. [SEP] [CLS] Vince was the twentieth named tropical cyclone and twelfth hurricane of the extremely active season. [SEP] [CLS] Vince developed from an extratropical system on 8 October, becoming a subtropical storm southeast of the Azores. [SEP] [CLS] The United States National Hurricane Center (NHC) did not officially name the storm until the next day, shortly before Vince became a hurricane. [SEP] [CLS] The storm weakened at sea and made an extremely rare landfall on the Iberian Peninsula as a tropical depression on 11 October. [SEP] [CLS] Vince was the first tropical system to do so since the 1842 Spanish hurricane. [SEP] [CLS] It dissipated over Spain, bringing much-needed rain to the region, and its remnants passed into the Mediterranean Sea. [SEP] [CLS]
