The 1953 North Kyushu flood was a flood which hit Northern Kyushu, Japan (Fukuoka Prefecture, Saga Prefecture, Kumamoto Prefecture and Ōita Prefecture) in June 1953. [CLS] [SEP] The flood was caused by cloudbursts and prolonged rain from the Meiyu rain front which dropped 1,000 mm (3.3 ft.) of rain over Mount Aso and Mount Hiko. [CLS] [SEP] This downpour resulted in the overflow of many of the surrounding rivers, such as the Chikugo River. [CLS] [SEP] The flood was a major disaster with 1,001 people dead or missing, 450,000 houses flooded, and about 1 million people affected. [CLS] [SEP] Due to the severity of the disaster, flood control measures along rivers in Northern Kyushu were fundamentally revised, with many of the changes still in place. [CLS] [SEP] The flood was not given an official name by the Japan Meteorological Agency which has resulted in it being referred to differently in a variety of sources. [CLS] [SEP] In Kumamoto Prefecture, Shirakawa Great Flood (白川大水害) or 6.26 Flood (6.26水害) are usually used. [CLS] [SEP] In Kitakyushu city, they tend to use North Kyushu Great Flood (北九州大水害).
