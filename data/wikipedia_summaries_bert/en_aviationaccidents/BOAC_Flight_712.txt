BOAC Flight 712 (callsign Speedbird 712) was a British Overseas Airways Corporation (BOAC) service operated by a Boeing 707-465 from London Heathrow Airport bound for Sydney via Zurich and Singapore. [CLS] [SEP] On Monday 8 April 1968, it suffered an engine failure on takeoff that quickly led to a major fire. [CLS] [SEP] The engine fell off the aircraft in flight. [CLS] [SEP] After the aircraft had made a successful emergency landing, confusion over checklists and distractions from the presence of a check pilot contributed to the deaths of five of the 127 on board. [CLS] [SEP] The actions taken by those involved in the accident resulted in the award of the George Cross posthumously to stewardess Barbara Jane Harrison. [CLS] [SEP] Two other crew members received awards; a BEM and an MBE. [CLS] [SEP] As a result of the accident, BOAC changed the checklists for engine severe failures and engine fires, combining them both into one checklist, the "engine fire or severe failure" checklist.
