[CLS] The 2001 India cyclone was the third strongest tropical cyclone, in terms of barometric pressure, to form in the Arabian Sea on record; only Cyclones Gonu in 2007 and Kyarr in 2019 were stronger. [SEP] [CLS] The storm originated from a tropical disturbance that formed east of Somalia on May 18. [SEP] [CLS] Over the following few days, the system gradually organized into a tropical depression. [SEP] [CLS] Tracking eastward, towards the coastline of southwestern India, the storm slowly intensified. [SEP] [CLS] Shortly before reaching shore, the system turned north and later west, away from land. [SEP] [CLS] After taking this turn, the storm intensified into a very severe cyclonic storm, attaining its peak intensity on May 24 with winds of 215 km/h (130 mph 3-minute winds) and a barometric pressure of 932 mbar (hPa). [SEP] [CLS] At the time, this ranked the cyclone as the strongest known storm in the Arabian Sea. [SEP] [CLS] After stalling several hundred kilometres offshore, the storm weakened over cooler waters that it had upwelled. [SEP] [CLS] By May 27, the system weakened to a cyclonic storm and by this time was approaching the northwestern coastline of India, near Gujarat. [SEP] [CLS] The following day, the storm made landfall in the Saurashtra region as a deep depression with winds of 55 km/h (35 mph 3-minute winds). [SEP] [CLS] The depression quickly weakened after moving inland and dissipated early on May 29. [SEP] [CLS] Although a powerful cyclone over water, the storm had relatively little impact over land. [SEP] [CLS] In the Valsad district, two coastal communities lost a combined 200 homes due to large swells produced by the storm. [SEP] [CLS] However, the losses were more extensive offshore. [SEP] [CLS] Between 120 and 900 fishermen were listed as missing after contact was lost with their vessels during the storm. [SEP] [CLS]
