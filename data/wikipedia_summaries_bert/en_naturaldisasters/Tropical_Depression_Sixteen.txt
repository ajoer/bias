The 2007 Atlantic hurricane season was a slightly above-average Atlantic hurricane season, featuring many weak and short-lived storms. [CLS] [SEP] Despite the high activity of weak storms during 2007, it was the first season to feature more than one Category 5 landfalling hurricane, a feat that would not be matched until ten years later. [CLS] [SEP] It produced 17 tropical cyclones, 15 tropical storms, six hurricanes, and two major hurricanes. [CLS] [SEP] It officially started on June 1 and ended on November 30, dates which conventionally delimit the period during which most tropical cyclones form in the Atlantic Ocean, although as shown by Subtropical Storm Andrea and Tropical Storm Olga in early May and early December, respectively, the formation of tropical cyclones is possible at any time of the year. [CLS] [SEP] The first system, Subtropical Storm Andrea, developed on May 9, while the last storm, Tropical Storm Olga, dissipated on December 13. [CLS] [SEP] The most intense hurricane, Dean, is tied for the eighth most intense Atlantic hurricane ever recorded as well as the third most intense Atlantic hurricane at landfall. [CLS] [SEP] The season was one of only seven on record for the Atlantic with more than one Category 5 hurricane. [CLS] [SEP] It was the second on record in which an Atlantic hurricane, Felix, and an eastern Pacific hurricane, Henriette, made landfall on the same day. [CLS] [SEP] September had a record-tying eight storms, although the strengths and durations of most of the storms were low. [CLS] [SEP] Aside from hurricanes Dean and Felix, none of the storms in the season exceeded Category 1 intensity. [CLS] [SEP] Pre-season forecasts by Colorado State University called for 14 named storms and 7 hurricanes, of which three were expected to attain major hurricane status. [CLS] [SEP] The National Oceanic and Atmospheric Administration (NOAA) later issued its initial forecast, which predicted 13 to 17 named storms, 7 to 10 hurricanes and three to five major hurricanes. [CLS] [SEP] After several revisions in the projected number of storms, NOAA and CSU lowered their forecasts by the middle of the season. [CLS] [SEP] Several storms made landfall or directly affected land. [CLS] [SEP] Hurricanes Dean and Felix made landfall at Category 5 intensity, causing severe damage in parts of Mexico and Central America, respectively. [CLS] [SEP] Both storm names, as well as Noel, the name of a hurricane that affected the Caribbean, were retired from the naming list of Atlantic hurricanes. [CLS] [SEP] The United States was affected by five cyclones, although the storms were generally weak; three tropical depressions and only two tropical storms, Barry and Gabrielle, and one hurricane, Humberto, made landfall in the country. [CLS] [SEP] Elsewhere, three storms directly affected Canada, although none severely. [CLS] [SEP] The combined storms killed at least 478 people and caused about $3.42 billion (2007 USD, $4.22 billion 2020 USD) in damage. [CLS] [SEP]
