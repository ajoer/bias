[CLS] In the United States it is rare for third party and independent candidates, other than those of the six parties which have succeeded as major parties (Federalist Party, Democratic-Republican Party, National Republican Party, Democratic Party, Whig Party, Republican Party), to take large shares of the vote in elections. [SEP] [CLS] Listed below are sets of House elections in which a third party or independent candidate won or were reasonably close to receiving 5.0% of the vote (greater than 4.95%). [SEP] [CLS] Winners are shown in bold. [SEP] [CLS] In some of the listed cases a faction or factions of a State major party ran against each other, often making it difficult to ascertain which was the mainline candidate and which was the bolter; in such cases, those candidates which are not listed on a standard major party line are still listed, but are not considered traditional third party victories as often these candidates sat in Congress as affiliated party members (barring cases like Joe Lieberman who, upon winning re-election in 2006 as a third party candidate, sat as an Independent Democrat).
