Severe Tropical Storm Domoina in 1984 caused 100 year floods in South Africa and record rainfall in Swaziland. [CLS] [SEP] The fourth named storm of the season, Domoina developed on January 16 off the northeast coast of Madagascar. [CLS] [SEP] With a ridge to the north, the storm tracked generally westward and later southwestward. [CLS] [SEP] On January 21, Domoina struck eastern Madagascar, the third storm in six weeks to affect the nation; collectively, the storms caused 42 deaths and $25 million in damage (1984 USD). [CLS] [SEP] After crossing the country, Domoina strengthened in the Mozambique Channel to peak 10 minute sustained winds of 95 km/h (60 mph). [CLS] [SEP] On January 28, the storm made landfall in southern Mozambique, and slowly weakened over land. [CLS] [SEP] Domoina crossed into Swaziland and later eastern South Africa before dissipating on February 2. [CLS] [SEP] In Mozambique, Domoina dropped heavy rainfall in the capital Maputo that accounted for 40% of the annual total. [CLS] [SEP] Floods in the country destroyed over 50 small dams and left widespread crop damage just before the summer harvest. [CLS] [SEP] Later, the rains caused the worst flooding in over 20 years in Swaziland, which damaged or destroyed more than 100 bridges. [CLS] [SEP] Disrupted transport left areas isolated for several days. [CLS] [SEP] In South Africa, rainfall peaked at 950 mm (37 in), which flooded 29 river basins, notably the Pongola River which altered its course after the storm. [CLS] [SEP] Flooding caused the Pongolapoort Dam to reach 87% of its capacity; when waters were released to maintain the structural integrity, additional flooding occurred in Mozambique, forcing thousands to evacuate. [CLS] [SEP] Throughout the region, Domoina caused widespread flooding that damaged houses, roads, and crops, leaving about $199 million in damage. [CLS] [SEP] There were 242 deaths in southeastern Africa. [CLS] [SEP]
