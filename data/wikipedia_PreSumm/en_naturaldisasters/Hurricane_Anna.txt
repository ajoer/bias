[CLS] Hurricane Hanna was the first Atlantic hurricane to make landfall in Texas in the month of July since Dolly in 2008. [SEP] [CLS] The eighth named storm and first hurricane of the 2020 Atlantic hurricane season, Hanna developed from a tropical wave originating near Hispaniola. [SEP] [CLS] This disturbance dropped heavy rain over parts of Hispaniola, Cuba, and Florida. [SEP] [CLS] The wave gradually became more organized and developed into a tropical depression in the central portion of the Gulf of Mexico. [SEP] [CLS] The depression strengthened into a tropical storm on July 24, setting a new record for earliest eighth-named storm in the basin, getting its name 10 calendar days before the previous record holder, Tropical Storm Harvey of 2005. [SEP] [CLS] Hanna steadily intensified as it drifted toward Southern Texas, becoming the season's first hurricane early on July 25 before quickly strengthening and making landfall later in the day. [SEP] [CLS] Hanna made landfall at 22:00 UTC later that day as a high-end Category 1 hurricane, with maximum sustained winds of 90 mph (150 km/h) and a minimum central pressure of 973 mbar (hPa; 28.73 inHg). [SEP] [CLS] Along the way it dumped up to 18 inches of rain in isolated areas in Southern Texas and Mexico. [SEP] [CLS] The storm resulted in 50,000+ people losing power. [SEP] [CLS] Hurricane Hanna caused minor damage to well built structures, serious damage to smaller structures, and downed powerlines. [SEP] [CLS] Hanna weakened quickly as it moved inland and turned west-southwest, eventually dissipating over Mexico on July 27. [SEP] [CLS] Hanna was the first hurricane to make landfall in Texas since Hurricane Harvey in 2017. [SEP] [CLS] In Florida, Hanna killed one person due to rip currents. [SEP] [CLS] Hanna's outer bands also caused rounds of thunderstorms across parts of the Northern Gulf Coast. [SEP] [CLS] In Texas, where the storm made landfall, extensive property damage was reported in the Rio Grande Valley especially in Port Mansfield. [SEP] [CLS] The brunt of the damage was located south of the city of Corpus Christi due to the eye taking a more southward path than originally forecast. [SEP] [CLS] Corpus Christi experienced storm surge flooding and tropical storm-force winds, while areas to the south of the city experienced hurricane-force sustained winds. [SEP] [CLS] In Mexico, severe flooding caused by Hanna killed three people. [SEP] [CLS]
