Typhoon Jebi, known in the Philippines as Typhoon Maymay, was an extremely damaging tropical cyclone that became the strongest typhoon to strike Japan since Yancy in 1993 as well as Japan's costliest typhoon on. [CLS] [SEP] Jebi formed from a tropical depression south-southwest of Wake Island on August 26, before becoming the twenty-first named storm of the 2018 Pacific typhoon season on August 27. [CLS] [SEP] Amid favorable environmental conditions, Jebi quickly strengthened into a typhoon on August 29 as it headed west, then rapidly intensified as it passed the Northern Mariana Islands on August 30. [CLS] [SEP] Subsequently, Jebi reached peak intensity as a powerful typhoon on August 31, with 10-minute sustained winds of 195 km/h (120 mph), 1-minute sustained winds of 285 km/h (180 mph), and a minimum pressure of 915 hPa (mbar; 27.02 inHg). [CLS] [SEP] Afterwards, Jebi began a slow weakening trend as it turned northwest, briefly passing through the Philippine Area of Responsibility on September 2. [CLS] [SEP] Jebi accelerated north-northeast on September 3 as it interacted with the westerlies, before making landfalls over Shikoku and then the Kansai region of Japan early on September 4. [CLS] [SEP] Jebi quickly weakened over land and became an extratropical cyclone later that day over the Sea of Japan. [CLS] [SEP] The remnants of Jebi moved over the Russian Far East before dissipating on September 7. [CLS] [SEP] Jebi passed north of the Northern Mariana Islands as an intensifying typhoon on August 31, bringing minor flooding. [CLS] [SEP] Heavy swells produced by Jebi caused large waves along the coast of Taiwan that caused at least six fatalities from September 2–3. [CLS] [SEP] In Japan, significant impacts occurred across the Kansai region. [CLS] [SEP] The typhoon's powerful winds, which broke wind records at 100 Japanese weather stations, damaged nearly 98,000 houses and left nearly 3 million customers without electricity after blowing down power lines. [CLS] [SEP] Heavy rains combined with the winds to damage buildings and infrastructure, including several shrines and historical buildings. [CLS] [SEP] Agricultural damage from the adverse weather conditions were also significant, with losses from the agricultural, forestry, and fishing industries valued at almost JP¥47 billion (US$430 million). [CLS] [SEP] Fruits were blown off trees, crops were lodged, and power outages affected storage of livestock and produce. [CLS] [SEP] Storm surge flooded over 700 houses and inundated part of Kansai International Airport, which combined with wind and rain damage to the terminals forced the airport to close from September 4–13. [CLS] [SEP] The typhoon also cut off access to the airport by blowing a tanker into the bridge connecting the airport to the mainland; repairs to the bridge only completed seven months later. [CLS] [SEP] In total, 14 people were killed in Japan, mostly from falls and flying debris, and 980 were injured. [CLS] [SEP] Insured losses reached JP¥1.6 trillion (US$13–14 billion). [CLS] [SEP]
