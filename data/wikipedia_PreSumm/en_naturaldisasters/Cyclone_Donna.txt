[CLS] Severe Tropical Cyclone Donna was the strongest off-season tropical cyclone in the Southern Hemisphere during the month of May. [SEP] [CLS] The twenty-first tropical disturbance, third named storm, and second severe tropical cyclone of the annual cyclone season, Donna formed from an area of disturbed weather that was first monitored west-northwest of Fiji on 1 May 2017. [SEP] [CLS] The disturbance drifted eastward amid an increasingly favourable environment, and it was designated Tropical Depression 21F late on 2 May. [SEP] [CLS] Twelve hours later, it intensified into a Category 1 on the Australian tropical cyclone scale and was designated Tropical Cyclone Donna as the storm's motion shifted west and then south. [SEP] [CLS] After reaching its initial peak as a Category 4 cyclone early on 6 May, the effects of wind shear and upwelling caused the storm to weaken. [SEP] [CLS] However, it reintensified into a Category 5 cyclone on 8 May. [SEP] [CLS] Soon after, Donna entered a region of strong westerly flow and began to rapidly weaken. [SEP] [CLS] Continuing to accelerate in a southerly direction, Donna eventually weakened into a tropical low on 10 May. [SEP] [CLS] By 16 May, Donna's remnants had fully dissipated. [SEP] [CLS] Buffeting the island chain of Vanuatu, Donna has resulted in severe damage throughout the northern provinces, though the exact extent is unknown in the absence of good communication.
