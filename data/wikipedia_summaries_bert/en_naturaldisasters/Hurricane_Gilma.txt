[CLS] Hurricane Gilma was one of the most intense Pacific hurricanes on record and the second of three Category 5 hurricanes during the active 1994 Pacific hurricane season. [SEP] [CLS] Developing from a westward tracking tropical wave over the open waters of the eastern Pacific Ocean on July 21, the pre-Gilma tropical depression was initially large and disorganized. [SEP] [CLS] Gradual development took place over the following day before rapid intensification began. [SEP] [CLS] By July 23, the storm intensified into a hurricane and later a Category 5 storm on July 24. [SEP] [CLS] As Gilma reached this intensity, it crossed into the Central Pacific basin, the fourth consecutive storm to do so. [SEP] [CLS] The storm peaked early on July 24 with winds of 160 mph (260 km/h) and a barometric pressure estimated at 920 mbar (hPa; 27.17 inHg). [SEP] [CLS] The following day, unknown factors caused the storm to suddenly weaken before increasing wind shear took over. [SEP] [CLS] The storm gradually weakened for the duration of its existence, turning slowly to the northwest. [SEP] [CLS] Late on July 28, the storm brushed Johnston Atoll, bringing gusty winds and light rainfall to the region. [SEP] [CLS] Gilma persisted until July 31 at which time it was downgraded to a tropical depression and dissipated over open waters. [SEP] [CLS]
