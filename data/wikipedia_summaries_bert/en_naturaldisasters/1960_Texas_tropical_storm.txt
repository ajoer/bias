[CLS] The 1960 Texas tropical storm brought severe but localized flooding to southeastern Texas in June 1960. [SEP] [CLS] The first tropical cyclone and first tropical storm of the 1960 Atlantic hurricane season, this system developed from an area of showers and thunderstorms in the Bay of Campeche on June 22. [SEP] [CLS] Initially a tropical depression, it strengthened and was estimated to have reached tropical storm status on June 23. [SEP] [CLS] Early on the following day, the storm peaked with winds of 60 mph (95 km/h). [SEP] [CLS] Later that day, it made landfall near Corpus Christi, Texas, at the same intensity. [SEP] [CLS] The storm weakened slowly and moved across the Central United States, before dissipating over Illinois on June 28. [SEP] [CLS] In Texas, the storm dropped up to 29.76 inches (756 mm) of precipitation in Port Lavaca. [SEP] [CLS] Thus considerable flooding occurred in some areas of south and eastern Texas. [SEP] [CLS] Throughout the state, more than 150 houses sustained flood damage in several counties. [SEP] [CLS] In addition, numerous major highways were closed, including portions of U.S. [SEP] [CLS] Routes 59, 87, 90, and then-185, and Texas State Highways 35 and 71. [SEP] [CLS] In Arkansas, a few buildings in Hot Springs were damaged from high winds. [SEP] [CLS] Flooding in that state resulted in three deaths from drowning. [SEP] [CLS] Light to moderate rainfall was recorded in at least 11 other states, though damage was minimal. [SEP] [CLS] The storm was the rainiest tropical cyclone on record in the state of Kentucky, dropping 11.25 inches (286 mm) in Dunmor.
