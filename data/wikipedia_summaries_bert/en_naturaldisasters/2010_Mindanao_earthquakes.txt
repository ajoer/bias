The 2010 Mindanao earthquakes occurred in the southern Philippines in the Moro Gulf. [CLS] [SEP] This was a complex sequence of events including three man events (a triplet earthquake) of Mw magnitude 7.3 or greater on the 23rd of July, and two significant aftershocks of magnitude 6.6 on the 24th and 29th. [CLS] [SEP] All of these were deep focus earthquakes, at depths from 565 km (351 mi) to 634 km (394 mi). [CLS] [SEP] This resulted in minimal, but very widespread shaking at the surface, with a maximum intensity of IV (Moderately strong) on the PEIS scale; consequently there were no reports of casualties or damage.
