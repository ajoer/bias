Severe Tropical Cyclone Lua affected a sparsely populated region of Western Australia during mid-March 2012. [CLS] [SEP] Originating in a broad low pressure area that formed northwest of Australia by 8 March, the storm was plagued by inhibiting wind shear for the duration of its formative stages. [CLS] [SEP] However, it gradually organised, and received the name Lua on 13 March. [CLS] [SEP] The cyclone meandered for the first several days of its existence, caught between weak and competing steering currents. [CLS] [SEP] After the cyclone drifted northwestward, a building ridge of high pressure to the north drove Lua southeastward toward the Pilbara region. [CLS] [SEP] Ultimately intensifying into an upper-end Category 3 severe tropical cyclone with maximum sustained 10-minute winds of 155 km/h (100 mph), Lua made landfall near the remote community of Pardoo, about 150 km (95 mi) east of Port Hedland. [CLS] [SEP] It steadily weakened as it progressed south over interior Western Australia, diminishing below tropical cyclone status on 18 March. [CLS] [SEP] The threat of the impending cyclone halted local industries such as oil production and iron ore mining and exporting. [CLS] [SEP] The Port of Port Hedland, a highly important iron ore shipping terminal, was forced to close for about 52 hours, contributing to inflated iron ore prices and delayed shipments. [CLS] [SEP] Multiple companies suspended work at oil fields and mines throughout the region, cutting national oil production by 25% and iron ore exports by 4.7% versus the previous month. [CLS] [SEP] Overall, Lua is attributed to $217 million (2012 AUD; $230 million 2012 USD) in lost revenue. [CLS] [SEP] Lua produced strong winds and widespread rainfall on land, but damage was limited by the lack of population in the storm's path. [CLS] [SEP] The Pardoo Roadhouse bore the brunt of the storm, and damage was reported at several other cattle stations and homesteads; at these sites, the storm damaged the exteriors of various structures and brought down swaths of trees. [CLS] [SEP] Central Western Australia endured several days of record-breaking rainfall and cool weather. [CLS] [SEP] The Government of Western Australia provided disaster relief funds to the hardest-hit areas, and Lua was later retired from the list of tropical cyclone names. [CLS] [SEP]
