The 2014 Pacific hurricane season was the fifth-busiest season since reliable records began in 1949, alongside the 2016 season. [CLS] [SEP] The season officially started on May 15 in the East Pacific Ocean, and on June 1 in the Central Pacific; they both ended on November 30. [CLS] [SEP] These dates conventionally delimit the period of each year when most tropical cyclones form in the Pacific basin. [CLS] [SEP] Entering the season, expectations of tropical activity were high, with most weather agencies predicting a near or above average season. [CLS] [SEP] The season began with an active start, with three tropical cyclones developing before June 15, including two Category 4 hurricanes, of which one became the strongest tropical cyclone ever recorded in May in the East Pacific. [CLS] [SEP] After a less active period in late June and early July, activity once again picked up in late July. [CLS] [SEP] Activity increased in August, which featured four major hurricanes, and persisted throughout September and October. [CLS] [SEP] However, activity finally waned by early November. [CLS] [SEP] Overall, the 22 tropical storms marked the highest total in 22 years. [CLS] [SEP] In addition, a record-tying 16 hurricanes developed. [CLS] [SEP] Furthermore, there were total of nine major hurricanes, Category 3 or greater on the Saffir-Simpson Hurricane Wind Scale, including a then-record-tying eight in Eastern Pacific proper (east of 140Â°W). [CLS] [SEP] The active season resulted in numerous records and highlights. [CLS] [SEP] First, Hurricane Amanda was the strongest May hurricane and earliest Category 4 on record. [CLS] [SEP] A month later, Hurricane Cristina became the earliest second major hurricane, although it was surpassed by Hurricane Blanca the following year. [CLS] [SEP] In August, Hurricane Iselle became the strongest tropical cyclone on record to strike the Big Island of Hawaii while Hurricane Marie was the first Category 5 hurricane since 2010. [CLS] [SEP] The following month, Hurricane Odile became the most destructive tropical cyclone of the season and the most intense and destructive tropical cyclone to make landfall over the Baja California peninsula.
