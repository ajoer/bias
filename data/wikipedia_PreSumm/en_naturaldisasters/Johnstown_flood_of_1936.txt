[CLS] The Johnstown flood of 1936, also collectively with other areas referred to as the Saint Patrick's Day Flood, was a devastating flood in Cambria County, and Johnstown, Pennsylvania proper, referred to as "Greater Johnstown". [SEP] [CLS] The flood was preceded by heavy rains beginning March 9, 1936, which did not stop until March 22. [SEP] [CLS] The storms brought warmer weather with temperatures of 50 °F (10 °C) and was a cause of one stage of the flooding; the continuous rainfall was the second cause. [SEP] [CLS] The natural surface runoff of 1 to 3 inches (2.5 to 7.5 cm) was far surpassed by the deluge of from 10 to 30 inches (25 to 75 cm) of water in the region. [SEP] [CLS] The flood came before pending flood control legislation was enacted or any significant flood control measures were implemented. [SEP] [CLS] The narrowness of the valleys and the encroachment of buildings on riverbanks contributed to the record flooding. [SEP] [CLS] By the time nightfall on March 17, one-third of the city was under 17 feet (5.2 m) of water. [SEP] [CLS] Twenty-five people lost their lives in the disaster, and damages estimated at $43 million made it the worst flood since the flood of 1889. [SEP] [CLS] The event is chronicled at the Johnstown Flood Museum.After the flood, sweeping nationwide flood control laws were enacted and from 1938 to 1943 Johnstown saw many projects completed. [SEP] [CLS] These measures gave residents the feeling that the area was now "flood free", and it was touted as such until the flood of 1977. [SEP] [CLS]
