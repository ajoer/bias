[CLS] Mahavira, also known as Vardhamana was the 24th tirthankara of Jainism. [SEP] [CLS] He was the spiritual successor of 23rd tirthankara Parshvanatha. [SEP] [CLS] Mahavira was born in the early part of the 6th century BC into a royal Kshatriya Jain family in present-day Bihar, India. [SEP] [CLS] His mother's name was Trishala and father's name was Siddhartha. [SEP] [CLS] They were lay devotees of Parshvanatha. [SEP] [CLS] Mahavira abandoned all worldly possessions at the age of about 30 and left home in pursuit of spiritual awakening, becoming an ascetic. [SEP] [CLS] Mahavira practiced intense meditation and severe austerities for 12 and half years, after which he attained Kevala Jnana (omniscience). [SEP] [CLS] He preached for 30 years and attained moksha (salvation) in the 6th century BC, although the year varies by sect. [SEP] [CLS] Historically, Mahavira, who preached Jainism in ancient India, was an older contemporary of Gautama Buddha. [SEP] [CLS] Scholars variously date him from 6th-5th century BC and his place of birth is also a point of dispute among them. [SEP] [CLS] Mahavira taught that observance of the vows of ahimsa (non-violence), satya (truth), asteya (non-stealing), brahmacharya (chastity), and aparigraha (non-attachment) are necessary for spiritual liberation. [SEP] [CLS] He taught the principles of Anekantavada (many-sided reality): syadvada and nayavada. [SEP] [CLS] Mahavira's teachings were compiled by Indrabhuti Gautama (his chief disciple) as the Jain Agamas. [SEP] [CLS] The texts, transmitted orally by Jain monks, are believed to have been largely lost by about the 1st century CE (when the remaining were first written down in the Svetambara tradition). [SEP] [CLS] The surviving versions of the Agamas taught by Mahavira are some of Svetambara Jainism's foundation texts, but their authenticity is disputed in Digambara Jainism. [SEP] [CLS] Mahavira is usually depicted in a sitting or standing meditative posture, with the symbol of a lion beneath him. [SEP] [CLS] His earliest iconography is from archaeological sites in the North Indian city of Mathura, and is dated from the 1st century BCE to the 2nd century AD. [SEP] [CLS] His birth is celebrated as Mahavir Janma Kalyanak and his nirvana (salvation) is observed by Jains as Diwali. [SEP] [CLS]
