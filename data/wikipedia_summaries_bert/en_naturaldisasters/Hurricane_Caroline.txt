[CLS] Hurricane Caroline was one of two tropical cyclones to affect northern Mexico during the 1975 Atlantic hurricane season. [SEP] [CLS] The third named storm and second hurricane of the season, Caroline developed on August 24 north of the Dominican Republic. [SEP] [CLS] The system crossed Cuba and briefly degenerated into a tropical wave due to land interaction. [SEP] [CLS] However, upon emergence into the western Caribbean Sea, it was once again designated as a tropical depression after a well-defined circulation was observed on satellite imagery. [SEP] [CLS] Moving towards the west-northwest, the cyclone clipped the northern portion of the Yucat√°n Peninsula before entering the Gulf of Mexico. [SEP] [CLS] Caroline was upgraded to a tropical storm on August 29 in the central Gulf of Mexico before rapid intensification began. [SEP] [CLS] Early on August 31, Caroline reached its peak intensity with winds of 115 mph (185 km/h), before landfall south of Brownsville, Texas with winds of 105 mph (165 km/h) shortly thereafter. [SEP] [CLS] After moving inland, Caroline quickly weakened and dissipated over the mountainous terrain of northeastern Mexico on September 1. [SEP] [CLS] There were only two deaths from Caroline, both indirect. [SEP] [CLS] However, there was heavy rainfall in southern Texas and Mexico, including almost 12 in (300 mm) at Port Isabel.
