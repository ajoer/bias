Severus Alexander (Marcus Aurelius Severus Alexander; c. [CLS] [SEP] 208 – 19 March 235) was Roman emperor from 222 to 235, and the last from the Severan dynasty. [CLS] [SEP] Alexander was the heir to his cousin, the 18-year-old Emperor Elagabalus, who had been murdered along with his mother Julia Soaemias, by his own guards, who, as a mark of contempt, had their remains cast into the Tiber river. [CLS] [SEP] He and his cousin were both grandsons of the very influential and powerful woman Julia Maesa, who had arranged for Elagabalus' acclamation as emperor by the famous Third Gallic Legion. [CLS] [SEP] It was the rumor of Alexander's death that triggered the assassination of Elagabalus and his mother.Alexander's 13-year reign was the longest reign of a sole emperor since Antoninus Pius. [CLS] [SEP] He was also the second-youngest ever sole legal Roman Emperor during the existence of the united empire, the youngest being Gordian III. [CLS] [SEP] Alexander's peacetime reign was prosperous. [CLS] [SEP] However, Rome was militarily confronted with the rising Sassanid Empire and growing incursions from the tribes of Germania. [CLS] [SEP] He managed to check the threat of the Sassanids. [CLS] [SEP] But when campaigning against Germanic tribes, Alexander attempted to bring peace by engaging in diplomacy and bribery. [CLS] [SEP] This alienated many in the Roman Army, leading to a conspiracy that resulted in the assassination of Alexander and his mother Julia Avita Mamaea and the accession of Maximinus Thrax. [CLS] [SEP] Alexander's death marked the epoch event for the Crisis of the Third Century—nearly 50 years of civil wars, foreign invasion, and collapse of the monetary economy. [CLS] [SEP]
