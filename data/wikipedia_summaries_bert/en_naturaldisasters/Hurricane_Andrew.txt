Hurricane Andrew was a powerful and destructive Category 5 Atlantic hurricane that struck the Bahamas, Florida, and Louisiana in August 1992. [CLS] [SEP] It is the most destructive hurricane to ever hit Florida in terms of structures damaged or destroyed, and was the costliest in financial terms until Hurricane Irma surpassed it 25 years later. [CLS] [SEP] It was the strongest landfalling hurricane in decades and the costliest hurricane to make landfall anywhere in the United States, until it was surpassed by Katrina in 2005. [CLS] [SEP] In addition, Andrew is one of only four Category 5 hurricanes to make landfall in the United States, alongside the 1935 Labor Day hurricane, Hurricane Camille in 1969, and Hurricane Michael in 2018. [CLS] [SEP] Andrew caused major damage in the Bahamas and Louisiana, but the greatest impact was felt in South Florida, where the storm made landfall as a Category 5 hurricane, with 1-minute sustained wind speeds as high as 165 mph (266 km/h). [CLS] [SEP] Passing directly through the city of Homestead in Dade County (now known as Miami-Dade County), Andrew stripped many homes of all but their concrete foundations. [CLS] [SEP] In total, Andrew destroyed more than 63,500 houses, damaged more than 124,000 others, caused $27.3 billion in damage, and left 65 people dead. [CLS] [SEP] Andrew began as a tropical depression over the eastern Atlantic Ocean on August 16. [CLS] [SEP] After spending a week without significantly strengthening itself in the central Atlantic, it rapidly intensified into a powerful Category 5 hurricane while moving westward towards the Bahamas on August 23. [CLS] [SEP] Though it briefly weakened to Category 4 status while traversing the Bahamas, it regained Category 5 intensity before making landfall in Florida on Elliott Key and then Homestead on August 24. [CLS] [SEP] With a barometric pressure of 922 mbar (27.23 inHg) at the time of landfall in Florida, Andrew is the sixth most-intense hurricane to strike the United States. [CLS] [SEP] Several hours later, the hurricane emerged over the Gulf of Mexico at Category 4 strength, with the Gulf Coast of the United States in its dangerous path. [CLS] [SEP] After turning northwestward and weakening further, Andrew moved ashore near Morgan City, Louisiana, as a low-end Category 3 storm. [CLS] [SEP] After moving inland, the small hurricane curved northeastward and rapidly lost its intensity, merging with a frontal system over the southern Appalachian Mountains on August 29. [CLS] [SEP] Andrew first inflicted structural damage as it moved through the Bahamas, especially in Cat Cays, lashing the islands with storm surge, hurricane-force winds, and tornadoes. [CLS] [SEP] About 800 houses were destroyed in the archipelago, and there was substantial damage to the transport, water, sanitation, agriculture, and fishing sectors. [CLS] [SEP] Andrew left four dead and $250 million in damage throughout the Bahamas. [CLS] [SEP] In parts of southern Florida, Andrew produced severe winds; a wind gust of 177 mph (282 km/h) was observed at a house in Perrine. [CLS] [SEP] The cities of Florida City, Homestead, Cutler Ridge and parts of Kendall received the brunt of the storm. [CLS] [SEP] As many as 1.4 million people lost power at the height of the storm; some for more than one month. [CLS] [SEP] In the Everglades, 70,000 acres (280 km2) of trees were downed, while invasive Burmese pythons began inhabiting the region after a nearby facility housing them was destroyed. [CLS] [SEP] Rainfall in Florida was substantial, peaking at 13.98 inches (355 mm) in western Dade County. [CLS] [SEP] In Florida, Andrew killed 44 and left a record $25 billion in damage. [CLS] [SEP] Prior to making landfall in Louisiana on August 26, Andrew caused extensive damage to oil platforms in the Gulf of Mexico, leading to $500 million in losses for oil companies. [CLS] [SEP] It produced hurricane-force winds along its path through Louisiana, damaging large stretches of power lines that left about 230,000 people without electricity. [CLS] [SEP] Over 80% of trees in the Atchafalaya River basin were downed, and the agriculture there was devastated. [CLS] [SEP] Throughout the basin and Bayou Lafourche, 187 million freshwater fish were killed in the hurricane. [CLS] [SEP] With 23,000 houses damaged, 985 others destroyed, and 1,951 mobile homes demolished, property losses in Louisiana exceeded $1.5 billion. [CLS] [SEP] The hurricane caused the deaths of 17 people in the state, 6 of whom drowned offshore. [CLS] [SEP] Andrew spawned at least 28 tornadoes along the Gulf Coast, especially in Alabama, Georgia, and Mississippi. [CLS] [SEP] In total, Andrew left 65 dead and caused $27.3 billion in damage. [CLS] [SEP] It is currently the seventh-costliest Atlantic hurricane to hit the United States, behind only Katrina (2005), Ike (2008), Sandy (2012), Harvey (2017), Irma (2017), and Maria (2017), as well as the eighth-costliest Atlantic hurricane, behind the aforementioned systems and Wilma (2005). [CLS] [SEP] It is the third-strongest hurricane to hit the U.S. [CLS] [SEP] mainland by wind speed (165 mph). [CLS] [SEP]
