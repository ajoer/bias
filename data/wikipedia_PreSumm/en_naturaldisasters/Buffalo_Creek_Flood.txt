[CLS] The Buffalo Creek flood was a disaster that occurred on February 26, 1972, when the Pittston Coal Company's coal slurry impoundment dam #3, located on a hillside in Logan County, West Virginia, burst, four days after having been declared "satisfactory" by a federal mine inspector.The resulting flood unleashed approximately 132 million US gallons (500,000 cubic metres; 500 million litres) of black waste water, cresting over 30 feet (9.1 m) high, upon the residents of sixteen coal towns along Buffalo Creek Hollow. [SEP] [CLS] Out of a population of 5,000 people, 125 were killed, 1,121 were injured, and over 4,000 were left homeless. [SEP] [CLS] 507 houses were destroyed, in addition to 44 mobile homes and 30 businesses. [SEP] [CLS] The disaster destroyed or damaged homes in Saunders, Pardee, Lorado, Craneco, Lundale, Stowe, Crites, Latrobe, Robinette, Amherstdale, Becco, Fanco, Braeholm, Accoville, Crown and Kistler. [SEP] [CLS] In its legal filings, Pittston Coal referred to the accident as "an Act of God." Dam #3, constructed of coarse mining refuse dumped into the Middle Fork of Buffalo Creek starting in 1968, failed first, following heavy rains. [SEP] [CLS] The water from dam #3 then overwhelmed dams #2 and #1. [SEP] [CLS] Dam #3 had been built on top of coal slurry sediment that had collected behind dams # 1 and #2, instead of on solid bedrock. [SEP] [CLS] Dam #3 was approximately 260 feet (79 m) above the town of Saunders when it failed. [SEP] [CLS]
