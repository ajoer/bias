Jupiter is the fifth planet from the Sun and the largest in the Solar System. [CLS] [SEP] It is a gas giant with a mass one-thousandth that of the Sun, but two-and-a-half times that of all the other planets in the Solar System combined. [CLS] [SEP] Jupiter is one of the brightest objects visible to the naked eye in the night sky, and has been known to ancient civilizations since before recorded history. [CLS] [SEP] It is named after the Roman god Jupiter. [CLS] [SEP] When viewed from Earth, Jupiter can be bright enough for its reflected light to cast visible shadows, and is on average the third-brightest natural object in the night sky after the Moon and Venus. [CLS] [SEP] Jupiter is primarily composed of hydrogen with a quarter of its mass being helium, though helium comprises only about a tenth of the number of molecules. [CLS] [SEP] It may also have a rocky core of heavier elements, but like the other giant planets, Jupiter lacks a well-defined solid surface. [CLS] [SEP] Because of its rapid rotation, the planet's shape is that of an oblate spheroid (it has a slight but noticeable bulge around the equator). [CLS] [SEP] The outer atmosphere is visibly segregated into several bands at different latitudes, resulting in turbulence and storms along their interacting boundaries. [CLS] [SEP] A prominent result is the Great Red Spot, a giant storm that is known to have existed since at least the 17th century when it was first seen by telescope. [CLS] [SEP] Surrounding Jupiter is a faint planetary ring system and a powerful magnetosphere. [CLS] [SEP] Jupiter has 79 known moons, including the four large Galilean moons discovered by Galileo Galilei in 1610. [CLS] [SEP] Ganymede, the largest of these, has a diameter greater than that of the planet Mercury. [CLS] [SEP] Pioneer 10 was the first spacecraft to visit Jupiter, making its closest approach to the planet on December 4, 1973; Pioneer 10 identified plasma in Jupiter's magnetic field and also found that Jupiter's magnetic tail was nearly 800 million kilometers long, covering the entire distance to Saturn. [CLS] [SEP] Jupiter has been explored on a number of occasions by robotic spacecraft, beginning with the Pioneer and Voyager flyby missions from 1973 to 1979, and later by the Galileo orbiter, which arrived at Jupiter in 1995. [CLS] [SEP] In late February 2007, Jupiter was visited by the New Horizons probe, which used Jupiter's gravity to increase its speed and bend its trajectory en route to Pluto. [CLS] [SEP] The latest probe to visit the planet is Juno, which entered into orbit around Jupiter on July 4, 2016. [CLS] [SEP] Future targets for exploration in the Jupiter system include the probable ice-covered liquid ocean of its moon Europa. [CLS] [SEP]
