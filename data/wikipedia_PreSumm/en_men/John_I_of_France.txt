[SEP] [CLS] His reign is the shortest of any French king. [SEP] [CLS] Although considered a king today, his status was not recognized until chroniclers and historians in later centuries began numbering John II, thereby acknowledging John I's brief reign.John reigned for five days under the regency of his uncle, Philip the Tall of France, until his death on 20 November 1316. [SEP] [CLS] His death ended the three centuries of father-to-son succession to the French throne. [SEP] [CLS] The infant king was buried in the Basilica of Saint-Denis.
