[CLS] Racer's hurricane was a destructive tropical cyclone that had severe effects in northeastern Mexico, the Republic of Texas, and the Gulf Coast of the United States in early October 1837. [SEP] [CLS] It takes its name from the Royal Navy ship HMS Racer, which encountered the cyclone in the northwestern Caribbean Sea. [SEP] [CLS] Termed "one of the most famous and destructive hurricanes of the century" by meteorology historian David Ludlum, the storm first affected Jamaica with flooding rainfall and strong winds on September 26 and 27, before entering the Gulf of Mexico by October 1. [SEP] [CLS] As the hurricane struck northern Tamaulipas and southern Texas, it slowed to a crawl and turned sharply northeastward. [SEP] [CLS] The storm battered the Gulf Coast from Texas to the Florida Panhandle between October 3 and 7. [SEP] [CLS] After crossing the Southeastern United States, it emerged into the Atlantic shipping lanes off the Carolinas by October 9. [SEP] [CLS] The effects of the tropical cyclone were far-reaching. [SEP] [CLS] Matamoros, on the southern bank of the Rio Grande, faced hurricane conditions for several days, with significant damage to ships. [SEP] [CLS] Many towns along the Texas shoreline were inundated by storm surge, which flooded the coastal plains for many miles inland. [SEP] [CLS] Galveston Island was devastated, with nearly every building washed away and most vessels driven ashore. [SEP] [CLS] To the east, a water level rise of 8 ft (2.4 m) on Lake Pontchartrain submerged low-lying areas of New Orleans. [SEP] [CLS] Many steamboats on the lake were wrecked and buildings along its shores demolished. [SEP] [CLS] Storm surge and wind damage extended into Mississippi and Alabama, but with less severity. [SEP] [CLS] In the interior Southeast, sugar cane and cotton crops bore heavy losses. [SEP] [CLS] As the weakening storm buffeted the Outer Banks of North Carolina on October 9, the passenger steamship SS Home ran aground about 300 ft (91 m) off Cape Hatteras and rapidly broke up in the pounding surf. [SEP] [CLS] About 90 passengers and crewmen died in the wreck. [SEP] [CLS] Overall, Racer's hurricane killed an estimated 105 people. [SEP] [CLS]
