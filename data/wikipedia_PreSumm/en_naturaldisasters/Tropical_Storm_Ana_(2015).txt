[CLS] Tropical Storm Ana was the earliest recorded tropical cyclone to make landfall in the United States in any given year. [SEP] [CLS] A relatively rare pre-season system, Ana was the first tropical storm of the 2015 Atlantic hurricane season. [SEP] [CLS] It developed as a subtropical cyclone from a non-tropical low north of the Bahamas, and intensified to attain peak winds of 60 mph (97 km/h) before transitioning into a fully tropical cyclone early on May 9. [SEP] [CLS] Sustained in part by the warm waters of the Gulf Stream, Ana made landfall along the northeast coast of South Carolina early the next morning, becoming the earliest U.S. [SEP] [CLS] landfalling system on record. [SEP] [CLS] Overall, damage from the storm was minor. [SEP] [CLS] Heavy rainfall and gusty winds affected parts of the Carolinas, and some vulnerable beaches endured coastal flooding and several feet of erosion. [SEP] [CLS] Gusty winds damaged trees and powerlines, causing sporadic power outages, and a weak tornado was reported in association with Ana. [SEP] [CLS] In North Carolina, two deaths—one direct and one indirect—were attributed to the storm. [SEP] [CLS]
