[CLS] Hurricane Hazel was the deadliest, costliest, and most intense hurricane of the 1954 Atlantic hurricane season. [SEP] [CLS] The storm killed at least 469 people in Haiti before striking the United States near the border between North and South Carolina as a Category 4 hurricane. [SEP] [CLS] After causing 95 fatalities in the US, Hazel struck Canada as an extratropical storm, raising the death toll by 81 people, mostly in Toronto. [SEP] [CLS] As a result of the high death toll and the damage caused by Hazel, its name was retired from use for North Atlantic hurricanes. [SEP] [CLS] In Haiti, Hazel destroyed 40 percent of the coffee trees and 50 percent of the cacao crop, affecting the economy for several years. [SEP] [CLS] The hurricane made landfall near Calabash, North Carolina, destroying most waterfront dwellings. [SEP] [CLS] It then traveled north along the Atlantic coast. [SEP] [CLS] Hazel affected Virginia, Washington, D.C., West Virginia, Maryland, Delaware, New Jersey, Pennsylvania, and New York; it brought gusts near 160 km/h (100 mph) and caused $281 million (1954 USD) in damage. [SEP] [CLS] When it was over Pennsylvania, Hazel consolidated with a cold front and turned northwest towards Canada. [SEP] [CLS] When it hit Ontario as an extratropical storm, rivers and streams in and around Toronto overflowed their banks, which caused severe flooding. [SEP] [CLS] As a result, many residential areas in the local floodplains, such as the Raymore Drive area, were subsequently converted to parkland. [SEP] [CLS] In Canada alone, over C$135 million (2018: C$1.3 billion) of damage was incurred. [SEP] [CLS] The effects of Hazel were particularly unprecedented in Toronto due to a combination of heavy rainfall during the preceding weeks, a lack of experience in dealing with tropical storms, and the storm's unexpected retention of power despite traveling 1,100 km (680 mi) over land. [SEP] [CLS] The storm stalled over the Toronto area, and although it was now extratropical, it remained as powerful as a category 1 hurricane. [SEP] [CLS] To help with the cleanup, 800 members of the military were summoned, and a Hurricane Relief Fund was established that distributed $5.1 million (2019: $48.6 million) in aid. [SEP] [CLS]
