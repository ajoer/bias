[CLS] Hurricane Catarina or Cyclone Catarina (Portuguese pronunciation: [kataˈɾinɐ]) was an extremely rare South Atlantic tropical cyclone, the only recorded hurricane strength storm on record in the South Atlantic Ocean. [SEP] [CLS] It struck South Brazil at near peak intensity with the equivalent of Category 2 hurricane-force winds. [SEP] [CLS] The storm developed out of a stationary cold-core upper-level trough on March 12. [SEP] [CLS] Almost a week later, on March 19, a disturbance developed along the trough and traveled towards the east-southeast until March 22 when a ridge stopped the forward motion of the disturbance. [SEP] [CLS] The disturbance was in an unusually favorable environment with a slightly below-average wind shear and above-average sea surface temperatures. [SEP] [CLS] The combination of the two led to a slow transition from an extratropical cyclone to a subtropical cyclone by March 24. [SEP] [CLS] The storm continued to obtain tropical characteristics and became a tropical storm the next day while the winds steadily increased. [SEP] [CLS] The storm attained wind speeds of 121 km/h (75 mph)—equivalent to a low-end Category 1 hurricane on the Saffir–Simpson scale—on March 26. [SEP] [CLS] At that time, it was unofficially named Catarina and was also the first hurricane-strength tropical cyclone ever recorded in the Southern Atlantic Ocean. [SEP] [CLS] Unusually favorable conditions persisted and Catarina continued to intensify, and was estimated to have peaked with 1-minute sustained winds of 160 km/h (100 mph) on March 28. [SEP] [CLS] The center of the storm made landfall between the cities of Passo de Torres and Balneário Gaivota, Santa Catarina. [SEP] [CLS] Catarina rapidly weakened upon landfall and dissipated later that day. [SEP] [CLS] Since Catarina was the first tropical cyclone to make landfall in Brazil since the beginning of reliable records, and hence infrastructure and the population were not specifically prepared for it, the damage was quite severe. [SEP] [CLS] Although the storm was an unprecedented event, Brazilian officials took the appropriate actions and warned the public about the approaching storm. [SEP] [CLS] Residents heeded the warnings and prepared for the storm by either evacuating or by riding it out in their homes. [SEP] [CLS] Catarina ended up destroying 1,500 homes and damaging around 40,000 others. [SEP] [CLS] Agricultural products were severely damaged: 85% of the banana crops and 40% of the rice crops were lost in the storm. [SEP] [CLS] Three people were confirmed to have perished in the storm and 185 others were injured. [SEP] [CLS] Damages from the storm amounted to US$350 million (value in 2004). [SEP] [CLS]
