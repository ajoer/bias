Tropical Storm Debby caused extensive flooding in North Florida and Central Florida during late June 2012. [CLS] [SEP] The fourth tropical cyclone and named storm of the 2012 Atlantic hurricane season, Debby developed from a trough of low pressure in the central Gulf of Mexico on June 23. [CLS] [SEP] The formation of Debby marked the earliest formation on record of the fourth named storm within the Atlantic basin until this record was beaten by Tropical Storm Danielle in 2016. [CLS] [SEP] Despite a projected track toward landfall in Louisiana or Texas, the storm headed the opposite direction, moving slowly north-northeast and northeastward. [CLS] [SEP] The storm slowly strengthened, and at 1800 UTC on June 25, attained its peak intensity with maximum sustained winds of 65 mph (100 km/h). [CLS] [SEP] Dry air, westerly wind shear, and upwelling of cold waters prevented further intensification over the next 24 hours. [CLS] [SEP] Instead, Debby weakened, and by late on June 26, it was a minimal tropical storm. [CLS] [SEP] At 2100 UTC, the storm made landfall near Steinhatchee, Florida with winds of 40 mph (65 km/h). [CLS] [SEP] Once inland, the system continued to weaken while crossing Florida, and dissipated shortly after emerging into the Atlantic on June 27. [CLS] [SEP] The storm dropped immense amounts of precipitation near its path. [CLS] [SEP] Rainfall peaked at 28.78 inches (731 mm) in Curtis Mill, Florida, located in southwestern Wakulla County. [CLS] [SEP] The Sopchoppy River, which reached its record height, flooded at least 400 structures in Wakulla County. [CLS] [SEP] Additionally, the Suwannee River reached its highest level since Hurricane Dora in 1964. [CLS] [SEP] Further south in Pasco County, the Anclote River and Pithlachascotee River overflowed, flooding communities with "head deep" water and causing damage to 106 homes. [CLS] [SEP] An additional 587 homes were inundated after the Black Creek overflowed in Clay County. [CLS] [SEP] Several roads and highways in North Florida were left impassable, including Interstate 10 and U.S. [CLS] [SEP] Route 90. [CLS] [SEP] U.S. [CLS] [SEP] Routes 19 and 98 were also inundated by coastal flooding. [CLS] [SEP] In Central and South Florida, damage was primarily caused by tornadoes, one of which caused a fatality. [CLS] [SEP] Overall, Debby caused at least $250 million in losses and 10 deaths, 8 in Florida and 1 each in Alabama and South Carolina. [CLS] [SEP]
