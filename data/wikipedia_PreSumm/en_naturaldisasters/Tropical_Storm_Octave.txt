[CLS] The 2019 Pacific hurricane season was a near average season which produced nineteen named storms, though most were rather weak and short-lived. [SEP] [CLS] Only seven hurricanes formed, the fewest since 2010. [SEP] [CLS] The season officially began on May 15 in the East Pacific Ocean, and on June 1 in the Central Pacific; they ended on November 30. [SEP] [CLS] These dates conventionally delimit the period of each year when most tropical cyclones form in the Pacific basin. [SEP] [CLS] However, the formation of tropical cyclones is possible at any time of the year. [SEP] [CLS] The season had a rather slow start, with no tropical cyclones forming in the basin during the month of May for the first time since 2016, and the first time that no storms formed before the month of June since 2011. [SEP] [CLS] The season became the latest-starting Pacific hurricane season on record since reliable records began in 1971 with the first tropical depression, which eventually became Hurricane Alvin, forming on June 25. [SEP] [CLS] The strongest hurricane of the season, Barbara, formed on June 30 and peaked as a high-end Category 4 hurricane on July 3. [SEP] [CLS] August was extremely quiet with no hurricanes forming during the month, a first for a season since 1973. [SEP] [CLS] September was much more active with six systems developing, of which three became hurricanes. [SEP] [CLS] Activity decreased appreciably in October and November as most of the storms remained weak and short-lived. [SEP] [CLS] Land impact was relatively minimal. [SEP] [CLS] The remnants of Barbara caused power outages in Hawaii in early July. [SEP] [CLS] Hurricanes Erick and Flossie both threatened Hawaii, but the systems weakened significantly before reaching the islands, both causing minimal effects. [SEP] [CLS] Tropical Storm Ivo and Hurricane Juliette both brought strong winds to Clarion Island. [SEP] [CLS] In late September, Hurricane Lorena made landfall in southwestern Mexico and Baja California Sur, and its remnant moisture entered the southwestern United States. [SEP] [CLS] Lorena was responsible for one death and damages worth $910,000. [SEP] [CLS] Tropical Storm Narda took a nearly identical track a week later, killing six and causing $15.2 million in damage. [SEP] [CLS] Overall, this season was drastically less active and destructive than the previous year, causing about $16.1 million in damages and seven fatalities. [SEP] [CLS]
