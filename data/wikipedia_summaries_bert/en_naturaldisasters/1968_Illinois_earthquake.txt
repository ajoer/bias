The 1968 Illinois earthquake (a New Madrid event) was the largest recorded earthquake in the U.S. [CLS] [SEP] Midwestern state of Illinois. [CLS] [SEP] Striking at 11:02 a.m. [CLS] [SEP] on November 9, it measured 5.4 on the Richter scale. [CLS] [SEP] Although there were no fatalities, the event caused considerable structural damage to buildings, including the toppling of chimneys and shaking in Chicago, the region's largest city. [CLS] [SEP] The earthquake was one of the most widely felt in U.S. [CLS] [SEP] history, largely affecting 23 states over an area of 580,000 square miles (1,500,000 km2). [CLS] [SEP] In studying its cause, scientists discovered the Cottage Grove Fault in the Southern Illinois Basin. [CLS] [SEP] Within the region, millions felt the rupture. [CLS] [SEP] Reactions to the earthquake varied: some people near the epicenter did not react to the shaking, while others panicked. [CLS] [SEP] A future earthquake in the region is extremely likely; in 2005, seismologists and geologists estimated a 90% chance of a magnitude 6–7 tremor before 2055, likely originating in the Wabash Valley seismic zone on the Illinois–Indiana border or the New Madrid fault zone.
