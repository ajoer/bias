Intense Tropical Cyclone Dina was a cyclone that caused record flooding across parts of Réunion. [CLS] [SEP] Originating from a tropical disturbance on 15 January 2002 near the Chagos Archipelago, the precursor to Dina quickly developed within a region favoring tropical cyclogenesis. [CLS] [SEP] By January 17, the system had developed enough organized convection as it moved southwestward to be declared a tropical depression. [CLS] [SEP] Rapid intensification occurred shortly thereafter, with the system attaining winds in excess of 120 km/h (75 mph) on January 18. [CLS] [SEP] Dina achieved its peak intensity on January 20 as an intense tropical cyclone with maximum sustained winds of 215 km/h (130 mph). [CLS] [SEP] Hours after reaching hits strength, the storm bypassed Rodrigues Island about 150 km (93 mi) to its north. [CLS] [SEP] On January 21, the storm brushed Mauritius and Réunion as an intense tropical cyclone before turning southward. [CLS] [SEP] Once on a southward course, steady weakening ensued and the system eventually transitioned into an extratropical cyclone on January 25. [CLS] [SEP] The remnants of the storm accelerated southeastward and were last noted on January 28 before being absorbed into a polar trough. [CLS] [SEP] Across Mauritius and Réunion, torrential rains and destructive winds from the cyclone resulted in extensive to "catastrophic" damage. [CLS] [SEP] The entire island of Mauritius lost power during the storm and widespread structural damage took place. [CLS] [SEP] Agricultural and property damage amounted to US$47 million and US$50 million respectively in the republic. [CLS] [SEP] Nine fatalities were attributed to the storm in Mauritius: five off the coast of Rodrigues Island and four on the main island. [CLS] [SEP] More extensive damage was seen on Réunion where up to 2,102 mm (82.8 in) of rain fell over three days. [CLS] [SEP] Record to near-record flooding destroyed many homes, washed out roads, and caused catastrophic agricultural damage. [CLS] [SEP] Destructive winds, measured up to 280 km/h (170 mph) also crippled communications. [CLS] [SEP] In all, six people died on the island and losses were estimated at €200 million (US$190 million). [CLS] [SEP]
