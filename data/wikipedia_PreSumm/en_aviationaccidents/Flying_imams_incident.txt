[CLS] On November 20, 2006, 6:30 pm, six Muslim imams were removed from US Airways Flight 300 to Phoenix, Arizona, at Minneapolis-Saint Paul International Airport, because several passengers and crew members became alarmed by what they felt was suspicious behavior. [SEP] [CLS] The airline has stated that the captain delayed takeoff and called airport security workers to ask the imams to leave the plane; the men refused, and that the captain then called police. [SEP] [CLS] The plane left without the imams on board about three hours later. [SEP] [CLS] The imams were arrested, questioned, and then released. [SEP] [CLS] The imams, along with the Muslim American Society and the Council on American-Islamic Relations, have brought high-profile complaints and demonstrations against the airline, saying they were removed from the airplane solely due to religious discrimination. [SEP] [CLS] Investigations by the airline and police reported that the airline and ground crews responded to security concerns properly in removing the men from the plane.On July 24, 2009, U.S. [SEP] [CLS] District Judge Ann Montgomery allowed a discrimination lawsuit filed by the imams to proceed, saying, "The right not to be arrested in the absence of probable cause is clearly established and, based on the allegations ... [SEP] [CLS] no reasonable officer could have believed that the arrest of the Plaintiffs was proper."
