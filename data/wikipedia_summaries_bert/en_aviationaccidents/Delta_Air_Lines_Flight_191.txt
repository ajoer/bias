[CLS] [SEP] On August 2, 1985, the Lockheed L-1011 TriStar operating Flight 191 encountered a microburst while on approach to land at DFW. [CLS] [SEP] The aircraft struck the ground over one mile (1.6 km) short of the runway, struck a car near the airport, and then collided with two water tanks and disintegrated. [CLS] [SEP] The crash killed 137 people and injured 28 others. [CLS] [SEP] The National Transportation Safety Board (NTSB) determined that the crash resulted from the flight crew's decision to fly through a thunderstorm, the lack of procedures or training to avoid or escape microbursts, and the lack of hazard information on wind shear.
