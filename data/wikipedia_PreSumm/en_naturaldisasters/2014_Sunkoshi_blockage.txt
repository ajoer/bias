[CLS] On 2 August 2014, due to heavy rainfall, a landslide occurred at the Sunkoshi river, killing 156 people and blocking the river to form an artificial lake in Sindhupalchok District, Nepal. [SEP] [CLS] Araniko Highway, the main (and only) artery of goods and people flow to China, was blocked by the landslide ripping out 5 km of highway, and causing huge traffic jam. [SEP] [CLS] 2 dozens houses have been swept by the landslide. [SEP] [CLS] The landslide had a volume of 5.5 million cubic metres.This landslide had massive effects far beyond, not evident from the pictures. [SEP] [CLS] The dammed river was threatening to unleash a torrent of water to hundreds of downstream villages that would ravage as far as Northern India. [SEP] [CLS] Despite the use of dynamite, it took the Nepali Army 45 days to dig a canal through the blockage to allow water in the lake to drain. [SEP] [CLS] The lake created was 47 meters deep and over 400 meters long. [SEP] [CLS] The hasty emergency draining through the lake canal itself caused damage to houses downstream and threatens to take out Lamusanghu Hydropower Dam. [SEP] [CLS]
