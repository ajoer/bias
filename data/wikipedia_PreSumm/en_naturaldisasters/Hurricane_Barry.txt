[CLS] Hurricane Barry was an asymmetrical Category 1 hurricane that made landfall in Louisiana in July 2019. [SEP] [CLS] Barry was the wettest tropical cyclone on record in Arkansas and the fourth-wettest in Louisiana. [SEP] [CLS] Barry originated as a mesoscale convective vortex over the Midwest on July 2. [SEP] [CLS] The system eventually emerged into the Gulf of Mexico on July 10, whereupon the National Hurricane Center (NHC) designated it as a potential tropical cyclone later. [SEP] [CLS] Early on July 11, the system developed into a tropical depression and later into the second named storm of the 2019 Atlantic hurricane season. [SEP] [CLS] On July 13, Barry attained maximum 1-minute sustained winds of 75 mph (120 km/h), with a minimum central pressure of 993 millibars (29.3 inHg), becoming the first hurricane of the season. [SEP] [CLS] Later that day, Barry made landfall on Marsh Island and second landfall in Intracoastal City, Louisiana, both times as a Category 1 hurricane. [SEP] [CLS] Barry subsequently weakened to tropical storm status soon after due to land interaction. [SEP] [CLS] The storm continued weakening, and finally degenerated into a remnant low over northern Arkansas on July 15, before dissipating on July 19. [SEP] [CLS] Barry was one of four hurricanes to hit Louisiana at that intensity in the month of July, the others being Bob in 1979, Danny in 1997, and Cindy in 2005. [SEP] [CLS] Numerous Tropical Storm watches and warnings were issued ahead of the storm. [SEP] [CLS] As Barry was predicted to make landfall as a hurricane, the Tropical Storm warnings were later upgraded into Hurricane warnings. [SEP] [CLS] Officials warned of significant impacts from Barry, including high winds, storm surge, and several feet of rain. [SEP] [CLS] Hurricane Barry only produced hurricane-force winds in a small area of Louisiana. [SEP] [CLS] Its large circulation produced heavy rainfall over a large area, reaching 23.43 in (595 mm) near Ragley, Louisiana, and 16.59 inches (42.1 cm) near Dierks, Arkansas. [SEP] [CLS] The latter value was the highest amount of rainfall recorded in Arkansas related to a tropical cyclone. [SEP] [CLS] One indirect fatality was attributed to Barry, and the damage was estimated to be about $600 million (2019 USD). [SEP] [CLS]
